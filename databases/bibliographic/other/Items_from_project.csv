"Despite the enormous economic and ecological importance of marine organisms, the spatial scales of adaptation and biocomplexity remain largely unknown. Yet, the preservation of local stocks that possess adaptive diversity is critical to the long-term maintenance of productive stable fisheries and ecosystems. Here, we document genomic evidence of range-wide adaptive differentiation in a broadcast spawning marine fish, Atlantic cod ( Gadus morhua ), using a genome survey of single nucleotide polymorphisms. Of 1641 gene-associated polymorphisms examined, 70 (4.2%) tested positive for signatures of selection using a Bayesian approach. We identify a subset of these loci ( n = 40) for which allele frequencies show parallel temperature-associated clines ( p < 0.001, r 2 = 0.89) in the eastern and western north Atlantic. Temperature associations were robust to the statistical removal of geographic distance or latitude effects, and contrasted ‘neutral’ loci, which displayed no temperature association. Allele frequencies at temperature-associated loci were significantly correlated, spanned three linkage groups and several were successfully annotated supporting the involvement of multiple independent genes. Our results are consistent with the evolution and/or selective sweep of multiple genes in response to ocean temperature, and support the possibility of a new conservation paradigm for non-model marine organisms based on genomic approaches to resolving functional and adaptive diversity.","Bradbury, Ian R.",2010,10.1098/rspb.2010.0985,1701,3725-3734,Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,Parallel adaptive evolution of Atlantic cod on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean in response to temperature,277,Article,Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic cod; local adaptation; natural selection; single nucleotide polymorphysm; temperature
"Understanding patterns of dispersal and connectivity among marine populations can directly inform fisheries conservation and management. Advances in high-throughput sequencing offer new opportunities for estimating marine connectivity. We used restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing to examine dispersal and realized connectivity in the sea scallop Placopecten magellanicus, an economically important marine bivalve. Based on 245 individuals sampled rangewide at 12 locations from Newfoundland to the Mid-Atlantic Bight, we identified and genotyped 7163 single nucleotide polymorphisms; 112 (1.6%) were identified as outliers potentially under directional selection. Bayesian clustering revealed a discontinuity between northern and southern samples, and latitudinal clines in allele frequencies were observed in 42.9% of the outlier loci and in 24.6% of neutral loci. Dispersal estimates derived using these clines and estimates of linkage disequilibrium imply limited dispersal; 373.1 ± 407.0 km (mean ± SD) for outlier loci and 641.0 ± 544.6 km (mean ± SD) for neutral loci. Our analysis suggests restricted dispersal compared to the species range (>2000 km) and that dispersal and effective connectivity differ. These observations support the hypothesis that limited effective dispersal structures scallop populations along eastern North America. These findings can help refine the appropriate scale of management and conservation in this commercially valuable species.","Van Wyngaarden, Mallory",2017,10.1111/eva.12432,1,102-117,Evolutionary Applications,"Identifying patterns of dispersal, connectivity and selection in the sea scallop, Placopecten magellanicus, using RADseq-derived SNPs",10,Article,RADseq; connectivity; dispersal; outlier loci; population genomics; population structure; sea scallop; single nucleotide polymorphysm
"Genomic studies of invasive species can reveal both invasive pathways and functional differences underpinning patterns of colonization success. The European green crab (Carcinus maenas) was initially introduced to eastern North America nearly 200 years ago where it expanded northwards to eastern Nova Scotia. A subsequent invasion to Nova Scotia from a northern European source allowed further range expansion, providing a unique opportunity to study the invasion genomics of a species with multiple invasions. Here, we use restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing-derived SNPs to explore fine-scale genomewide differentiation between these two invasions. We identified 9137 loci from green crab sampled from 11 locations along eastern North America and compared spatial variation to mitochondrial COI sequence variation used previously to characterize these invasions. Overall spatial divergence among invasions was high (pairwise FST ~0.001 to 0.15) and spread across many loci, with a mean FST ~0.052 and 52% of loci examined characterized by FST values >0.05. The majority of the most divergent loci (i.e., outliers, ~1.2%) displayed latitudinal clines in allele frequency highlighting extensive genomic divergence among the invasions. Discriminant analysis of principal components (both neutral and outlier loci) clearly resolved the two invasions spatially and was highly correlated with mitochondrial divergence. Our results reveal extensive cryptic intraspecific genomic diversity associated with differing patterns of colonization success and demonstrates clear utility for genomic approaches to delineating the distribution and colonization success of aquatic invasive species.","Jeffery, Nicholas W.",2017,10.1002/ece3.2872,8,2513-2524,Ecology and Evolution,RAD sequencing reveals genomewide divergence between independent invasions of the European green crab ( Carcinus maenas ) in the Northwest Atlantic,7,Article,COI; Carcinus maenas; European green crab; population structure; restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing
"The spatial genetic structure of most species in the open marine environment remains largely unresolved. This information gap creates uncertainty in the sustainable management, recovery, and associated resilience of marine communities and our capacity to extrapolate beyond the few species for which such information exists. We document a previously unidentified multispecies biogeographic break aligned with a steep climatic gradient and driven by seasonal temperature minima in the northwest Atlantic. The coherence of this genetic break across our five study species with contrasting life histories suggests a pervasive macroecological phenomenon. The integration of this genetic structure with habitat suitability models and climate forecasts predicts significant variation in northward distributional shifts among populations and availability of suitable habitat in future oceans. The results of our integrated approach provide new perspective on how cryptic intraspecific diversity associated with climatic variation influences species and community response to climate change beyond simple poleward shifts.","Stanley, Ryan R.

"Identification of genetic changes that allow a species to adapt to different environmental conditions is an important topic in evolutionary biology. In this study we analyzed whole-genome resequencing data of Atlantic herring populations from both sides of the Atlantic Ocean and identified a number of loci that show consistent associations with spawning time (spring or autumn). Several of these loci, such as thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor ( TSHR ), have a well-established role in reproductive biology, whereas others have never been implicated in controlling reproduction. Genetic variants associated with adaptation to spring or autumn spawning are shared to a large extent among populations across the Atlantic Ocean and the Baltic Sea, providing evidence for parallel adaptive evolution.","Lamichhaney, Sangeet",2017,10.1073/pnas.1617728114,17,E3452-E3461,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,Parallel adaptive evolution of geographically distant herring populations on both sides of the North Atlantic Ocean,114,Article,Atlantic herring; genetic adaptation; parallel evolution; reproductive strategies; whole-genome sequencing

"Effective fishery management strategies should be based on stock delimitation and knowledge of the spatial scale at which species are distributed. However, a mismatch often occurs between biological and management units of fishery resources. The green abalone ( Haliotis fulgens ) supports an important artisanal fishery in the west coast of the Baja California Peninsula (BCP), Mexico, which has shown a declining tendency despite the several management measures. Thus, the aim of this study was to characterize the spatial patterns of neutral genomic variation of green abalone along the BCP to test whether the genomic structure patterns support the current green abalone management areas. To test this hypothesis, a set of 2,170 putative neutral single nucleotide polymorphisms discovered by a double digest restriction-site associated DNA approach was used on 10 locations along the BCP. The results revealed a population structure with three putative groups: Guadalupe Island and northern and southern BCP locations. The contemporary gene flow might be explained by local oceanographic features, where it is bidirectional within the southern region but with a predominant southward flow from the northern region. These findings indicated that the administrative areas did not match the biological units of H. fulgens fishery; hence, the stock assessment and management areas should be revised.","Mejía-Ruíz, Paulina",2020,10.7717/peerj.9722,,e9722,PeerJ,Population genomics reveals a mismatch between management and biological units in green abalone ( Haliotis fulgens ),8,Article,abalone; ddRAD-seq; fisheries management; green abalone; Haliotis fulgens; population genomics; SNPs
"The accurate definition of population units (stocks) and local adaptation are the cornerstones of fishery management. Unfortunately, this knowledge is unknown mainly for abalone species in the Northeast Pacific, where stocks have failed to recover. The pink abalone (Haliotis corrugata) is a fishing resource on the western coast of the Baja California Peninsula (BCP) and is currently catalogued as diminished with a recovery trending pattern. This research determined if the biological units matched the administrative and stock assessment units along the west coast of the BCP and the implications for fishery management. To test this hypothesis, a double digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing approach was used to generate 1 733 neutral and 6 putative outlier loci for population genomic analysis. Neutral markers detected a smooth partition in two regional groups, the southern (San Juanico, La Bocana, Bahía Asunción, Puerto Escondido, Punta Eugenia, and Natividad Island) and northern regions (Cedros Island, Faro San José, San Jerónimo Island, and Guadalupe Island). Putative outlier loci indicated evident differentiation of those groups. The population subdivision at 28° latitude with both marker types was related to a biogeographic boundary. Results did not support the current administrative zones of pink abalone fisheries and contrasted with genetic homogeneity reports in the region.","Alberto Mares-Mayagoitia, Jorge",2021,10.1093/icesjms/fsab098,5,1909-1919,ICES Journal of Marine Science,Neutral and adaptive population structure of pink abalone ( Haliotis corrugata ): fishery management implications,78,Article,ddRAD; Haliotis corrugata; pink abalone; population genomics
"Background: The degree of genetic differentiation among populations experiencing high levels of gene flow is expected to be low for neutral genomic sites, but substantial divergence can occur in sites subject to directional selection. Studies of highly mobile marine fish populations provide an opportunity to investigate this kind of heterogeneous genomic differentiation, but most studies to this effect have focused on a relatively low number of genetic markers and/or few populations. Hence, the patterns and extent of genomic divergence in high-gene-flow marine fish populations remain poorly understood. Results: We here investigated genome-wide patterns of genetic variability and differentiation in ten marine populations of three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) distributed across a steep salinity and temperature gradient in the Baltic Sea, by utilizing >30,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms obtained with a pooled RAD-seq approach. We found that genetic diversity and differentiation varied widely across the genome, and identified numerous fairly narrow genomic regions exhibiting signatures of both divergent and balancing selection. Evidence was uncovered for substantial genetic differentiation associated with both salinity and temperature gradients, and many candidate genes associated with local adaptation in the Baltic Sea were identified. Conclusions: The patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation, as well as candidate genes associated with adaptation, in Baltic Sea sticklebacks were similar to those observed in earlier comparisons between marine and freshwater populations, suggesting that similar processes may be driving adaptation to brackish and freshwater environments. Taken together, our results provide strong evidence for heterogenic genomic divergence driven by local adaptation in the face of gene flow along an environmental gradient in the post-glacially formed Baltic Sea.","Guo, Baocheng",2015,10.1186/s12915-015-0130-8,1,19,BMC Biology,Population genomic evidence for adaptive differentiation in Baltic Sea three-spined sticklebacks,13,Article,Baltic Sea; Gasterosteus acucelatus; RAD-sequencing; SNPs; local adaptation; population differentiation
