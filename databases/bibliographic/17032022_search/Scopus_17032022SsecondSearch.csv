We dissected here the contribution of both processes to increased tolerance in Chironomus riparius to cadmium (Cd) exposure in a multi-generation experiment and inferred the underlying genomic basis. We simulated environmentally realistic conditions by continuously increasing contaminant concentration in six replicates initiated with 1000 larvae each, three pre-exposed to Cd and three not exposed to Cd (no-Cd) over eight generations. We measured life-cycle traits, transcriptomic responses and genome-wide allele frequency changes from this evolve and resequencing (E&R) experiment. Overall, life cycle tests revealed little phenotypic adaptation to Cd exposure, but a slightly increase in survival in the first larval stage was observed. Population genomic analyses showed a strong genome-wide selective response in all replicates, highlighting two main biological functions involved in development and growth of the chironomids. Emphasizing that laboratory conditions continually exert selective pressure. However, the integration of the transcriptomic to the genomic data allowed to distinguish pathways specifically selected by the Cd exposure related to microtubules and organelles and cellular movement. Those pathways could be functionally related to an excretion of metals. Thus, our results indicate that genetic adaptation to Cd in C. riparius can happen within few generations under an environmentally relevant exposure scenario, but substantial phenotypic tolerance might take more time to arise. With our approach, we introduce an experimental setup to fill the existing gap in evolutionary ecotoxicology to investigate these early signs of genetic adaptation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation; Chironomids; Genomics; Toxic metal; Whole genome sequencing","Animals; Genes; Life cycle; Population statistics; Adaptation; Cadmium exposure; Chironomids; Chironomus riparius; Evolutionary adaptation; Exposed to; Phenotypic plasticity; Toxic metals; Transcriptomics; Whole genome sequencing; Genome; cadmium; adaptation; cadmium; fly; genomics; phenotypic plasticity; RNA; toxic substance; animal experiment; Article; cell organelle; Chironomidae; Chironomus riparius; concentration (parameter); contamination; controlled study; environmental exposure; evolutionary adaptation; female; gene frequency; genetic analysis; genomics; larval stage; life cycle; microtubule; nonhuman; phenotype; RNA sequencing; simulation; survival; transcriptomics; whole genome sequencing",Article,"",Scopus

Range expansion can lead to reduced genetic diversity and increased frequency of deleterious mutations that were rare in core populations, potentially limiting the ability for adaptation and persistence in novel environments. Successful expansions that overcome these founder effects and colonize new habitat have been attributed to multiple introductions from different sources, hybridization with native populations, or rapid adaptive evolution. Here, we investigate population genomic patterns of the reef-building coral Acropora hyacinthus along a latitudinal cline that includes a well-established range expansion front in Japan using 2b-RAD sequencing. A total of 184 coral samples were collected across seven sites spanning from ~24°N to near its northern range front at ~33°N. We uncover the presence of three cryptic lineages of A. hyacinthus, which occupy discrete reefs within this region. Only one lineage is present along the expansion front and we find evidence for its historical occupation of marginal habitats. Within this lineage we also find evidence of bottleneck pressures associated with expansion events including higher clonality, increased linkage disequilibrium, and lower genetic diversity in range edge populations compared to core populations. Asymmetric migration between populations was also detected with lower migration from edge sites. Lastly, we describe genomic signatures of local adaptation potentially attributed to lower winter temperatures experienced at the more recently expanded northern populations. Together these data illuminate the genomic consequences of range expansion in a coral and highlight how adaptation to discrete environments along expansion fronts may facilitate further range expansion in this temperate coral lineage. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","2bRAD-seq; Adaptation; Coral; Cryptic lineage; Population genomics; Range expansion","Biodiversity; Ecosystems; Expansion; Reefs; 2bRAD-seq; Adaptation; Coral; Cryptic lineage; Genetic divergence; Genetics diversities; Genomics; Population genomic; Range expansion; Western North Pacific; Genes; adaptation; coral; genomics; hybridization; population genetics; range expansion; Acropora; article; clonal variation; coral; gene linkage disequilibrium; genetic variability; habitat; Hyacinthus; Japan; local adaptation; major clinical study; nonhuman; occupation; population genomics; winter; acclimatization; adaptation; animal; Anthozoa; coral reef; ecosystem; genetic variation; genetics; temperature; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); Acclimatization; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Anthozoa; Coral Reefs; Ecosystem; Genetic Variation; Temperature",Article,"",Scopus

From an evolutionary ecological perspective, they allow teasing apart the relative contributions of plasticity and evolutionary divergence in driving rapid phenotypic diversification. When IAS spread across extensive geographic ranges, climatic variation may represent a source of strong natural selection through overwinter mortality and summer heat stress. This could favour local adaptation, i.e., evolutionary divergence of certain traits. IAS, however, are likely to show plasticity in survival-related traits, and environmental fluctuation in their new distribution range could favour the maintenance of this pre-existing phenotypic plasticity. By contrast, sexually selected traits are more likely to undergo evolutionary divergence when components of sexual selection differ geographically. Here, using data from a common-garden rearing experiment of Western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis Baird and Girard, 1853) from five populations across the species' invasive range in China, we show that invasive mosquitofish have retained plasticity in key physiological (thermal tolerances), morphological and life-history traits even 100 years after their introduction to China, but exhibit heritable population differences in several sexually selected traits, including the shape of the male copulatory organ. Adaptive plasticity of traits linked to immediate survival in different thermal environments—while likely responsible for the species' extraordinary invasion success—could slow down genetic evolution. Several sexually selected traits could diverge geographically and show rapid evolutionary change, e.g., because climate alters selective landscapes arising from mate competition as an indirect consequence of variation in overwinter mortality. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptive plasticity; Biological invasion; Gambusia affinis; Local adaptation; Rapid evolution; Thermal tolerance","Biology; Climate change; Ecology; Adaptive plasticity; Biological invasion; Gambusia affinis; Geographic ranges; Invasive alien species; Invasive fishes; Local adaptation; Rapid evolution; Relative contribution; Thermal tolerance; Population statistics; biological invasion; cyprinid; divergence; fish; invasive species; natural selection; phenotypic plasticity; sexual behavior; temperature tolerance; adult; article; China; climate; competition; controlled study; Gambusia affinis; heat tolerance; introduced species; life history trait; local adaptation; male; mortality; nonhuman; phenotypic plasticity; rearing; sexual selection; species invasion; adaptation; animal; Cyprinodontiformes; ecosystem; evolution; introduced species; phenotype; China; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Biological Evolution; Cyprinodontiformes; Ecosystem; Introduced Species; Male; Phenotype",Article,"",Scopus

To cope with stress, many organisms locally adapt, but how such adaptations affect the ability of an organism to manage co-occurring stressors is not well understood. In aquatic ecosystems, elevated temperatures and harmful algal blooms are common co-stressors. To better understand the role and potential trade-offs of local adaptations for mitigating the effects of stressors, Daphnia pulicaria genotypes that varied in their ability to consume toxic cyanobacteria prey (i.e., three tolerant and three sensitive) were exposed to five diets that included combinations of toxic cyanobacteria, Microcystis aeruginosa, and a green alga, Ankistrodesmus falcatus, under two temperatures (20 °C vs. 28 °C). A path analysis was conducted to understand how local adaptations affect energy allocation to intermediate life history traits (i.e., somatic growth, fecundity, survival) that maximize Daphnia fitness (i.e., population growth rate). Results from the 10-day study show that tolerant Daphnia genotypes had higher fitness than sensitive genotypes regardless of diet or temperature treatment, suggesting toxic cyanobacteria tolerance did not cause a decrease in fitness in the absence of cyanobacteria or under elevated temperatures. Results from the path analysis demonstrated that toxic cyanobacteria had a stronger effect on life history traits than temperature and that population growth rate was mainly constrained by reduced fecundity. These findings suggest that local adaptations to toxic cyanobacteria and elevated temperatures are synergistic, leading to higher survivorship of cyanobacteria-tolerant genotypes during summer cyanobacterial bloom events. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; Daphnia; Harmful algal blooms (HABs); Path analysis; Toxic cyanobacteria","algal bloom; climate change; cyanobacterium; ecosystem structure; growth rate; life history trait; local adaptation; path analysis; population growth; survivorship; acclimatization; animal; cyanobacterium; Daphnia; ecosystem; Microcystis; Acclimatization; Animals; Cyanobacteria; Daphnia; Ecosystem; Microcystis",Article,"",Scopus

An offset measure between the GF-predicted environmental association of adapted alleles and a new environment (GF Offset) is increasingly being used to predict the loss of environmentally adapted alleles under rapid environmental change, but remains mostly untested for this purpose. Here, we explore the robustness of GF Offset to assumption violations, and its relationship to measures of fitness, using SLiM simulations with explicit genome architecture and a spatial metapopulation. We evaluate measures of GF Offset in: (1) a neutral model with no environmental adaptation; (2) a monogenic “population genetic” model with a single environmentally adapted locus; and (3) a polygenic “quantitative genetic” model with two adaptive traits, each adapting to a different environment. We found GF Offset to be broadly correlated with fitness offsets under both single locus and polygenic architectures. However, neutral demography, genomic architecture, and the nature of the adaptive environment can all confound relationships between GF Offset and fitness. GF Offset is a promising tool, but it is important to understand its limitations and underlying assumptions, especially when used in the context of predicting maladaptation. © 2022 The Authors.

Assessment of the consequence of such eco-evolutionary interactions is crucial to population's genetic diversity maintenance. Yet, considering how biogeographic and multiple evolutionary processes interact in complex environments to alter genetic diversity in conservation planning remains unresolved. Location: The Pacific Northwest. Methods: Herein I document the impact of geographic landscapes and past climatic fluctuations on the evolutionary processes that drive population divergence of Populus trichocarpa by assembling genomic, climatic and species occurrence data. Results: Based on inferences of demographic history of the species and tests for niche divergence, results show that the British Columbia (BC)-North and BC-South populations are ancestral and subject to more recent bottlenecks than the Oregon population. Consistently, ecological niche modelling illustrates that compared to the Last Glacial Maximum (~21 Ka), the present niche suitability of the BC-North and -South populations is overall marginally inferior to that of the Oregon population. However, genomic analysis demonstrates that the Oregon harbours the lowest genetic diversity, possibly due to an extended bottleneck experienced by the population. Model prediction indicates that in the 2050s, the impact of climate change is minor compared to the niche suitability of the species as a whole, but climate change will likely result in considerable genetic shifts over two generations especially in the Oregon and BC-South populations, which will attenuate along a northward gradient. Main conclusions: This study underpins the long-lasting impact of demographic histories and natural selection on genetic diversity, rather than highlighting the consequence of recent demographic events (e.g. bottleneck in the Holocene epoch; ~12 Ka) potentially cascading to eroding genetic diversity and yielding conservation urgency. © 2022 The Authors.

However, we still have a poor understanding of evolution at range limits and its capacity to change the ecological rules of engagement that define these communities, as well as the time frame over which this occurs. Here we link papers in the current volume to some key concepts involved in the interactions between evolutionary and ecological processes at species margins. In particular, we separate hypotheses about species margins that focus on hard evolutionary limits, which determine how genotypes interact with their environment, from those concerned with soft evolutionary limits, which determine where and when local adaptation can persist in space and time. We show how theoretical models and empirical studies highlight conditions under which gene flow can expand local limits as well as contain them. In doing so, we emphasize the complex interplay between selection, demography and population structure throughout a species geographical and ecological range that determines its persistence in biological communities. However, despite some impressively detailed studies on range limits, particularly in invertebrates and plants, few generalizations have emerged that can predict evolutionary responses at ecological margins. We outline some directions for future work such as considering the impact of structural genetic variants and metapopulation structure on limits, and the interaction between range limits and the evolution of mating systems and non-random dispersal. © 2022 Royal Society Publishing.

Instead, dispersal is often inferred from genetic markers and biophysical modelling where a correspondence indicates that dispersal routes and barriers explain a significant part of population genetic differentiation. Biophysical models are used for wind-driven dispersal in terrestrial environments and for propagules drifting with ocean currents in the sea. In the ocean, such seascape genetic or seascape genomic studies provide promising tools in applied sciences, as actions within management and conservation rely on an understanding of population structure, genetic diversity and presence of local adaptations, all dependent on dispersal within the metapopulation. Here, we surveyed 87 studies that combine population genetics and biophysical models of dispersal. Our aim was to understand if biophysical dispersal models can generally explain genetic differentiation. Our analysis shows that genetic differentiation and lack of genetic differentiation can often be explained by dispersal, but the realism of the biophysical model, as well as local geomorphology and species biology also play a role. The review supports the use of a combination of both methods, and we discuss our findings in terms of recommendations for future studies and pinpoint areas where further development is necessary, particularly on how to compare both approaches.

(2021) illustrate how the genetic architecture of adaptation and life history influence invasive success. A marvel of many invasive species is that they are incredibly successful despite evolutionary expectations that they will have low adaptive potential and suffer inbreeding depression due to initially small founding population sizes. Determining the combinations of ecoevolutionary factors that permit this apparent ""genetic paradox of invasions"" is an ongoing endeavour of invasive species research. Tepolt et al. (2021) study the European green crab in its invasive range on the North American west coast. Following a single introduction into California, this crab quickly spread across a wide latitude gradient, despite low diversity in the original founding population. Adaptation of this crab to clinal variation in temperature appeared largely driven by an inferred chromosomal inversion. This inversion exists as a balanced polymorphism in the European home range of green crabs and is associated with thermal tolerance. Tepolt et al. (2021) therefore demonstrate that adaptive evolution post introduction need not be impeded by bottlenecks if variation at key parts of the genome is available and can be maintained in introduced populations. Moreover, Tepolt et al.

Based on the presence or absence of pursuit predators, at least 17 species of fish repeatedly differentiated in body shape in a manner that increases burst swimming speed and the likelihood of predator escape. The predator-associated burst speed (PABS) ecophenotype is characterized by a small head and trunk and enlarged caudal region. Mechanisms promoting replicated phenotype-environment association include selection (without evolution), a single instance of adaptive evolution followed by biased habitat occupation, repeated instances of local adaptation, or adaptive phenotypic plasticity. Common garden rearing of mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis, demonstrated a likely heritable basis for PABS phenotypy, but it is unknown whether populations are otherwise genetically distinct or whether replicated ecophenotypy represents a single or replicated instances of adaptation. To genetically characterize the populations and test hypotheses of single or multiple adaptations, we characterized variation in 12 polymorphic DNA microsatellites in the previously studied G. affinis populations. Populations were genetically distinct by multilocus analysis, exhibited high allelic diversity, and were heterozygote deficient, which effects were attributed to G. affinis’s shoaling nature and habitat patchiness. Genetic and phenotypic distances among populations were correlated for non-PABS but not PABS morphology. Multilocus analysis demonstrated ecophenotype polyphyly and scattered multivariate genetic structure which support only the replicated-adaptation model. As all of the diverse tests performed demonstrated lack of congruence between patterns of molecular genetic and PABS differentiation, it is likely that divergent natural selection drove multiple instances of adaptive evolution. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Genetics Society.",,"fish; local adaptation; morphology; phenotype; population genetics; predator; article; Gambusia affinis; gene structure; genetic association; habitat patchiness; heterozygote; local adaptation; natural selection; nonhuman; occupation; phenotypic plasticity; polyphyly; population genetics; predator; rearing; velocity",Article,"",Scopus

Desert rainbowfish showed very small effective population sizes, especially at peripheral populations, and low connectivity between river catchments.

Alternative pathways such as environmentally induced genetic modifications and non-genetic heritable phenotypes have been proposed mechanisms for heritable adaptation within an ecologically relevant time frame. However, experimental evidence is currently lacking to establish if, and to what extent, these sources of phenotypic variation can produce a response. To test if adaptation can rapidly occur in the absence of initial standing genetic variation and recombination in small populations, we (a) exposed replicate monoclonal populations of the microzooplankton Brachionus calyciflorus to a culturing regime that selected for phenotypic variants with elevated population growth with either high or low phosphorus food for a period of 55 days and (b) examined population level response in two fully factorial common garden experiments at day 15 and 35 of the exposure experiment. Within six generations, we observed heritable local adaptation to nutrient limitation. More specifically, populations with a history of exposure to low P food exhibited higher population growth rates under low P food conditions than populations with a high P exposure history. However, the capacity for such a response was found to vary among clones. Our study finds that although standing genetic variation is considered essential for rapid heritable adaptation, the rapid emergence of de novo genetic variation or alternative sources of phenotypic variation could aid in the establishment and persistence of low-diversity populations.

Drastic loss in genetic diversity at such loci constitutes an extinction risk and should be monitored in species of conservation concern. However, effective implementations of genome-wide immune polymorphism sets into high-throughput genotyping assays are scarce. Here, we report the design and validation of a microfluidics-based amplicon sequencing assay to comprehensively capture genetic variation in Alpine ibex (Capra ibex). This species represents one of the most successful large mammal restorations recovering from a severely depressed census size and a massive loss in diversity at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). We analysed 65 whole-genome sequencing sets of the Alpine ibex and related species to select the most representative markers and to prevent primer binding failures. In total, we designed ~1,000 amplicons densely covering the MHC, further immunity-related genes as well as randomly selected genome-wide markers for the assessment of neutral population structure. Our analysis of 158 individuals shows that the genome-wide markers perform equally well at resolving population structure as RAD-sequencing or low-coverage genome sequencing data sets. Immunity-related loci show unexpectedly high degrees of genetic differentiation within the species. Such information can now be used to define highly targeted individual translocations. Our design strategy can be realistically implemented into genetic surveys of a large range of species.

This information can be used to make management decisions and reveal fundamental aspects of an organism's biology. Distinct intrinsic (e.g., biological characteristics) and extrinsic (e.g., geographical and historical events, environment, human pressures) factors can influence population structure, with significant differences among species. However, detection of population structure in migratory lamprey species can be difficult to detect due to their lack of natal homing; this is particularly the case for anadromous lampreys, with their potential for wide dispersal at sea during their parasitic feeding stage. We review phenotypic and genetic markers, as well as the methods that have been used to assess population structure in lampreys, and discuss the relative strengths and limitations of each. Structure has been detected in several anadromous species using some of these methods, even without homing in these species, but we briefly contrast the weak population structure observed in anadromous species with the stronger structure observed in freshwater-resident lamprey species (particularly non-migratory brook lampreys). We relate lamprey population structure to species-specific ecological traits, such as juvenile dispersal tendencies, and provide case studies of six species.

Little is known about the invertebrates in these habitats and their ability to cope with the brackish conditions of the marsh. We studied the population growth of ostracods found in an inland salt marsh (Maple River salt marsh) and of copepods found in the wetland habitat immediately adjacent to the freshwater Kalamazoo River. By studying these species in water from both habitats, we aimed to find out if they performed differently in the two habitats. We also tested Daphnia pulex in water from the two habitats due to the history of Daphnia spp. as model organisms. We found that copepods performed better in water taken from the Maple River salt marsh, and the ostracods and D. pulex performed equally well in either water. This was unexpected, since ostracods are found in the salt marsh and copepods in the freshwater area. As a second experiment, we tested the invertebrates in pairwise interactions. In water from the Kalamazoo River, ostracods outperformed the other two species, but there was no difference between D. pulex and copepods. No species outperformed the other in salt marsh water.

Here we show sub-regional patterns in delta tidal dynamics and coastal SLR along the northern Bay of Bengal based on long-term (1990 to 2017) in-situ measurement data. Seasonal trend decomposition combined with robust linear modelling are applied to determine rates of water level change, with an average rise in coastal extreme sea levels of 6.9 ± 2.1 mm yr−1 translating to increases of 5.1 ± 4.2 mm yr−1 in tidal water levels within the delta. Mean increases of 18.3 ± 4.1 mm yr−1 and 18.2 ± 6.8 mm yr−1 at high and low-tide respectively in tidally dominated rivers of southwest Bangladesh contrast with the fluvially active central and eastern sections of the delta where falling trends of −6.5 ± 2.3 mm yr−1 (high-tide) and −10.2 ± 3.1 mm yr−1 (low-tide) are recorded. Rapid changes in river level at individual sites can occur over periods of ca. 3 to 10 years, most likely resulting from short-term hydro-morphological changes. An acceleration of change in high-tides is indicated by a rise from the long term (1950 to 2018) rate of 4.4 ± 1.5 mm yr−1 to 5.9 ± 3.2 mm yr−1 between 1990 and 2017, leading to increased risk for the local population. At local and regional scales, the inland impact of SLR within the delta is observed to be strongly modulated, necessitating more detailed analysis of driving mechanisms at the site specific level. Our results can be used to aid development of adaptation strategies in Bangladesh and as a call for increased monitoring of hydro-morphological parameters within the Bengal delta and other large deltas in Asia and worldwide. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bangladesh; Bengal Delta; Coastal sea-level; SLR; Tidal water levels","Water levels; Adaptation strategies; Driving mechanism; Hydro-morphological parameters; In-situ measurement; Local populations; Local variations; Morphological changes; Water level changes; Sea level; adaptive management; aid organization; coastal morphology; coastal zone; in situ measurement; sea level change; trend analysis; water level; Bangladesh; Bay of Bengal; Indian Ocean",Article,"",Scopus

In Fiji, several communities have already initiated relocation, with hundreds more considered in need of future relocation by the Fijian government. Yet, often relocation is viewed as an inevitable response to coastal exposure, whereby an entire community is relocated from one location (of high exposure) to another (of lesser exposure) with the assistance of an external actor, namely the State and donors. Limited research has drawn attention to the heterogenous nature of relocation (and immobility responses), and the factors that shape these diverse processes. Drawing on fieldwork undertaken across seven low-lying communities in Fiji that are facing exposure to coastal erosion, tidal inundation, and storm surges, we highlight different immobility and relocation responses that are being implemented both within and across villages. These responses can be viewed along a continuum, referred to here as the immobility-relocation continuum, and include: voluntary immobility, immobility due to restricted relocation options, incremental relocation, partial relocation, and full community relocation. We identify factors - climatic and environmental, past and current adaptations and mobilities, socio-cultural, land rights and tenure, and institutional – that shape these varied responses. This research underscores the need to expand our thinking regarding how climate-related relocation is conceptualized and implemented in policy and practice toward a nuanced understanding of (im)mobility as a form of adaptation to coastal hazard risks, accounting for diversity in local conditions, preferences, and resources available to communities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Climate change; Decision making; Immobility; Local knowledge; Managed retreat; Migration; Sea-level rise","adaptation; Article; case study; climate change; coastal waters; community; controlled study; environmental change; environmental erosion; environmental factor; environmental impact; Fiji; government; hazard; household; human; institutionalization; land use; migration; natural science; population; rural population; social aspect; social class; storm surge",Article,"",Scopus

However, the distinctive biological characteristics and life history of this species, including large body size, long life span, late sexual maturity, and specialization to freezing polar waters, make it particularly vulnerable to overfishing and global climate change. It is therefore of fundamental importance to administer sound management and conservation actions to avoid depletion of this unique species. The crucial issue of whether this species consists of distinct biological units or stocks, which is needed to inform appropriate management and conservation, is currently unresolved. We report here the first RAD-seq analysis of Antarctic toothfish populations, a powerful approach of genome-wide discovery of SNP loci, to assess genetic differentiation between the geographically distant individuals from CCAMLAR Subarea 48.1 locations (South Shetland Islands and West Antarctic Peninsula coasts) and Subarea 88.1 (Ross Sea and McMurdo Sound). We recovered 19,611 SNPs belonging to 13,251 widely shared loci. Comprehensive population structure analyses unambiguously indicated absence of any significant level of population differentiation, thus the null hypothesis of panmixia cannot be rejected. Together with currently known life history traits of D. mawsoni, we suggest this striking lack of genomic differentiation likely reflects high degrees of contemporary and/or historical gene flow rather than shared spawning grounds.

ASF is defined as one of the most serious animal diseases identified to date, due to its global spread in regions of Africa, Europe and Asia, causing massive economic losses. On the Italian island of Sardinia, the disease has been endemic since 1978, although the last control measures put in place achieved a significant reduction in ASF, and the virus has been absent from circulation since April 2019. Like many large DNA viruses, ASFV mutates at a relatively slow rate. However, the limited availability of whole‐genome sequences from spatial‐localized outbreaks makes it difficult to explore the small‐scale genetic structure of these ASFV outbreaks. It is also unclear if the genetic variability within outbreaks can be captured in a handful of sequences, or if larger sequencing efforts can improve phylogenetic reconstruction and evolutionary or epidemiological inference. The aim of this study was to investigate the phylogenetic patterns of ASFV outbreaks between 1978 and 2018 in Sardinia, in order to characterize the epidemiological dynamics of the viral strains circulating in this Mediterranean island. To reach this goal, 58 new whole genomes of ASFV isolates were obtained, which represents the largest ASFV whole‐genome sequencing effort to date. We provided a complete description of the genomic diversity of ASFV in terms of nucleotide mutations and small and large indels among the isolates collected during the outbreaks. The new sequences capture more than twice the genomic and phylogenetic diversity of all the previously published Sardinian sequences. The extra genomic diversity increases the resolution of the phylogenetic reconstruction, enabling us to dissect, for the first time, the genetic substructure of the outbreak. We found multiple ASFV subclusters within the phylogeny of the Sardinian epidemic, some of which coexisted in space and time. © 2021 by the authors.

The salmonids are a taxonomic group with abundant genome-wide datasets due to their importance in aquaculture and fisheries. However, the number of documented SVs in salmonids is surprisingly low and is most likely due to removing loci in high linkage disequilibrium when analyzing structure and gene flow.

Rapid genetic adaptation of resident populations founded by early colonists to local conditions might prevent establishment of later-arriving lineages, resulting in an evolution-mediated priority effect. This might result in a limited window of opportunity for establishment during which the resident population did not have sufficient time yet to monopolize the patch through local adaptation. The length of this window of opportunity is expected to depend on the degree to which early colonists and immigrants are preadapted to local habitat conditions. We present an intraspecific competition model of the initial transient population and evolutionary dynamics that quantifies the window of opportunity for establishment for asexual species. The model explicitly addresses the long-lasting effects of evolution-mediated priority effects by tracking lineages through time. Our results show that the difference in initial pread-aptation between early colonists and late immigrants and the speed of evolution codetermine the window of opportunity for establishment. Our results also suggest that local populations should often be dominated by descendants of just a few early colonist lineages and that landscape genetic structure should often reflect the legacy of colonization history. © 2021 The University of Chicago.","Evolution-mediated priority effects; Evolutionary population dynamics; Monopolization; Rapid local adaptation; Transient dynamics","detection method; genetic structure; immigrant; intraspecific competition; local adaptation; resident population; acclimatization; adaptation; ecosystem; evolution; human; migrant; population dynamics; Acclimatization; Adaptation, Physiological; Biological Evolution; Ecosystem; Emigrants and Immigrants; Humans; Population Dynamics",Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus

While hierarchical Amova revealed significant heterogeneity within and between the Atlantic and Gulf, pairwise comparisons between samples within ocean basins demonstrated that all significant heterogeneity occurred within the Gulf. The distribution of Tajima's D estimated at a genome-wide scale differed significantly from equilibrium in all estuaries, with more negative values occurring in the Gulf. Components of genomic variation were significantly associated with environmental variables describing individual estuaries, and environment explained a larger component of variation than spatial proximity.

Gila Trout (Oncorhynchus gilae) is a threatened species found in the Southwestern United States, and is managed to preserve relict populations (i.e., lineages) distributed across a fragmented landscape. We evaluated genomic variation within and among remaining lineages of Gila Trout using RADseq to assess how drift and selection have structured populations using neutral and outlier loci. We also examined whether a signature of hybridization was evident in relict populations. Gila Trout lineages were significantly differentiated from one another and were characterized by low effective population sizes. However, most lineages maintained genomic diversity and are potentially adapted to local conditions. Hybridization with non-native Rainbow Trout (O. mykiss) was not detected in any lineage. All lineages have experienced population bottlenecks associated with mortality from drought and severe wildfires. Current management strategies should be reevaluated and adapted to better account for long-term effects of climate change. Specifically, we suggest reconnecting some populations via dendritic stream networks to facilitate natural dispersal in a metapopulation context. This would allow natural genetic mixing on the landscape and potentially increase adaptive potential. Furthermore, genetic rescue should be implemented to preserve integrity of the unique Spruce Creek lineage that is currently compromised by extremely low diversity. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Climate change; Genetic drift; Metapopulations; Natural selection; RADseq; Trout","conservation genetics; effective population size; genetic drift; genomics; habitat fragmentation; hybridization; isolated population; local adaptation; metapopulation; population genetics; relict species; salmonid; Colorado; Spruce Creek [Colorado]; United States; Oncorhynchus gilae; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Salmonidae",Article,"",Scopus

How genetically limited founder populations give rise to the striking phenotypic and ecological diversity characteristic of adaptive radiations is a paradox of evolutionary biology. We conducted an evolutionary genomics analysis of genus Metrosideros, a landscape-dominant, incipient adaptive radiation of woody plants that spans a striking range of phenotypes and environments across the Hawaiian Islands. Using nanopore-sequencing, we created a chromosome-level genome assembly for Metrosideros polymorpha var. incana and analyzed whole-genome sequences of 131 individuals from 11 taxa sampled across the islands. Demographic modeling and population genomics analyses suggested that Hawaiian Metrosideros originated from a single colonization event and subsequently spread across the archipelago following the formation of new islands. The evolutionary history of Hawaiian Metrosideros shows evidence of extensive reticulation associated with significant sharing of ancestral variation between taxa and secondarily with admixture. Taking advantage of the highly contiguous genome assembly, we investigated the genomic architecture underlying the adaptive radiation and discovered that divergent selection drove the formation of differentiation outliers in paired taxa representing early stages of speciation/divergence. Analysis of the evolutionary origins of the outlier single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showed enrichment for ancestral variations under divergent selection.

The long history of domestication and the presence of diverse agroecologies in Ethiopia create unique opportunities to study the effect of environmental selective pressures. Species distribution models (SDMs) and Phenotypic distribution models (PDMs) can be applied to investigate the relationship between environmental variation and phenotypic differentiation in wild animals and domestic populations. In the present study we used SDMs and PDMs to detect environmental variables related with habitat suitability and phenotypic differentiation among nondescript Ethiopian indigenous chicken populations. 34 environmental variables (climatic, soil, and vegetation) and 19 quantitative traits were analyzed for 513 adult chickens from 26 populations. To have high variation in the dataset for phenotypic and ecological parameters, animals were sampled from four spatial gradients (each represented by six to seven populations), located in different climatic zones and geographies. Three different ecotypes are proposed based on correlation test between habitat suitability maps and phenotypic clustering of sample populations. These specific ecotypes show phenotypic differentiation, likely in response to environmental selective pressures. Nine environmental variables with the highest contribution to habitat suitability are identified. The relationship between quantitative traits and a few of the environmental variables associated with habitat suitability is non-linear. Our results highlight the benefits of integrating species and phenotypic distribution modeling approaches in characterization of livestock populations, delineation of suitable habitats for specific breeds, and understanding of the relationship between ecological variables and quantitative traits, and underlying evolutionary processes. © Copyright © 2021 Kebede, Komen, Dessie, Alemu, Hanotte and Bastiaansen.","breeds and ecotypes; chickens; local adaptation; niche and agroecology; phenotypic differentiation; phenotypic distribution models (PDMs); poultry genetics and breeding; species distribution models (SDMs)","adult; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; breed; breeding; chicken; ecotype; female; geography; habitat; local adaptation; male; nonhuman; population differentiation; poultry; quantitative analysis; quantitative trait; soil; species distribution; vegetation",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

We investigated the global population genomics of tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier), a circumglobally distributed, apex predator displaying remarkable behavioral versatility in its diet, habitat use (near coastal, coral reef, pelagic), and individual movement patterns (spatially resident to long-distance migrations). We genotyped 242 tiger sharks from 10 globally distributed locations at more than 2000 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Although this species often conducts massive distance migrations, the data show strong genetic differentiation at both neutral (FST = 0.125-0.144) and candidate outlier loci (FST = 0.570-0.761) between western Atlantic and Indo-Pacific sharks, suggesting the potential for adaptation to the environments specific to these oceanic regions. Within these regions, there was mixed support for population differentiation between northern and southern hemispheres in the western Atlantic, and none for structure within the Indian Ocean. Notably, the results demonstrate a low level of population differentiation of tiger sharks from the remote Hawaiian archipelago compared with sharks from the Indian Ocean (FST = 0.003-0.005, P < 0.01). Given concerns about biodiversity loss and marine ecosystem impacts caused by overfishing of oceanic sharks in the midst of rapid environmental change, our results suggest it imperative that international fishery management prioritize conservation of the evolutionary potential of the highly genetically differentiated Atlantic and Indo-Pacific populations of this unique apex predator. Furthermore, we suggest targeted management attention to tiger sharks in the Hawaiian archipelago based on a precautionary biodiversity conservation perspective. © 2021 The American Genetic Association. 2021.

Historically, understanding the genetic basis of adaptation has been difficult, but increased availability of genome-wide markers facilitates studies of local adaptation in non-model organisms of conservation concern. The pygmy rabbit (Brachylagus idahoensis) is an imperiled lagomorph that relies on sagebrush for forage and cover. This reliance has led to widespread population declines following reductions in the distribution of sagebrush, leading to geographic separation between populations. In this study, we used >20,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms, genotype-environment association methods, and demographic modeling to examine neutral genetic variation and local adaptation in the pygmy rabbit in Nevada and California. We identified 308 loci as outliers, many of which had functional annotations related to metabolism of plant secondary compounds. Likewise, patterns of spatial variation in outlier loci were correlated with landscape and climatic variables including proximity to streams, sagebrush cover, and precipitation. We found that populations in the Mono Basin of California probably diverged from other Great Basin populations during late Pleistocene climate oscillations, and that this region is adaptively differentiated from other regions in the southern Great Basin despite limited gene flow and low effective population size.

Here, we establish phylogenetic and population genetic patterns in a widespread reptile to quantify the influence of historical biogeography and current environmental variation on patterns of genetic diversity. Location: Western North America. Taxon: Western terrestrial garter snake, Thamnophis elegans. Methods: We used double-digest RADseq to estimate phylogenetic relationships and characterize population genetic structure across the three widespread subspecies of T. elegans: T. e. vagrans (wandering garter snake), T. e. elegans (mountain garter snake) and T. e. terrestris (coast garter snake). We assessed patterns of dispersal and vicariance across biogeographic regions using ancestral area reconstruction (AAR) and deviations from isolation-by-distance across the landscape using estimated effective migration surfaces (EEMS). We identified environmental variables potentially shaping local adaptation in regional lineages using genetic-environment association (GEA) analyses. Results: We recovered three well-differentiated genetic groups that correspond to the three subspecies. AAR analyses inferred the eastern Cascade Range as the ancestral area, with dispersal to both the east and west across western North America. Populations of T. e. elegans displayed a latitudinal gradient in genetic variation across the Sierra Nevada and northern California, while populations of T. e. terrestris show discrete genetic breaks consistent with well-known biogeographic barriers. Lastly, GEA analyses identified allele frequency shifts at loci associated with a common set of environmental variables in both T. e. elegans and T. e. terrestris. Main Conclusion: T. elegans is composed of distinct evolutionary lineages, each with its own geographic range and history of diversification. T. e. elegans and T. e. terrestris show unique patterns of diversification as populations dispersed from east to west and while adapting to the new environments they colonized.

Furthermore, 63 SNPs are thought to be associated with different sea temperatures. Based on the 63 SNPs, it is hypothesised that the long-term temperature differences may contribute to the variation of genes associated with multiple biological functions, such as material metabolism, cytoskeleton, cellular processes, inflammatory response and hormonal regulation.

A previous phylogenetic study using partial mitochondrial sequences suggested that COTS had diverged into four distinct species, but a nuclear genome-based analysis to confirm this was not conducted. To address this, COTS species nuclear genome sequences were analysed here, sequencing Northern Indian Ocean (NIO) and Red Sea (RS) species genomes for the first time, followed by a comparative analysis with the Pacific Ocean (PO) species. Phylogenetic analysis and ADMIXTURE analysis revealed clear divergences between the three COTS species. Furthermore, within the PO species, the phylogenetic position of the Hawaiian sample was further away from the other Pacific-derived samples than expected based on the mitochondrial data, suggesting that it may be a PO subspecies. The pairwise sequentially Markovian coalescent model showed that the trajectories of the population size diverged by region during the Mid-Pleistocene transition when the sea-level was dramatically decreased, strongly suggesting that the three COTS species experienced allopatric speciation. Analysis of the orthologues indicated that there were remarkable genes with species-specific positive selection in the genomes of the PO and RS species, which suggested that there may be local adaptations in the COTS species. © 2021 The Author(s).

In this study, we infer the genomic structure of Pitcairnia lanuginosa, a widespread herbaceous perennial plant with a patchy distribution. We sampled populations in the Brazilian Cerrado and the Central Andean Yungas and discovered and genotyped SNP markers using double-digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing. In addition, we analyzed ecophysiological traits obtained from a common garden experiment and compared patterns of phenotypic and genetic divergence (PST–FST comparisons) in a subset of populations from the Cerrado. Our results from molecular analyses pointed to extremely low genetic diversity and a remarkable population differentiation, supporting a major role of genetic drift. Approximately 0.3% of genotyped SNPs were flagged as differentiation outliers by at least two distinct methods, and Bayesian generalized linear mixed models revealed a signature of isolation by environment in addition to isolation by distance for high-differentiation outlier SNPs among the Cerrado populations. PST–FST comparisons suggested divergent selection on two ecophysiological traits linked to drought tolerance. We showed that these traits vary among populations, although without any particular macro-spatial pattern, suggesting local adaptation to differences in micro-habitats. Our study shows that selection might be a relevant force, particularly for traits involved in drought stress, even for populations experiencing strong drift, which improves our knowledge on eco-evolutionary processes acting on non-continuously distributed species. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Genetics Society.",,"angiosperm; cerrado; ecophysiology; genomics; geographical distribution; herb; local adaptation; patch use; phenotype; Brazil; Pitcairnia; acclimatization; adaptation; Bayes theorem; genetic drift; genetic selection; genetic variation; genetics; population genetics; Acclimatization; Adaptation, Physiological; Bayes Theorem; Genetic Drift; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Selection, Genetic",Article,"",Scopus

Among bony fishes, sperm are adapted to function in a narrow salinity range. A notable exception is the family Gobiidae, where several species reproduce across a wide salinity range. The family also contains several wide-spread invasive species. To better understand how these fishes tolerate such varying conditions, we measured sperm performance in relation to salinity from a freshwater and a brackish population within their ancestral Ponto-Caspian region of the round goby, Neogobius melanostomus. These two ancestral populations were then compared to nine additional invaded sites across northern Europe, both in terms of their sperm traits and by using genomic SNP markers. Our results show clear patterns of ancestral adaptations to freshwater and brackish salinities in their sperm performance. Population genomic analyses show that the ancestral ecotypes have generally established themselves in environments that fit their sperm adaptations. Sites close to ports with intense shipping show that both outbreeding and admixture can affect the sperm performance of a population in a given salinity. Rapid adaptation to local conditions is also supported at some sites. Historical and contemporary evolution in the traits of the round goby sperm cells is tightly linked to the population and seascape genomics as well as biogeographic processes in these invasive fishes. Since the risk of a population establishing in an area is related to the genotype by environment match, port connectivity and the ancestry of the round goby population can likely be useful for predicting the species spread. © 2021 by the authors.

Arctic Char (Salvelinus alpinus) is an anadromous salmonid and the most harvested fish species by Inuit people, including in Nunavik (Québec, Canada), one of the most recently deglaciated regions in the world. Unlike many other anadromous salmonids, Arctic Char occupy coastal habitats near their natal rivers during their short marine phase restricted to the summer ice-free period. Our main objective was to document putatively neutral and adaptive genomic variation in anadromous Arctic Char populations from Nunavik and bordering regions to inform local fisheries management. We used genotyping by sequencing (GBS) to genotype 18,112 filtered single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in 650 individuals from 23 sampling locations along >2000 km of coastline. Our results reveal a hierarchical genetic structure, whereby neighboring hydrographic systems harbor distinct populations grouped by major oceanographic basins: Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Ungava Bay, and Labrador Sea. We found genetic diversity and differentiation to be consistent both with the expected postglacial recolonization history and with patterns of isolation-by-distance reflecting contemporary gene flow. Results from three gene–environment association methods supported the hypothesis of local adaptation to both freshwater and marine environments (strongest associations with sea surface and air temperatures during summer and salinity). Our results support a fisheries management strategy at a regional scale, and other implications for hatchery projects and adaptation to climate change are discussed. © 2021 The Authors.

While theory predicts how and when populations at range margins are likely to undergo local adaptation, empirical evidence testing these models remains sparse. Here, we address this knowledge gap by investigating the relationship between selection, gene flow and genetic drift in the yellowtail clownfish, Amphiprion clarkii, from the core to the northern periphery of the species range. Analyses reveal low genetic diversity at the range edge, gene flow from the core to the edge and genomic signatures of local adaptation at 56 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 25 candidate genes, most of which are significantly correlated with minimum annual sea surface temperature. Several of these candidate genes play a role in functions that are upregulated during cold stress, including protein turnover, metabolism and translation.

When climate changes faster than species can spread, the climate experienced at species’ expanding range edges may ameliorate as conditions become increasingly similar to those of the range core. When this boosts spe-cies’ growth rates, their spread accelerates. Here, we use simulations of a spreading population with an annual life history to explore how climatic amelioration interacts with dispersal evolution and local adaptation to determine the dynamics of spread. We found that depending on the timing of dispersal evolution, spread velocity can show contrasting trajectories, sometimes transiently exceeding the climate velocity before decelerating. Climatic amelioration can also accelerate the spread of populations composed of genotypes best adapted to local climatic conditions, but the exact dynamics depends on the pattern of climatic adaptation. We conclude that failing to account for demographic variation across climatic gradients can lead to erroneous conclusions about species’ capacity to spatially track suitable climate. © 2021 by The University of Chicago.","Climate gradient; Demography; Ecotypes; Migration lag; Population spread; Range shifts","acceleration; climate change; climate conditions; demography; dispersal; growth rate; life history; local adaptation; population growth; acclimatization; adaptation; climate change; ecosystem; evolution; population dynamics; Acclimatization; Adaptation, Physiological; Biological Evolution; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Population Dynamics",Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus

This is a major concern given the expected cascade effects on ecosystem services, such as pollination. Understanding the patterns and drivers of changes in the distribution and abundance of species in our rapidly changing environment is therefore urgent. Cases of species showing trends that run counter to general population declines, especially when they deliver key ecosystem services, are especially interesting. The tree bumblebee (Bombus hypnorum), which belongs to a globally important group of pollinators, has substantially expanded its range in recent years in direct contrast to many other species within this group. Here we reconstructed the likely pattern of colonization of the UK based on RAD-seq population genomic data combined with Bayesian population modelling. This RAD-seq approach also enabled an analysis of genomic regions potentially under selection. We report a complex and dynamic colonization pattern that is most likely ongoing. Current evidence suggests that either a shift in its migration potential, and/or adaptive genomic changes have contributed to the recent range expansion of B. hypnorum. Genomic areas of potential adaptive significance included genes involved in regulation of transcription and gene expression, circadian rhythms and innate immunity.

At the genetic level, we are beginning to appreciate that the re-use of the same genes in adaptation occurs through different mechanisms and can be constrained by underlying trait architectures and demographic characteristics of natural populations. Here, we explore these processes in naturally adapted high- (HP) and low-predation (LP) populations of the Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulata. As a model for phenotypic change this system provided some of the earliest evidence of rapid and repeatable evolution in vertebrates; the genetic basis of which has yet to be studied at the whole-genome level. We collected whole-genome sequencing data from ten populations (176 individuals) representing five independent HP-LP river pairs across the three main drainages in Northern Trinidad. We evaluate population structure, uncovering several LP bottlenecks and variable between-river introgression that can lead to constraints on the sharing of adaptive variation between populations. Consequently, we found limited selection on common genes or loci across all drainages. Using a pathway type analysis, however, we find evidence of repeated selection on different genes involved in cadherin signaling. Finally, we found a large repeatedly selected haplotype on chromosome 20 in three rivers from the same drainage. Taken together, despite limited sharing of adaptive variation among rivers, we found evidence of convergent evolution associated with HP-LP environments in pathways across divergent drainages and at a previously unreported candidate haplotype within a drainage. © 2021 Whiting et al.

Sebastes mentella displays a particular life-history as livebearers, for which existence of multiple ecotypes has been suspected to complicate the genetic population structure of the species. Double digest restriction-site associated DNA was used to investigate genetic population structure in S. mentella and to scan for evidence of selection. In total, 42,288 SNPs were detected in 277 fish, and 1,943 neutral and 97 tentatively adaptive loci were selected following stringent filtration. Unprecedented levels of genetic differentiation were found among the previously defined ‘shallow pelagic’, ‘deep pelagic’ and ‘demersal slope’ ecotypes, with overall mean FST = 0.05 and 0.24 in neutral and outlier SNPs, respectively. Bayesian computation estimated a concurrent and historical divergence among these three ecotypes and evidence of local adaptation was found in the S. mentella genome. Overall, these findings imply that the depth-defined habitat divergence of S. mentella has led to reproductive isolation and possibly adaptive radiation among these ecotypes. Additional sub-structuring was detected within the ‘shallow’ and ‘deep’ pelagic ecotypes. Population assignment of individual fish showed more than 94% agreement between results based on SNP and previously generated microsatellite data, but the SNP data provided a lower estimate of hybridization among the ecotypes than that by microsatellite data. We identified a SNP panel with only 21 loci to discriminate populations in mixed samples based on a machine-learning algorithm. This first SNP based investigation clarifies the population structure of S. mentella, and provides novel and high-resolution genomic tools for future investigations. The insights and tools provided here can readily be incorporated into the management of S. mentella and serve as a template for other exploited marine species exhibiting similar complex life history traits.

Carex buxbaumii and C. hartmaniorum are sister species of the clade Papilliferae within the monophyletic section Racemosae. An unambiguous identification of these species is relatively difficult due to the interspecific continuum of some morphological characters as well as the intraspecific variability. The study was aimed at determining the range of variability, both morphological and genetic, within and between these two closely related and similar species. Methods. The sedges were collected during botanical expeditions to Armenia, Estonia, the Netherlands, and Poland. The morphological separation of the two species and their populations was tested using the Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA). The genetic variability of the 19 Carex populations was assessed in the presence of eight Inter Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) primers. Results. Results of the study indicate a considerable genetic affinity between the two sedge species (mean Si = 0.619). However, the populations of C. hartmaniorum are, morphologically and genetically, more homogenous than the populations of C. buxbaumii. Compared to C. hartmaniorum, C. buxbaumii usually has wider leaf blades, a shorter inflorescence, a lower number of spikes which are shorter, but wider, and longer bracts and utricles. The AMOVA showed a larger variation between the populations of C. buxbaumii, representing 25.65% of the total variation in the taxon. Two populations of C. buxbaumii (from Poland and Estonia) are separated from the remaining populations, both genetically and morphologically; their individuals show shorter utricles and glumes, compared to the typical specimens of C. buxbaumii, and correspond with the morphology of putative infraspecific taxa described by Cajander (var. brevisquamosa and var. confusa). Conclusions. The taxonomic status of the putative infraspecific taxa within C. buxbaumii requires further studies throughout the distribution range of C. buxbaumii, addressing habitats, morphology and genetics (including a chromosome count or a combination of different genetic methods), particularly as the variability in C. buxbaumii may be associated with the species’ polyploid origin. © 2021 Więcław et al.","Discriminant function analysis; Genetic affinity; Intra- and interpopulation variability; ISSR polymorphism; Phenotypic plasticity; Racemosae","genomic DNA; nzydna ladder; Article; biogeography; bract; Carex buxbaumii; Carex hartmaniorum; chromosome; controlled study; Cyperaceae; discriminant analysis; DNA extraction; DNA isolation; gene frequency; genetic polymorphism; genetic variability; geographic distribution; glume; habitat; inflorescence; inter simple sequence repeat; leaf lamina; local adaptation; microscopy; nomenclature; nonhuman; phenotype; phylogenetic tree; phylogeny; plant genetics; plant leaf; plant structures; polyploidy; population structure; principal component analysis; spike; taxon; taxonomy; utricle",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Comparisons among extant desert-adapted species can highlight parallel or convergent patterns of genome evolution through the identification of shared signatures of selection. We generate a chromosome-level genome assembly for the canyon mouse (Peromyscus crinitus) and test for a signature of parallel evolution by comparing signatures of selective sweeps across population-level genomic resequencing data from another congeneric desert specialist (Peromyscus eremicus) and a widely distributed habitat generalist (Peromyscus maniculatus), that may be locally adapted to arid conditions. We identify few shared candidate loci involved in desert adaptation and do not find support for a shared pattern of parallel evolution. Instead, we hypothesize divergent molecular mechanisms of desert adaptation among deer mice, potentially tied to species-specific historical demography, which may limit or enhance adaptation. We identify a number of candidate loci experiencing selective sweeps in the P. crinitus genome that are implicated in osmoregulation (Trypsin, Prostasin) and metabolic tuning (Kallikrein, eIF2-alpha kinase GCN2, APPL1/2), which may be important for accommodating hot and dry environmental conditions. © The American Genetic Association. 2021.","Dehydration; Desert; Parallel evolution; Peromyscus; Thermoregulation","genomic DNA; initiation factor 2alpha; kallikrein; prostasin; trypsin; adaptation; Article; benchmarking; chromosome size; comparative genomics; desert; desertification; DNA flanking region; gene sequence; genome; genome size; maximum likelihood method; molecular evolution; multidimensional scaling; nonhuman; osmoregulation; Peromyscus; Peromyscus crinitus; Peromyscus eremicus; Peromyscus maniculatus; population genomics; selective sweep; species differentiation; thermoregulation; whole genome sequencing; adaptation; animal; climate; DNA sequence; genetics; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Climate; Genome; Peromyscus; Sequence Analysis, DNA",Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus

Local adaptation inferred from genotype-environment associations may show different genomic patterns depending on the spatial scale of sampling, due to differences in the slope of environmental gradients and the level of gene flow. We compared signatures of local adaptation across the genome of mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans) at two spatial scales: A species-wide data set and a topographically-complex subregional data set. We genotyped 367 individual trees at over 3700 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), quantified patterns of spatial genetic structure among populations, and used two analytical methods to identify loci associated with at least one of three environmental variables at each spatial scale. Together, the analyses identified 549 potentially adaptive SNPs at the subregion scale, and 435 SNPs at the range-wide scale. A total of 39 genic or near-genic SNPs, associated with 28 genes, were identified at both spatial scales, although no SNP was identified by both methods at both scales. We observed that nongenic regions had significantly higher homozygote excess than genic regions, possibly due to selective elimination of inbred genotypes during stand development. Our results suggest that strong environmental selection occurs in mountain ash, and that the identification of putatively adaptive loci can differ substantially depending on the spatial scale of analyses.

The heritability (h2) of selected traits has long been known to affect evolutionary and demographic responses to environmental change. However, effects of the genetic architecture underlying the h2 of a selected trait on population responses to selection are less well understood. We use deterministic models and stochastic simulations to show that the genetic architecture underlying h2 can dramatically affect population viability during environmental change. Polygenic trait architectures (many loci, each with a small phenotypic effect) conferred higher population viability than genetic architectures with the same initial h2 and large-effect loci under a wide range of scenarios. Population viability also depended strongly on the initial frequency of large-effect beneficial alleles, with moderately low initial allele frequencies conferring higher viability than rare or already-frequent large-effect alleles. Greater population viability associated with polygenic architectures appears to be due to higher short-term evolutionary potential compared with architectures with large-effect loci. These results suggest that integrating information on the trait genetic architecture into quantitative genetic and population viability analysis will substantially improve our understanding and prediction of evolutionary and demographic responses following environmental change. © 2021 by The University of Chicago.","Adaptation; Conservation genomics; Extinction; Natural selection; Population dynamics; Quantitative genetics","biodiversity; environmental change; evolutionary biology; fitness; genetic structure; heritability; population viability analysis; allele; biodiversity; biological model; climate change; computer simulation; evolution; gene frequency; genetic selection; multifactorial inheritance; phenotype; reproductive fitness; Alleles; Biodiversity; Biological Evolution; Climate Change; Computer Simulation; Gene Frequency; Genetic Fitness; Models, Genetic; Multifactorial Inheritance; Phenotype; Selection, Genetic",Article,"",Scopus

Although increasing evidence suggests that adaptive evolution could contribute to organisms’ adaptation to varied environments, there remain knowledge gaps regarding how environments influence genomic variation in invaded habitats and genetic bases underlying local adaptation for most marine invaders. Here, we performed restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) to assess population genetic diversity and further investigate genomic signatures of local adaptation in the marine invasive ascidian, Molgula manhattensis. We revealed that most invasive populations exhibited significant genetic differentiation, low recent gene flow, and no signal of significant population bottleneck. Based on three genome scan approaches, we identified 109 candidate loci potentially under environmental selection. Redundancy analysis and variance partitioning analysis suggest that local environmental factors, particularly the salinity-related variables, represent crucial evolutionary forces in driving adaptive divergence. Using the newly developed transcriptome as a reference, 14 functional genes were finally obtained with potential roles in salinity adaptation, including SLC5A1 and SLC9C1 genes from the solute carrier gene (SLC) superfamily.

Physical tagging data suggest that Albacore from the North and South Pacific Ocean are separate stocks, but results from previous genetic studies did not support this two stock hypothesis. In addition, observed biological differences among juveniles suggest that there may be population substructure in the North Pacific. We used double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing to assess population structure among 308 Albacore caught in 12 sample areas across the Pacific Ocean (10 North, 2 South). Since Albacore are highly migratory and spawning areas are unknown, sample groups were not assumed to be equivalent to populations and the genetic data were analyzed iteratively. We tested for putatively adaptive differences among groups and for genetic variation associated with sex. Results indicated that Albacore in the North and South Pacific can be distinguished using 84 putatively adaptive loci, but not using the remaining 12,788 presumed neutral sites. However, two individuals likely represent F1 hybrids between the North and South Pacific populations, and 43 Albacore potentially exhibit lower degrees of mixed ancestry. In addition, four or five cross-hemisphere migrants were potentially identified. No genetic evidence was found for population substructure within the North Pacific, and no loci appeared to distinguish males from females. Potential functions for the putatively adaptive loci were identified, but an annotated Albacore genome is required for further exploration.

However, if genetic variation is limited, the evolution of similar locally adapted traits may be restricted to genetically different and potentially less optimal solutions or prevented from happening altogether. Using a quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping approach, we identified the genomic regions responsible for the repeated pelvic reduction (PR) in three crosses between nine-spined stickleback populations expressing full and reduced pelvic structures. In one cross, PR mapped to linkage group 7 (LG7) containing the gene Pitx1, known to control pelvic reduction also in the three-spined stickleback. In the two other crosses, PR was polygenic and attributed to 10 novel QTL, of which 90% were unique to specific crosses. When screening the genomes from 27 different populations for deletions in the Pitx1 regulatory element, these were only found in the population in which PR mapped to LG7, even though the morphological data indicated large-effect QTL for PR in several other populations as well.

The complex exhibits a wide range of variation in developmental life history strategies, including populations and individuals that undergo metamorphosis; those able to forego metamorphosis and retain a larval, aquatic lifestyle (i.e., paedomorphosis); and those that do both. The evolution of a paedomorphic life history state is thought to lead to increased population genetic differentiation and ultimately reproductive isolation and speciation, but the degree to which it has shaped population- and species-level divergence is poorly understood. Using a large multilocus dataset from hundreds of samples across North America, we identified genetic clusters across the geographic range of the tiger salamander complex. These clusters often contain a mixture of paedomorphic and metamorphic taxa, indicating that geographic isolation has played a larger role in lineage divergence than paedomorphosis in this system. This conclusion is bolstered by geography-informed analyses indicating no effect of life history strategy on population genetic differentiation and by model-based population genetic analyses demonstrating gene flow between adjacent metamorphic and paedomorphic populations. This fine-scale genetic perspective on life history variation establishes a framework for understanding how plasticity, local adaptation, and gene flow contribute to lineage divergence. Many members of the tiger salamander complex are endangered, and the Mexican axolotl is an important model system in regenerative and biomedical research. Our results chart a course for more informed use of these taxa in experimental, ecological, and conservation research. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

Herein, we take the critically endangered Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus) that has both a low dispersal ability and distinct population divergence in different regions as an example. Basin-scale models that represent different populations in the Huanghe River Basin (HRB), the Yangtze River Basin (YRB), and the Pearl River Basin (PRB) were established using ensemble species distribution models. The species ranges under the future human population density (HPD) and climate change were predicted, and the range loss was evaluated for local basins in 2050 and 2070. Our results showed that the predominant factors affecting species distributions differed among basins, and the responses of the species occurrence to HPD and climate factors were distinctly different from northern to southern basins. Future HPD changes would be the most influential factor that engenders negative impacts on the species distribution in all three basins, especially in the HRB. Climate change will likely be less prominent in decreasing the species range, excluding in the YRB and PRB under the highest-emissions scenario in 2050. Overall, the high-emissions scenario would more significantly aggravate the negative impacts produced by HPD change in both 2050 and 2070, with maximum losses of species ranges in the HRB, YRB, and PRB of 83.4%, 60.0%, and 53.5%, respectively, under the scenarios of the combined impacts of HPD and climate changes. We proposed adapted conservation policies to effectively protect the habitat of this critically endangered animal in different basins based on the outcomes.

However, the genetic architecture underlying these adaptive changes is still poorly understood. Using population genomic approaches, we investigated the genomic architecture that underlies rapid parallel adaptation of Coilia nasus to fresh water by comparing four freshwater-resident populations with their ancestral anadromous population. Linkage disequilibrium network analysis and population genetic analyses revealed two putative large chromosome inversions on LG6 and LG22, which were enriched for outlier loci and exhibited parallel association with freshwater adaptation. Drastic frequency shifts and elevated genetic differentiation were observed for the two chromosome inversions among populations, suggesting that both inversions would undergo divergent selection between anadromous and resident ecotypes. Enrichment analysis of genes within chromosome inversions showed significant enrichment of genes involved in metabolic process, immunoregulation, growth, maturation, osmoregulation, and so forth, which probably underlay differences in morphology, physiology and behavior between the anadromous and freshwater-resident forms. The availability of beneficial standing genetic variation, large optimum shift between marine and freshwater habitats, and high efficiency of selection with large population size could lead to the observed rapid parallel adaptive genomic change. We propose that chromosomal inversions might have played an important role during the evolution of rapid parallel ecological divergence in the face of environmental heterogeneity in C. nasus. Our study provides insights into the genomic basis of rapid adaptation of complex traits in novel habitats and highlights the importance of structural genomic variants in analyses of ecological adaptation. © The Author(s) 2020.

UV irradiation is the most important environmental genotoxic agent. Thus, how elevated UV irradiation may influence human health and ecosystems has generated wide concern in the scientific community, as well as with policy makers and the public in general. In this study, we investigated patterns and mechanisms of UV adaptation in natural ecosystems by studying a gene-specific variation in the potato late blight pathogen, Phytophthora infestans. We compared the sequence characteristics of radiation sensitive 23 (RAD23), a gene involved in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway and UV tolerance, in P. infestans isolates sampled from various altitudes. We found that lower genetic variation in the RAD23 gene was caused by natural selection. The hypothesis that UV irradiation drives this selection was supported by strong correlations between the genomic characteristics and altitudinal origin (historic UV irradiation) of the RAD23 sequences with UV tolerance of the P. infestans isolates. These results indicate that the RAD23 gene plays an important role in the adaptation of P. infestans to UV stress. We also found that different climatic factors could work synergistically to determine the evolutionary adaptation of species, making the influence of climate change on ecological functions and resilience more difficult to predict. Future attention should aim at understanding the collective impact generated by simultaneous change in several climate factors on species adaptation and ecological sustainability, using state of the art technologies such as experimental evolution, genomewide scanning, and proteomics. © 2021 by the authors.

Among those, copy number variants (CNVs), including duplicated genomic regions and transposable elements (TEs), may contribute to local adaptation and/or reproductive isolation among divergent populations. Those mechanisms suppose that CNVs could be used to infer neutral and/or adaptive population genetic structure, whose study has been restricted to microsatellites, mitochondrial DNA and Amplified fragment length polymorphism markers in the past and more recently the use of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Taking advantage of recent developments allowing CNV analysis from RAD-seq data, we investigated how variation in fitness-related traits, local environmental conditions and demographic history are associated with CNVs, and how subsequent copy number variation drives population genetic structure in a marine fish, the capelin (Mallotus villosus). We collected 1538 DNA samples from 35 sampling sites in the north Atlantic Ocean and identified 6620 putative CNVs. We found associations between CNVs and the gonadosomatic index, suggesting that six duplicated regions could affect female fitness by modulating oocyte production. We also detected 105 CNV candidates associated with water temperature, among which 20% corresponded to genomic regions located within the sequence of protein-coding genes, suggesting local adaptation to cold water by means of gene sequence amplification. We also identified 175 CNVs associated with the divergence of three previously defined parapatric glacial lineages, of which 24% were located within protein-coding genes, making those loci potential candidates for reproductive isolation. Lastly, our analyses unveiled a hierarchical, complex CNV population structure determined by temperature and local geography, which was in stark contrast to that inferred based on SNPs in a previous study. Our findings underline the complementarity of those two types of genomic variation in population genomics studies. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","copy number variants; fish; local adaptation; population genetic structure; reproductive isolation; structural variants; transposable elements","amplified fragment length polymorphism; animal; Atlantic Ocean; copy number variation; demography; female; genetics; genome; single nucleotide polymorphism; Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysis; Animals; Atlantic Ocean; Demography; DNA Copy Number Variations; Female; Genome; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

We tested whether using genome-wide and putatively adaptive genetic variation give similar prioritization results. We identified adaptive loci via their association with either environmental factors or phenotypic traits using two genomic data sets: yellow warblers (Setophaga petechia) across North America and lodgepole pines (Pinus contorta) in western Canada. We measured pairwise differentiation among populations using a principal components analysis and used a phylogenetic approach (NeighborNet networks) coupled with a measure of evolutionary distinctiveness (Shapley value) to attribute a priority rank to each population. Overall, we found that prioritization rankings using adaptive variation alone were not significantly divergent from rankings based on genome-wide genetic variation. Our testing framework might be of immediate use to conservation practitioners collecting next-generation sequencing data, and we call for further investigation in other species.

The observed genetic pattern reflects a scenario of isolation by environment: FST comparisons showed a higher degree of genetic differentiation between the two Cypriot populations that are separated by only 11 km than between these two Levantine populations and the Aegean population in Greece, which are separated by 1300 km. We hypothesize that local-scale oceanographic factors influenced the dispersal of planulae between the geographically close populations, playing a crucial role in the genetic structure of this coastal coral. Yet, despite being characterized as a species with limited dispersal and high self-recruitment, large-scale migration does eventually occur as first-generation migrants were identified between the most distant populations. In line with previous findings of reproductive plasticity in C. caespitosa, we also found localized differences in reproduction mode (sexual vs. asexual) within a geographically limited context. Several individuals were identified as clones, indicating the predominance of asexual reproduction in one of the Cypriot populations. We interpret this predominance either as a direct response to or as an indirect consequence of perturbations suffered by this C. caespitosa population. These perturbations are caused by unfavourable environmental conditions that threatened local survival, in particular water temperature changes and windstorm swells. Asexual reproduction may be a mechanism used by C. caespitosa to counteract mortality events and recolonize devastated areas, and likely accounts for the occasional high levels of clonality and low levels of genetic diversity. Local adaptations such as these should therefore be considered in conservation and management strategies to maintain and preserve the gene pool of this endangered species. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Asexual reproduction; Clones; Dispersion; Endangered coral; Genetic connectivity; Population structure","asexual reproduction; coral; crustacean; endangered species; genetic differentiation; genetic structure; local adaptation; mortality; water temperature; Greece; Mediterranean Sea; Cladocora caespitosa",Review,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus

Hence, climate-related disaster preparedness is now acknowledged by climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction experts. However, there is limited knowledge of communities and policy-makers on the integration of climate change adaptation (CCA) and disaster risk reduction (DRR). This paper through the lens of resilience theory presents goals towards linking coastal climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction from the case study of East London, coastal city in South Africa. This study gathered data through a semi-structured survey, aimed at defining salient public issues to improve CCA and DRR policies, public participation inclusion, and programmes. This study shows that the knowledge of CCA and DRR is relatively low in the study area, also the provision of disaster information by the local authority is quite low. Conversely, most of the respondents affirm that available disaster information is always in locally understood languages, this is important in understanding disaster early warning by local dwellers. Accordingly, in disaster information dissemination, the government should be proactive and responsive in spreading information that covers every people. Further work that respects the importance of indigenous knowledge for CCA and DRR integration is needed i.e. local participation in the framework of development endeavours, through the inclusion of indigenous people in policymaking at the sub-national, national and international levels, this would help them to participate in administrative processes that affect them; providing a resilient community, improved adaptive capacity and sustainable living.

Increased environmental changes fueled by human activities are affecting their existence, compromising natural habitats and ecosystems’ biodiversity and functioning. In this context, restoration of disturbed seagrass environments has become a worldwide priority to reverse ecosystem degradation and to recover ecosystem functionality and associated services. Despite the proven importance of genetic research to perform successful restoration projects, this aspect has often been overlooked in seagrass restoration. Here, we aimed to provide a comprehensive perspective of genetic aspects related to seagrass restoration. To this end, we first reviewed the importance of studying the genetic diversity and population structure of target seagrass populations; then, we discussed the pros and cons of different approaches used to restore and/or reinforce degraded populations. In general, the collection of genetic information and the development of connectivity maps are critical steps for any seagrass restoration activity. Traditionally, the selection of donor population preferred the use of local gene pools, thought to be the best adapted to current conditions. However, in the face of rapid ocean changes, alternative approaches such as the use of climate-adjusted or admixture genotypes might provide more sustainable options to secure the survival of restored meadows. Also, we discussed different transplantation strategies applied in seagrasses and emphasized the importance of long-term seagrass monitoring in restoration. The newly developed information on epigenetics as well as the application of assisted evolution strategies were also explored. Finally, a view of legal and ethical issues related to national and international restoration management is included, highlighting improvements and potential new directions to integrate with the genetic assessment. We concluded that a good restoration effort should incorporate: (1) a good understanding of the genetic structure of both donors and populations being restored; (2) the analysis of local environmental conditions and disturbances that affect the site to be restored; (3) the analysis of local adaptation constraints influencing the performances of donor populations and native plants; (4) the integration of distribution/connectivity maps with genetic information and environmental factors relative to the target seagrass populations; (5) the planning of long-term monitoring programs to assess the performance of the restored populations.

Yet, to what extent coexisting closely related species evolve collectively or show distinctive evolutionary responses remains a fundamental ques-tion. To address this, we studied the population genetic structure and morphological differentiation of sympatric three‐spined and nine‐spined stickleback. We conducted genotyping‐by‐sequencing and morphological trait characterisation using 24 individuals of each species from four lowland brackish water (LBW), four lowland freshwater (LFW) and three upland freshwater (UFW) sites in Belgium and the Netherlands. This combination of sites allowed us to contrast populations from isolated but environmentally similar locations (LFW vs. UFW), isolated but environmentally heterogeneous locations (LBW vs. UFW), and well‐connected but environmentally heterogenous locations (LBW vs. LFW). Overall, both species showed comparable levels of genetic diversity and neutral genetic differentiation. However, for all three spatial scales, signatures of morphological and genomic adaptive divergence were substantially stronger among populations of the three‐spined stickleback than among populations of the nine‐spined stickleback. Furthermore, most outlier SNPs in the two species were associated with local freshwater sites. The few outlier SNPs that were associated with the split between brackish water and freshwater populations were located on one linkage group in three‐spined stickleback and two linkage groups in nine‐spined stickleback. We con-clude that while both species show congruent evolutionary and genomic patterns of divergent se-lection, both species differ in the magnitude of their response to selection regardless of the geo-graphical and environmental context. © 2021 by the authors.

In aquatic environments, species might not be able to redistribute poleward or into deeper water when temperatures rise because of barriers, reduced light availability, altered water chemistry or any combination of these. How species respond to climate change may depend on physiological adaptability, but also on the population dynamics of the species. Density dependence is a ubiquitous force that governs population dynamics and regulates population growth, yet its connections to the impacts of climate change remain little known, especially in marine studies. Reductions in density below an environmental carrying capacity may cause compensatory increases in demographic parameters and population growth rate, hence masking the impacts of climate change on populations. On the other hand, climate-driven deterioration of conditions may reduce environmental carrying capacities, making compensation less likely and populations more susceptible to the effects of stochastic processes. Here we investigate the effects of climate change on Baltic blue mussels using a 17-year dataset on population density. Using a Bayesian modelling framework, we investigate the impacts of climate change, assess the magnitude and effects of density dependence, and project the likelihood of population decline by the year 2030. Our findings show negative impacts of warmer and less saline waters, both outcomes of climate change. We also show that density dependence increases the likelihood of population decline by subjecting the population to the detrimental effects of stochastic processes (i.e. low densities where random bad years can cause local extinction, negating the possibility for random good years to offset bad years). We highlight the importance of understanding, and accounting for both density dependence and climate variation when predicting the impact of climate change on keystone species, such as the Baltic blue mussel. © 2020 British Ecological Society","Bivalvia; climate change; demographic mechanism; density dependence; population projection; salinity; stochastic process; temperature","adaptation; aquatic environment; bivalve; carrying capacity; climate change; demography; density dependence; environmental factor; high temperature; keystone species; local extinction; population decline; population growth; population regulation; stochasticity; water chemistry; Bivalvia; Mytilus edulis; animal; Bayes theorem; climate change; environmental protection; Mytilus edulis; population dynamics; Animals; Bayes Theorem; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Mytilus edulis; Population Dynamics",Article,"",Scopus

Here, we investigate putative signals of selection in Australian populations of invasive common starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, and seek to understand how these have been influenced by introduction history. We used reduced representation sequencing to determine population structure, and identify Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) that are putatively under selection. We found that since their introduction into Australia, starling populations have become genetically differentiated despite the potential for high levels of dispersal, and that starlings have responded to selective pressures imposed by a wide range of environmental conditions across their geographic range. Isolation by distance appears to have played a strong role in determining genetic substructure across the starling's Australian range. Analyses of candidate SNPs that are putatively under selection indicated that aridity, precipitation and temperature may be important factors driving adaptive variation across the starling's invasive range in Australia. However, we also noted that the historic introduction regime may leave footprints on sites flagged as being under adaptive selection, and encourage critical interpretation of selection analyses in non-native populations. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","common starling; invasive species; local adaptation; population genetics; Sturnus vulgaris","animal; Australia; genetic selection; genetics; introduced species; population genetics; single nucleotide polymorphism; starling; Animals; Australia; Genetics, Population; Introduced Species; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Selection, Genetic; Starlings",Article,"",Scopus

I present the current knowledge on how the species diversity originates, and the discovery of cryptic ligninolytic fungal species. I also focus on the distribution of ligninolytic fungi, both on how individuals are locally distributed on a single substrate of dead wood and on how species are distributed at larger scales.

We tested for intraspecific phenotypic structuring by population in a common native lake-dwelling fish species across a medium-scale geographic region with considerable variation in lake types. We investigated potential lake-characteristic drivers of trophic morphology. Using geometric morphometric techniques, we quantified the head shapes of 759 adult brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) from 28 lakes and reservoirs across Scotland. Multivariate statistical analyses showed that almost all populations differed from one another. Trout from larger and deeper lakes had deeper, but shorter heads, and smaller eyes. Higher elevation lakes were associated with fish with shorter heads and jaws. Within-population shape variation also differed by population, and was positively correlated with lake surface area and depth. Trout within reservoirs differed subtly from those in natural lakes, having larger eyes, shorter jaws and greater variability. This study documents an extraordinary morphological variation between and within populations of brown trout, and demonstrates the role of the extrinsic environment in driving phenotypic structuring over a medium-scale and varied geographic area. © 2020 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2020, 131, 585-599","Brown trout; Ecosystem-size; Elevation; Morphology; Natural lake; Phenotype; Reservoir; Structuring; Trophic","elevation; local adaptation; morphometry; phenotype; population structure; sexual selection; surface area; Scotland; United Kingdom; Salmo trutta",Article,"",Scopus

We examined consecutive spawning and homing by Sakhalin taimen (Parahucho perryi), one of the least-studied iteroparous salmonids. The average consecutive return rate was 69.5%, the highest ever reported for an iteroparous salmonid. The consecutive return rates were highest for large spawners, females, and individuals with active inter-tributary movements in the preceding year. We estimated tributary-scale repeat homing rates to be 50–87%, which was significantly higher than expected by chance alone. The repeat homing rates were higher for spawners that entered tributaries with more abundant spawners in the preceding year, which is consistent with the pheromone hypothesis because the abundance of spawners in a tributary is expected to correlate to the concentration of chemical homing cues emanating from offspring in the following year. These extremely high consecutive return and homing rates likely facilitated local adaptation over evolutionary time scales and have contributed to population stability in this river system.

Here, we analyse phenotypic and genetic variation involved in the successful establishment of a marine fish (sand goby, Pomatoschistus minutus) over a steep salinity drop from 35 PSU in the North Sea (NE Atlantic) to two PSU in the inner parts of the post-glacial Baltic Sea. We first show that populations are adapted to local salinity in a key reproductive trait, the proportion of motile sperm. Thereafter, we show that genome variation at 22,190 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) shows strong differentiation among populations along the gradient. Sequences containing outlier SNPs and transcriptome sequences, mapped to a draft genome, reveal associations with genes with relevant functions for adaptation in this environment but without overall evidence of functional enrichment. The many contigs involved suggest polygenic differentiation. We trace the origin of this differentiation using demographic modelling and find the most likely scenario is that at least part of the genetic differentiation is older than the Baltic Sea and is a result of isolation of two lineages prior to the current contact over the North Sea–Baltic Sea transition zone. © 2020 The Authors.

However, it relies on two implicit assumptions: that the assembled transcriptome is an unbiased representation of the underlying expressed transcriptome, and that expression estimates from the assembly are good, if noisy approximations of the relative abundance of expressed transcripts. Using publicly available data for model organisms, we demonstrate that, across assembly algorithms and data sets, these assumptions are consistently violated. Bias exists at the nucleotide level, with genotyping error rates ranging from 30% to 83%. As a result, diversity is underestimated in transcriptome assemblies, with consistent underestimation of heterozygosity in all but the most inbred samples. Even at the gene level, expression estimates show wide deviations from map-to-reference estimates, and positive bias at lower expression levels. Standard filtering of transcriptome assemblies improves the robustness of gene expression estimates but leads to the loss of a meaningful number of protein-coding genes, including many that are highly expressed. We demonstrate a computational method, length-rescaled CPM, to partly alleviate noise and bias in expression estimates.

The tiger beetle Chaetodera laetescripta exhibits pronounced variation in elytral colour pattern among sandy habitats of different colour in the Japanese Archipelago. In this study, we performed digital image analysis with avian vision modelling to demonstrate that elytral luminance, which is attributed to proportions of elytral colour components, is fine-tuned to match local backgrounds. Field predation experiments with model beetles showed that better luminance matching resulted in a lower attack rate and corresponding lower mortality. Using restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) sequence data, we analysed the dispersal and evolution of colour pattern across geographical locations. We found that sand colour matching occurred irrespective of genetic and geographical distances between populations, suggesting that locally adapted colour patterns evolved after the colonization of these habitats. Given that beetle elytral colour patterns presumably have a quantitative genetic basis, our findings demonstrate that fine-tuning of background-matching camouflage to local habitat conditions can be attained through selection by visual predators, as predicted by the earliest proponent of natural selection. © 2020 The Author(s).","camouflage; character evolution; coloration; local adaptation","adaptation; beetle; ecomorphology; evolutionary biology; geographical variation; life history trait; natural selection; population structure; sandy soil; Cicindela laetescripta; Coleoptera; acclimatization; adaptation; animal; beetle; biological mimicry; bird; color; ecosystem; evolution; genetic selection; physiology; pigmentation; predation; shark; vision; Acclimatization; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Biological Evolution; Biological Mimicry; Birds; Coleoptera; Color; Ecosystem; Pigmentation; Predatory Behavior; Selection, Genetic; Sharks; Vision, Ocular",Article,"",Scopus

This is because the strength of natural selection is dependent on the direction and magnitude of phenotypic responses to environmental signals. Therefore, the connection between plasticity and adaptation will depend on the patterns of plasticity harbored by ancestral populations before a change in the environment. Yet few studies have directly assessed ancestral variation in plasticity and tracked phenotypic changes over time. Here we resurrected historic propagules of Daphnia spanning multiple species and lakes in Wisconsin following the invasion and proliferation of a novel predator (spiny waterflea, Bythotrephes longimanus). This approach revealed extensive genetic variation in predator-induced plasticity in ancestral populations of Daphnia. It is unlikely that the standing patterns of plasticity shielded Daphnia from selection to permit long-term coexistence with a novel predator. Instead, this variation in plasticity provided the raw materials for Bythotrephes-mediated selection to drive rapid shifts in Daphnia behavior and life history. Surprisingly, there was little evidence for the evolution of trait plasticity as genetic variation in plasticity was maintained in the face of a novel predator. Such results provide insight into the link between plasticity and adaptation and highlight the importance of quantifying genetic variation in plasticity when evaluating the drivers of evolutionary change in the wild. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

The relationships between the timing of a phenological event in a population and its environmental cue can be described by a population-level reaction norm. Variation in reaction norms along environmental gradients may either intensify the environmental effects on timing (cogradient variation) or attenuate the effects (countergradient variation). To resolve spatial and seasonal variation in species' response, we use a unique dataset of 91 taxa and 178 phenological events observed across a network of 472 monitoring sites, spread across the nations of the former Soviet Union. We show that compared to local rates of advancement of phenological events with the advancement of temperature-related cues (i.e., variation within site over years), spatial variation in reaction norms tend to accentuate responses in spring (cogradient variation) and attenuate them in autumn (countergradient variation). As a result, among-population variation in the timing of events is greater in spring and less in autumn than if all populations followed the same reaction norm regardless of location. Despite such signs of local adaptation, overall phenotypic plasticity was not sufficient for phenological events to keep exact pace with their cues-the earlier the year, the more did the timing of the phenological event lag behind the timing of the cue. Overall, these patterns suggest that differences in the spatial versus temporal reaction norms will affect species' response to climate change in opposite ways in spring and autumn. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

We explored this question in detail in the cold-tolerant kelp species Saccharina latissima, using microsatellites and double digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing ( ddRAD-seq) derived single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to analyze the genetic diversity and structure in 11 sites spanning the entire European Atlantic latitudinal range of this species. In addition, we checked for statistical correlation between genetic marker allele frequencies and three environmental proxies (sea surface temperature, salinity, and water turbidity). Our findings revealed that genetic diversity was significantly higher for the northernmost locality (Spitsbergen) compared to the southern ones (Northern Iberia), which we discuss in light of the current state of knowledge on phylogeography of S. latissima and the potential influence of the recent climatic changes on the population structure of this species. Seven SNPs and 12 microsatellite alleles were found to be significantly associated with at least one of the three environmental variables.

Developmental mode is thought to significantly influence dispersal, with direct developers expected to have much lower dispersal potential. However, this prediction can be complicated by the presence of geophysical barriers to dispersal. In this study, we use a panel of 8,020 SNPs to investigate population structure and biogeography over multiple spatial scales for a direct-developing species, the New Zealand endemic marine isopod Isocladus armatus. Because our sampling range is intersected by two well-known biogeographic barriers (the East Cape and the Cook Strait), our study provides an opportunity to understand how such barriers influence dispersal in direct developers. On a small spatial scale (20 km), gene flow between locations is extremely high, suggestive of an island model of migration. However, over larger spatial scales (600 km), populations exhibit a clear pattern of isolation-by-distance. Our results indicate that I. armatus exhibits significant migration across the hypothesized barriers and suggest that large-scale ocean currents associated with these locations do not present a barrier to dispersal. Interestingly, we find evidence of a north-south population genetic break occurring between Māhia and Wellington. While no known geophysical barrier is apparent in this area, it coincides with the location of a proposed border between bioregions. Analysis of loci under selection revealed that both isolation-by-distance and adaption may be contributing to the degree of population structure we have observed here. We conclude that developmental life history largely predicts dispersal in the intertidal isopod I. armatus. However, localized biogeographic processes can disrupt this expectation, and this may explain the potential meta-population detected in the Auckland region. © 2020 The Authors.

In this study, we used seascape genomic tools to evaluate the genetic structure of the commercially important ascidian Pyura chilensis, a species that exhibits a low larval transport potential but high anthropogenic dispersal. A recent study in this species recorded significant genetic differentiation across a transition zone around 30°S in putatively adaptive SNPs, but not in neutral ones, suggesting an important role of environmental heterogeneity in driving genetic structure. Here, we aim to understand genomic-oceanographic associations in P. chilensis along the Southeastern Pacific coast using two combined seascape genomic approaches. Using 149 individuals from five locations along the HCS, a total of 2,902 SNPs were obtained by Genotyping-By-Sequencing, of which 29–585 were putatively adaptive loci, depending on the method used for detection. In adaptive loci, spatial genetic structure was better correlated with environmental differences along the study area (mainly to Sea Surface Temperature, upwelling-associated variables and productivity) than to the geographic distance between sites. Additionally, results consistently showed the presence of two groups, located north and south of 30°S, which suggest that local adaptation processes seem to allow the maintenance of genomic differentiation and the spatial genomic structure of the species across the 30°S biogeographic transition zone of the Humboldt Current System, overriding the homogenizing effects of gene flow. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"adult; article; Ascidiacea; controlled study; female; gene flow; gene structure; genetic variability; human; human experiment; local adaptation; major clinical study; male; nonhuman; productivity; sea surface temperature; seashore; single nucleotide polymorphism; acclimatization; animal; aquatic species; Chile; environment; gene frequency; genetics; genome; genotype; Pacific Ocean; phylogeography; physiology; population genetics; Urochordata; Acclimatization; Animals; Aquatic Organisms; Chile; Environment; Gene Flow; Gene Frequency; Genetics, Population; Genome; Genotype; Pacific Ocean; Phylogeography; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Urochordata",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

Until recently, the adaptive role of structural variants (SVs) and particularly that of CNVs has been overlooked in wild populations, partly due to their challenging identification. Here, we document the usefulness of Rapture, a derived reduced-representation shotgun sequencing approach, to detect and investigate copy number variants (CNVs) alongside SNPs in American lobster (Homarus americanus) populations. We conducted a comparative study to examine the potential role of SNPs and CNVs in local adaptation by sequencing 1,141 lobsters from 21 sampling sites within the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, which experiences the highest yearly thermal variance of the Canadian marine coastal waters. Our results demonstrated that CNVs account for higher genetic differentiation than SNP markers. Contrary to SNPs, for which no significant genetic–environment association was found, 48 CNV candidates were significantly associated with the annual variance of sea surface temperature, leading to the genetic clustering of sampling locations despite their geographic separation. Altogether, we provide a strong empirical case that CNVs putatively contribute to local adaptation in marine species and unveil stronger spatial signal of population structure than SNPs. Our study provides the means to study CNVs in nonmodel species and highlights the importance of considering structural variants alongside SNPs to enhance our understanding of ecological and evolutionary processes shaping adaptive population structure. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","American lobster; copy number variants; fishery management; local adaptation; structural variants","article; coastal waters; comparative study; controlled study; fishery management; gene frequency; genetic association; genetic marker; genetic variability; Homarus americanus; local adaptation; marine species; nonhuman; population structure; sea surface temperature; shotgun sequencing; single nucleotide polymorphism",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

To evaluate the impact of early-life traits and environmental conditions on genetic structuring and adaptation, we studied two sympatric fish species in the Western Mediterranean Sea: Symphodus tinca and S. ocellatus. We followed an individual-based approach and measured early-life history traits from otolith readings, gathered information on environmental variables and obtained genome-wide markers from genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS). The two species presented contrasting population structure across the same geographic gradient, with high and significant population differentiation in S. ocellatus, mostly determined by oceanographic fronts, and low differentiation and no front effect in S. tinca. Despite their different levels of genetic differentiation, we identified in both species candidate regions for local adaptation by combining outlier analysis with environmental and phenotypic association analyses. Most candidate loci were associated to temperature and productivity in S. ocellatus and to temperature and turbulence in S. tinca suggesting that different drivers may determine genomic diversity and differentiation in each species. Globally, our study highlights that individual-based approach combining genomic, environmental and phenotypic information is key to identify signals of selection and the processes mediating them. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"article; controlled study; genetic marker; genetic variability; genomics; human; life history trait; local adaptation; Mediterranean Sea; otolith; population differentiation; population structure; productivity; animal; classification; congenic strain; DNA sequence; evolution; fish; genetics; genomics; physiology; procedures; species difference; sympatry; Animals; Animals, Congenic; Biological Evolution; Fishes; Genomics; Life History Traits; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Species Specificity; Sympatry",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Among biphasic amphibians, juveniles—which are infrequently studied but play a key role in amphibian population dynamics—are the first life stage to experience terrestrial conditions following the aquatic larval stage. To illuminate phenotypic variation that may allow juveniles to survive the physiological challenges presented by this transition, we examined respiratory surface area water loss (RSAWL) and standard metabolic rates (SMR) among juveniles reared under common larval conditions for five salamander species (Ambystoma annulatum, A. maculatum, A. opacum, A. talpoideum, and A. texanum) collected across ~ 200 km of latitude in Missouri, USA. We found that SMR described 34% of variation in RSAWL, suggesting that physiological water conservation may be limited by energetic regulation among these species, and vice versa. On average, species differed in juvenile SMR and residual values of RSAWL (corrected for body size/shape) by 0.04 mL CO2·g-1·hr-1 and 0.16, respectively, possibly because of distinct species ecologies. For example, A. annulatum had higher SMR and RSAWL compared to broadly distributed study species, potentially associated with a relatively narrow range of environmental conditions experienced across the small geographic distribution of A. annulatum. Latitude correlated negatively with temperature and precipitation, and positively with RSAWL, suggesting that variation in RSAWL may be adaptive to local conditions. We provide evidence that species differences likely have a genetic basis, reflecting selection favoring species divergence to effectively use distinct microhabitats. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Adaptation; Ambystoma; Metamorph; Physiology; Salamander","abiotic factor; amphibian; environmental factor; geographical distribution; interspecific variation; intraspecific variation; juvenile; local adaptation; metabolism; microhabitat; population dynamics; Missouri; United States; Ambystoma; Ambystoma annulatum; Amphibia; Salamandroidea; water; Ambystoma; Amphibia; animal; Caudata; human; Missouri; Ambystoma; Amphibians; Animals; Humans; Missouri; Urodela; Water",Article,"",Scopus

Here, we surveyed genetic markers in winged kelp Alaria in the Gulf of Alaska, Northeast Pacific Ocean to understand how paleoclimates may have influenced diversity in this kelp. The study included wide geographic sampling over 2800 km and large sample sizes compared to previous studies of this kelp. Mitochondrial 5′-COI (664 bp), plastid rbcL-3′ (740 bp) and 8 microsatellite markers in 16 populations resolved 5 well-defined lineages. COI-rbcL haplotypes were distributed chaotically among populations around the Gulf of Alaska. Principal Coordinates Analysis of microsatellite genotypes grouped plants largely by organellar lineage instead of geography, indicating reproductive isolation among lineages. However, microsatellite markers detected hybrids at 3 sites where lineages co-occurred. Local adaptation on various time scales may be responsible for some genetic differences between populations located along wave-energy and salinity gradients, but the chaotic pattern of variability over hundreds of kilometers is likely due to isolations in northern refugia during Pleistocene ice ages. The range of divergences between populations indicates that episodic glaciations led to the creation of new lineages, but population turnover (local extinctions and recolonizations) limited the formation of new species in the Northeastern Pacific Ocean. © 2020 The American Genetic Association.

There is an urgent need to understand the underlying mechanisms that influence the persistence of populations across a species' distribution range in the face of global warming. Ocenebra erinaceus is a marine gastropod that exhibits high intraspecific variability in maternal investment and physiological capacity during early stages, which suggests local adaptation to natal environmental conditions. In this study, reproductive traits and trans-generational adaptation were measured in two subtidal populations: one from the middle (the Solent, UK) and another towards the southern end of their geographic distribution (Arcachon, France). Local adaptation was evaluated with a transfer experiment (i.e. Arcachon females transferred to Solent thermal conditions) and trans-generational adaptation was evaluated in the thermal tolerance response of embryos exposed to temperatures between 10 and 20 °C. This study shows that both populations have similar fitness; however, there are adaptive costs to live under their natal location, resulting in trade-offs between reproductive traits. Transferred females show lower reproductive output, which suggests that females are maladapted to live under a new environment. The trans-generational experiment demonstrates contrasting thermal tolerance ranges between populations. Adaptation to local thermal conditions was observed in transferred embryos, showing poor performance and high mortalities under the new environment. Our results provide a better understanding of intraspecific differences and adaptations across a species’ distribution range and provide insights into how climate warming will impact encapsulated species exhibiting location-specific adaptation. © 2020 Elsevier LtdCapsules deposited by Arcachon females (i.e. warm temperatures) were larger and with more eggs than for Solent and transferred females. This difference in size could be explained as a combined effect of temperature and oxygen. In caenogastropods, encapsulation can be constrained by the increase of temperature and oxygen availability (Lardies and Fernández, 2002; Cancino et al., 2011). Females deposit eggs inside capsules with the same oxygen concentration that they experienced in the field, usually with values between 8 and 9 mg O2 L−1 (Cancino et al., 2011; Cumplido et al., 2011). There is minimal diffusion of oxygen through the capsule wall from the external environment (Segura et al., 2010). Therefore, the oxygen at the beginning of the development depends on the environmental temperature and oxygen saturation that the mother experienced at the time of laying. In this study, Arcachon females and their offspring experienced warmer temperatures in the field than in the Solent; thus, it can be concluded that Arcachon females allocated more resources in laying larger capsules to allow more oxygen availability per embryo which could positively impact on the embryo survival at high temperatures. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Fecundity; Gastropoda; Intraspecific differences; Local adaptation; Plasticity","Binary alloys; Economic and social effects; Geographical distribution; Global warming; Oxygen; Potassium alloys; Uranium alloys; Diffusion of oxygens; Environmental conditions; Environmental temperature; External environments; Intra-specific differences; Intraspecific variability; Oxygen concentrations; Physiological capacity; Population distribution; adaptation; fecundity; fitness; gastropod; intraspecific variation; marine ecosystem; reproductive status; survival; article; climate warming; embryo; female; fertility; France; geographic distribution; heat tolerance; local adaptation; mortality; neogastropod; nonhuman; acclimatization; adaptation; animal; greenhouse effect; phenotype; Arcachon Bay; England; France; Gironde; Nouvelle-Aquitaine; Solent; United Kingdom; Erinaceus; Gastropoda; Neogastropoda; Ocenebra; Acclimatization; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Female; France; Global Warming; Phenotype",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

This study focused on M. margaritifera from six locations within two stream systems in central and eastern Massachusetts, USA, to understand the historical impact of damming and habitat fragmentation on local population structure and genetic diversity. Approximately 300 informative single nucleotide polymorphisms were generated from 59 individuals across six geographical locations, using the restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing approach. Genotypes were also gleaned from publicly available RNA sequencing data of 23 French M. margaritifera samples. Predictions of population structure using discriminant analysis of principal components and fastStructure both indicate the existence of a single genetic population in central and eastern Massachusetts, and a clear separation from French individuals. This observation is further supported by frequency-based calculations of population genetics, which indicate near-complete admixture and a high number of migrants between Massachusetts sites. These results suggest that the effects of habitat fragmentation from damming in the past century have not radiated through the Massachusetts population of M. margaritifera, potentially because of the long lifespan and generation time of the species. However, the Massachusetts population has similar levels of genetic diversity to the endangered populations in Europe, and these factors should be considered by conservationists when creating conservation and management plans. The findings of this study suggest that populations in North America are reasonably healthy and diverse and that, as one population, the study area represents one conservation unit. This indicates that dam removal, habitat restoration, and captive breeding programmes may be viable options to increase the small population numbers and retain a substantial portion of genetic diversity without sacrificing local adaptation. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","endangered species; freshwater mussel; genetic diversity; habitat fragmentation; population genetics; RAD-seq; SNPs","biodiversity; bivalve; captive breeding; conservation management; endangered species; freshwater ecosystem; genotype; local adaptation; population genetics; snail; species conservation; stream; Massachusetts; United States; Margaritifera margaritifera",Article,"",Scopus

By contrast, straying between component stocks may bolster declining populations or allow for colonization of new habitat. To examine rates of natal philopatry and straying among western Lake Erie walleye (Sander vitreus) stocks, we used the concentration of strontium [Sr] in otolith cores to determine the natal origin of adults captured at three major spawning sites: the Sandusky (n = 62) and Maumee (n = 55) rivers and the Ohio reef complex (n = 50) during the 2012–2013 spawning seasons. Mean otolith core [Sr] was consistently and significantly higher for individuals captured in the Sandusky River than for those captured in the Maumee River or Ohio reef complex. Although logistic regression indicates that no individuals with a Maumee River or Ohio reef complex origin were captured in the Sandusky River, quadratic discriminant analysis suggests low rates of straying of fish between the Maumee and Sandusky rivers. Our results suggest little straying and high rates of natal philopatry in the Sandusky River walleye stock.

Taiwan, an island state, is deeply threatened by the multiple threats posed by climate change. However, different urban and rural areas have numerous adaptation approaches due to their differences in vulnerability. In Taipei City (urban), its biophysical vulnerability is mainly affected by flooded areas and high flood depths caused by landslides and heavy rains. Its social vulnerability is affected by economic development, high household assets, and population concentration. In Yunlin County (rural), its biophysical vulnerability is also affected by flooded areas and high flood depths caused by heavy rains. Its social vulnerability is affected by the elderly living alone, low household assets, and low healthcare. In order to propose appropriate adaptation strategies of urban and rural areas under different vulnerabilities, this study uses an overlapping method to examine the relationship between the integrated vulnerability (biophysical and social) of Taipei and Yunlin along with the ecological footprint (EF), a measurement of human demands for resources and ecological services. This study reviews the literature and uses Taiwan’s NCDR (National Science and Technology Center for Disaster Reduction) data to analyze the biophysical vulnerability and the social vulnerability and further calculate the integrated vulnerability. In this study, questionnaire surveys were conducted. In Taipei, 446 valid questionnaires were collected, while 393 were collected in Yunlin. The results show that personal EF in Taipei is higher than that in Yunlin. In the end, this study elucidates the relationship between integrated vulnerability and personal EF of Taipei and Yunlin. Four types of risk areas in urban Taipei and rural Yunlin are sorted out (high vulnerability/high EF, high vulnerability/low EF, low vulnerability/high EF, and low vulnerability/low EF).

The black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon), is widely distributed throughout the Indian and Pacific Oceans including along the western, northern and eastern coastline of Australia, where it is an important aquaculture and fishery species. Understanding the genetic structure and the influence of environmental factors leading to adaptive differences among populations of this species is important for farm genetic improvement programs and sustainable fisheries management. Results: Based on 278 individuals obtained from seven geographically disparate Australian locations, 10,624 high-quality SNP loci were used to characterize genetic diversity, population structure, genetic connectivity, and adaptive divergence. Significant population structure and differentiation were revealed among wild populations (average F ST = 0.001-0.107; p < 0.05). Eighty-nine putatively outlier SNPs were identified to be potentially associated with environmental variables by using both population differentiation (BayeScan and PCAdapt) and environmental association (redundancy analysis and latent factor mixed model) analysis methods. Clear population structure with similar spatial patterns were observed in both neutral and outlier markers with three genetically distinct groups identified (north Queensland, Northern Territory, and Western Australia). Redundancy, partial redundancy, and multiple regression on distance matrices analyses revealed that both geographical distance and environmental factors interact to generate the structure observed across Australian P. monodon populations.

In the fjords of southern Norway, 2 ecotypes of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua co-exist during their juvenile life stage. Cod of the North Sea ecotype are on average 2 cm larger than the fjord ecotype at the end of their first growing season in October, suggesting either differences in spawning time or differences in growth during the larval and early juvenile phase. We analysed 24 352 daily otolith increments from 145 cod sampled in September 2000, 2003, 2008 and 2015 at 2 locations to estimate individual hatching times and daily growth rates. There was no significant difference in hatching time between ecotypes, locations or years. Population-specific models of the effect of year, temperature and fish length on growth rates showed that the North Sea ecotype grew significantly faster than the fjord ecotype, but growth rate differences were small until the juveniles reached ~40 mm and disappeared again in juveniles larger than 110 mm. The size range (40− 110 mm) corresponds to the period following settling. This study documents how vital rates (e.g. growth rates) may change rapidly at ontogenetic transition points, leading to different phenotypic trajectories in co-existing ecotypes. It also highlights the importance of settlement as a key life-history transition that may amplify small existing differences in growth rates through positive feedback of size on competitive ability and eventually recruitment. © Inter-Research 2020","Competition; Growth; Local adaptation; Nursery; Otoliths; Temperature","body shape; coexistence; competitive ability; ecotype; fjord; gadoid; growth rate; otolith; recruitment (population dynamics); settling behavior; spawning population; Atlantic Ocean; North Sea; Norway; Gadus morhua",Article,"",Scopus

Therefore, it is imperative to characterise the main selective forces acting on ecosystems, and how these may influence the evolutionary potential of populations and species. Using a multi-model seascape genomics approach, we compare putative environmental drivers of selection in three sympatric southern African marine invertebrates with contrasting ecology and life histories: Cape urchin (Parechinus angulosus), Common shore crab (Cyclograpsus punctatus), and Granular limpet (Scutellastra granularis). Results: Using pooled (Pool-seq), restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq), and seven outlier detection methods, we characterise genomic variation between populations along a strong biogeographical gradient. Of the three species, only S. granularis showed significant isolation-by-distance, and isolation-by-environment driven by sea surface temperatures (SST). In contrast, sea surface salinity (SSS) and range in air temperature correlated more strongly with genomic variation in C. punctatus and P. angulosus. Differences were also found in genomic structuring between the three species, with outlier loci contributing to two clusters in the East and West Coasts for S. granularis and P. angulosus, but not for C. punctatus. Conclusion: The findings illustrate distinct evolutionary potential across species, suggesting that species-specific habitat requirements and responses to environmental stresses may be better predictors of evolutionary patterns than the strong environmental gradients within the region. We also found large discrepancies between outlier detection methodologies, and thus offer a novel multi-model approach to identifying the principal environmental selection forces acting on species. Overall, this work highlights how adding a comparative approach to seascape genomics (both with multiple models and species) can elucidate the intricate evolutionary responses of ecosystems to global change. © 2020 The Author(s).","Comparative phylogeography; Environmental association; Marine invertebrates; Pool-seq; RAD-seq; Seascape genomics","environmental conditions; genomics; identification method; marine environment; natural selection; sympatry; Carcinus maenas; Cyclograpsus; Invertebrata; Parechinus angulosus; Scutellastra granularis; animal; Brachyura; DNA sequence; ecosystem; gastropod; genetic selection; genetics; genomics; population genetics; sea urchin; single nucleotide polymorphism; temperature; Animals; Brachyura; Ecosystem; Gastropoda; Genetics, Population; Genomics; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Sea Urchins; Selection, Genetic; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Temperature",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

In light of this, it is important to understand neutral gene flow patterns as a measure of dispersal potential, but also adaptive genetic variation as a measure of evolutionary potential. In order to assess genetic variation and how this relates to environment in the honeycomb worm (Sabellaria alveolata (L.)), a reef-building polychaete that supports high biodiversity, we carried out RAD sequencing using individuals from along its complete latitudinal range. Patterns of neutral population genetic structure were compared to larval dispersal as predicted by ocean circulation modelling, and outlier analyses and genotype-environment association tests were used to attempt to identify loci under selection in relation to local temperature data. Results: We genotyped 482 filtered SNPs, from 68 individuals across nine sites, 27 of which were identified as outliers using BAYESCAN and ARLEQUIN. All outlier loci were potentially under balancing selection, despite previous evidence of local adaptation in the system. Limited gene flow was observed among reef-sites (FST = 0.28 ± 0.10), in line with the low dispersal potential identified by the larval dispersal models. The North Atlantic reef emerged as a distinct population and this was linked to high local larval retention and the effect of the North Atlantic Current on dispersal. Conclusions: As an isolated population, with limited potential for natural genetic or demographic augmentation from other reefs, the North Atlantic site warrants conservation attention in order to preserve not only this species, but above all the crucial functional ecological roles that are associated with their bioconstructions. Our study highlights the utility of using seascape genomics to identify populations of conservation concern. © 2020 The Author(s).","Adaptation; Larval dispersal; Marine invertebrate; Ocean circulation modelling; RADseq","climate change; conservation planning; dispersal; fitness; gene flow; genetic structure; genetic variation; genomics; local adaptation; polychaete; reef; Atlantic Ocean; North Atlantic Current; Invertebrata; Polychaeta; Sabellaria alveolata; adaptation; Alveolata; animal; coral reef; gene flow; genetics; genomics; population genetics; Adaptation, Biological; Alveolata; Animals; Coral Reefs; Gene Flow; Genetics, Population; Genomics",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

However, it has only recently become possible to explore how convergent evolution is reflected at the genomic level. The overlapping outlier approach (OOA), where genome scans of multiple independent lineages are used to find outliers that overlap and therefore identify convergently evolving loci, is becoming popular. Here, we present a quantitative analysis of 34 studies that used this approach across many sampling designs, taxa, and sampling intensities. We found that OOA studies with increased biological sampling power within replicates have increased likelihood of finding overlapping, “convergent” signals of adaptation between them. When identifying convergent loci as overlapping outliers, it is tempting to assume that any false-positive outliers derived from individual scans will fail to overlap across replicates, but this cannot be guaranteed. We highlight how population demographics and genomic context can contribute toward both true convergence and false positives in OOA studies. We finish with an exploration of emerging methods that couple genome scans with phenotype and environmental measures, leveraging added information from genome data to more directly test hypotheses of the likelihood of convergent evolution. © 2019 The Authors.

This task requires identifying footprints of local selection but also estimating spatio-temporal variations in population demography and variations in recombination rate and in diversity along the genome. Here, we investigated these parameters in blue tit populations inhabiting deciduous versus evergreen forests, and insular versus mainland areas, in the context of a previously described strong phenotypic differentiation. Neighboring population pairs of deciduous and evergreen habitats were weakly genetically differentiated (FST = 0.003 on average), nevertheless with a statistically significant effect of habitat type on the overall genetic structure. This low differentiation was consistent with the strong and long-lasting gene flow between populations inferred by demographic modeling. In turn, insular and mainland populations were moderately differentiated (FST = 0.08 on average), in line with the inference of moderate ancestral migration, followed by isolation since the end of the last glaciation. Effective population sizes were large, yet smaller on the island than on the mainland. Weak and nonparallel footprints of divergent selection between deciduous and evergreen populations were consistent with their high connectivity and the probable polygenic nature of local adaptation in these habitats. In turn, stronger footprints of divergent selection were identified between long isolated insular versus mainland birds and were more often found in regions of low recombination, as expected from theory. Lastly, we identified a genomic inversion on the mainland, spanning 2.8 Mb. These results provide insights into the demographic history and genetic architecture of local adaptation in blue tit populations at multiple geographic scales. © 2020 The Authors.

Furthermore, structural variation as chromosomal rearrangements may facilitate adaptation despite high gene flow. However, our understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms impending or favouring local adaptation in the presence of gene flow is still limited to a restricted number of study systems. In this study, we examined how demographic history, shared ancestral polymorphism, and gene flow among glacial lineages contribute to local adaptation to sea conditions in a marine fish, the capelin (Mallotus villosus). We first assembled a 490-Mbp draft genome of M. villosus to map our RAD sequence reads. Then, we used a large data set of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (25,904 filtered SNPs) genotyped in 1,310 individuals collected from 31 spawning sites in the northwest Atlantic. We reconstructed the history of divergence among three glacial lineages and showed that they probably diverged from 3.8 to 1.8 million years ago and experienced secondary contacts. Within each lineage, our analyses provided evidence for large Ne and high gene flow among spawning sites. Within the Northwest Atlantic lineage, we detected a polymorphic chromosomal rearrangement leading to the occurrence of three haplogroups. Genotype–environment associations revealed molecular signatures of local adaptation to environmental conditions prevailing at spawning sites. Our study also suggests that both shared polymorphisms among lineages, resulting from standing genetic variation or introgression, and chromosomal rearrangements may contribute to local adaptation in the presence of high gene flow. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","fish; inversion; joint Site Frequency Spectrum; Mallotus villosus; population genomics; RAD; speciation; δaδi","adaptation; animal; Atlantic Ocean; evolution; gene flow; genetics; genome; Osmeriformes; physiology; single nucleotide polymorphism; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Atlantic Ocean; Biological Evolution; Gene Flow; Genome; Osmeriformes; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

Escalating climate and global changes present an imminent threat to Pacific communities, particularly for food security, livelihoods, health and safety, cultural identity and biodiversity conservation. A participatory community-based climate change adaptation planning process was used to engage with communities on Rendova Island in Western Province, Solomon Islands to identify local adaptation priorities. The methodology recognized that local community members are the managers of the resources they use daily, have direct knowledge of the status of key local resources and have direct influence over ongoing resource governance. The study focused on two objectives: (1) identifying community priorities and documenting them in adaptation plans intended for local implementation, and (2) evaluating whether community adaptation priorities addressed key vulnerabilities identified independently using a semi-quantitative vulnerability assessment. The adaptation priorities identified by the communities encompassed: governance, leadership and planning; farming and livestock; sustainable livelihoods; natural resource management; and youth capacity building. The community adaptation priorities were found to address the key climate change vulnerabilities identified in the semi-quantitative assessment and also addressed additional drivers of social vulnerability and adaptive capacity. This finding reiterates the importance of fully inclusive and participatory vulnerability assessments and community-identification of adaptation priorities coupled with scientific climate projections to comprehensively assess the complexity of social-ecological systems. The climate change adaptation priorities have informed ongoing local actions and are intended to be used by communities, government and NGOs to focus local effort, funding and project development. A review of the suitability of the adaptation priorities by similar villages on neighbouring islands would determine the utility of scaling-up and applying these adaptations to other rural communities in the Solomon Islands, and possibly more widely in other Pacific communities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation priorities; Climate change adaptation; Community-based adaptation; Participatory planning; Social-ecological systems; Solomon Islands","Agriculture; Biodiversity; Conservation; Ecology; Food supply; Health risks; Natural resources management; Rural areas; Adaptation to climate changes; Biodiversity conservation; Climate change adaptation; Community identification; Natural resource management; Quantitative assessments; Social-ecological systems; Vulnerability assessments; Climate change; adaptive management; capacity building; climate change; global change; government; local adaptation; nongovernmental organization; planning process; village; agricultural worker; article; capacity building; climate change; ecosystem; funding; human; juvenile; leadership; livestock; local adaptation; manager; natural resource; non-governmental organization; nonhuman; quantitative analysis; rural population; scale up; Solomon Islands; acclimatization; adolescent; ecosystem; island (geological); Melanesia; Solomon Islands [(ISG) Melanesia]; Acclimatization; Adolescent; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Humans; Islands; Melanesia",Article,"",Scopus

Regions of high differentiation can arise due to divergent selection acting on selected loci, genetic hitchhiking of nearby loci, or through repeated selection against deleterious alleles (linked background selection); this divergence may then be further elevated in regions of reduced recombination. Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) from Europe and North America diverged &gt;600,000 years ago and despite some evidence of secondary contact, the majority of genetic data indicate substantial divergence between lineages. This deep divergence with potential gene flow provides an opportunity to investigate the role of different mechanisms that shape the genomic landscape during early speciation. Here, using 184,295 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 80 populations, we investigate the genomic landscape of differentiation across the Atlantic Ocean with a focus on highly differentiated regions and the processes shaping them. We found evidence of high (mean FST = 0.26) and heterogeneous genomic differentiation between continents. Genomic regions associated with high trans-Atlantic differentiation ranged in size from single loci (SNPs) within important genes to large regions (1–3 Mbp) on four chromosomes (Ssa06, Ssa13, Ssa16 and Ssa19). These regions showed signatures consistent with selection, including high linkage disequilibrium, despite no significant reduction in recombination. Genes and functional enrichment of processes associated with differentiated regions may highlight continental differences in ocean navigation and parasite resistance. Our results provide insight into potential mechanisms underlying differences between continents, and evidence of near-fixed and potentially adaptive trans-Atlantic differences concurrent with a background of high genome-wide differentiation supports subspecies designation in Atlantic salmon. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adaptation; conservation genetics; fish; genomics; population genetics","animal; Atlantic Ocean; Europe; genetic selection; genetics; genomics; molecular evolution; North America; Salmo salar; single nucleotide polymorphism; United States; Animals; Atlantic Ocean; Europe; Evolution, Molecular; Genomics; North America; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Salmo salar; Selection, Genetic; United States",Article,"",Scopus

This study was framed to investigate the population structure of M. micrantha at a large spatial scale in Asia and to identify how introduction history, evolutionary forces and landscape features influenced the genetic pattern of the species in this region. Methods: We assessed the genetic diversity and structure of 1052 individuals from 46 populations for 12 microsatellite loci. The spatial pattern of genetic variation was investigated by estimating the relationship between genetic distance and geographical, climatic and landscape resistances hypothesized to influence gene flow between populations. Key Results: We found high genetic diversity of M. micrantha in this region, as compared with the genetic diversity parameters of other invasive species. Spatial and non-spatial clustering algorithms identified the presence of multiple genetic clusters and admixture between populations. Most of the populations showed heterozygote deficiency, primarily due to inbreeding, and the founder populations showed evidence of a genetic bottleneck. Persistent gene flow throughout the invasive range caused low genetic differentiation among populations and provided beneficial genetic variation to the marginal populations in a heterogeneous environment. Environmental suitability was found to buffer the detrimental effects of inbreeding at the leading edge of range expansion. Both linear and non-linear regression models demonstrated a weak relationship between genetic distance and geographical distance, as well as bioclimatic variables and environmental resistance surfaces. Conclusions: These findings provide evidence that extensive gene flow and admixture between populations have influenced the current genetic pattern of M. micrantha in this region. High gene flow across the invaded landscape may facilitate adaptation, establishment and long-term persistence of the population, thereby indicating the range expansion ability of the species. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Salt marsh systems in California have been highly modified and many salt marsh obligate species have undergone range reductions and habitat loss with concomitant losses of genetic diversity and connectivity. Remaining salt marshes are threatened by rising sea levels, and so these habitats will likely require active restoration and re-establishment efforts. This study aims to provide a reference point for the current status of genetic diversity and range-wide population structure of a federally and state listed endangered plant, salt marsh bird’s-beak (Chloropyron maritimum subsp. maritimum) that can inform future preservation and restoration efforts. We used historical data and current monitoring information to locate and sample all known occurrences throughout the range of this subspecies in southern California, and three additional occurrences from Baja California, Mexico. We used flow cytometry and single nucleotide polymorphic markers (SNPs), generated by double-digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD), to assess relative ploidy, and estimate genetic diversity and population structure across the region. Overall, we found five distinct genetic clusters that coincide with geographic regions. Genetic diversity was greatest in the southern part of the range including Baja California and San Diego.

The changing climate is altering species distributions with consequences for population dynamics, resulting in winners and losers in the Anthropocene. 2. Agraulis vanillae, the gulf fritillary butterfly, has expanded its range in the past 100 years in the western U.S.A. Time series analysis is combined with species distribution modelling to investigate factors limiting the distribution of A. vanillae and to predict future shifts under warming scenarios. 3. Time series analyses from the western U.S.A. show that urban development has a positive association with year of colonisation (the host plant Passiflora is an ornamental in gardens). Colonisation was also associated positively and to a lesser extent with winter maximum temperatures, whereas a negative impact of minimum temperatures and precipitation was apparent on population growth rates after establishment. 4. Species distribution models vary by region. In the eastern U.S.A., the butterfly is primarily limited by minimum temperatures in the winter and host availability later in the season. Eastern U.S. projected expansion broadly follows the expectation of poleward distributional shifts, especially for the butterfly's maximum annual extent. Western U.S. distributions are limited by the host plant, which in turn is dependent on urban centres. Projected western U.S. expansion is not limited to a single direction and is driven by urban centres becoming more suitable for the host plant. 5.

Here, we used genotype-by-sequencing analysis of 514 trochus samples collected from 17 locations (15 in the inshore Kimberley, 2 offshore oceanic sites). Analysis of 5428 polymorphic single nucleotide polymorphism loci revealed significant genetic subdivision between the oceanic and coastal sites, and a subset of loci exhibited significantly higher subdivision, suggesting they are subject to directional selection. Population differentiation was also evident between the two oceanic sites, but not between coastal sites. Trochus populations from the coastal Kimberley and oceanic reefs represent two genetically and demographically independent units, with preliminary evidence for local adaptation to these distinctive environments. Management strategies for R. nilotica reflect these divisions, but the limited connectivity among oceanic populations indicates that they are vulnerable to overexploitation.

To assess population genetic structure as well as detection for local adaptation of E. japonicus, a total of 389 individuals from six regional populations of the northwestern Pacific were collected and a set of 12,627 SNPs was developed. Marginal significant genetic structure (average FST value was approximately equal to 0.002) was detected between regional populations of “the Bohai Sea population (BHS)” and the “the Japan Sea population (JPS)” as well as between “the North Yellow Sea population (NYS),” and the “the Japan Sea population (JPS)”. Moreover, no sign of local adaptation was detected, which might be the product of high gene flow among regional populations. Overall, our results improve the understanding of fine-scale population genetic structure in E. japonicus and potentially identify management unit in this species. © Copyright © 2020 Zhang, Li, Xue and Liu.","Engraulis japonicus; genetic structures; population genomics; RAD-seq; single nucleotide polymorphism",,Article,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus

However, population genetic structure in marine fishes has been proposed to be highly limited, which might be attributed to fewer barriers to gene flow as well as large population sizes, resulting in relatively high levels of connectivity among populations. Population genomic approaches have increased the accessibility and resolution of population genetic data to make ecological inferences, which made it possible to detect previously unidentiﬁed structure and obtain more accurate estimates of demographic parameters in wild populations. Here, we used restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing to sample genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of Larimichthys polyactis, a marine fish species of high ecological and commercial importance distributed in coast of East Asia. To assess range-wide patterns of population structure of L. polyactis, a total of 93 individuals were sampled from six geographic localities along the coast of China. Two final datasets were developed from the nuclear and the mitochondrial genomes, which consisted of 14, 194 SNPs and 15 SNPs respectively. Pairwise FST across sampling localities were not significant and most genetic variation was found within individuals rather than among populations within groups or among groups. Both clustering analyses and discriminant analysis failed to detect any population structure. Our findings demonstrated the persistence of high levels of genetic connectivity and a lack of population structure across sampling locations of L. polyactis in inshore waters of China. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Larimichthys polyactis; Population genomics; RAD-seq; Single-nucleotide polymorphisms",,Article,"",Scopus

To overcome ecological limitation, local adaptation of peripheral populations is assumed necessary to extend niche space and thus to potentially facilitate species’ range expansion. However, adaptive changes do not necessarily correspond to current ecological marginality. Instead, population history may provide a fuller context for understanding patterns of local adaptation within the species range. Here, we test whether local adaptation to current conditions or population history explains current species distribution in an annual heterocarpic species, Atriplex tatarica, in Europe. The ecological marginality and population history were estimated using species distribution modelling (SDM) and 13 microsatellite markers. To test for local adaptation, we evaluated the population performance of both currently central and currently peripheral populations by examining germination and growth traits under three temperature regimes which correspond to climates within, and also beyond, the species’ current range. In addition, we compared Bayesian estimates of population differentiation in neutral genetic markers and quantitative traits to test whether phenotypic differentiation evolved by local adaptation and/or by genetic drift. We found population performances were not higher under temperature regimes corresponding to their own habitats, suggesting that patterns of local adaptation in A. tatarica do not correspond to current centre–periphery gradient. In contrast, population genetic structure indicated a strong influence of population history on variation in the germination phenotype. Species distribution modelling suggested a more cold–tolerant genetic lineage was located at the species' range periphery during the last glacial period. Meanwhile, a less cold-tolerant lineage occurred in more suitable areas of the Balkan Peninsula and southeastern Europe. Thus, the strong adaptive divergence of evolutionary lineages may reflect a past spatial arrangement of populations, suggesting evolutionary processes were ongoing before the species expansion in the Holocene. Synthesis. There is continuing debate concerning the speed of trait evolution during range expansion with climate change. Our results indicate that even though organisms expand rapidly, the accompanying evolutionary changes in phenotype may be much slower. © 2019 British Ecological Society","Atriplex tatarica; centre–periphery hypothesis; climatic niche; environmental suitability; evolutionary processes; heterocarpy; last glacial maximum; range shift","annual cycle; annual plant; germination; herb; Holocene; local adaptation; performance assessment; population theory; range expansion; thermal regime; Europe; Atriplex tatarica",Article,"",Scopus

However, according to documented records, S. alterniflora from different origins were introduced to different areas when the species was first introduced to the coastal areas of China in the 1980s. In order to understand the relationship between the invasive S. alterniflora populations of China and the native S. alterniflora populations of the United States, and whether the genetic structure and genetic diversity of the invasive populations of China were affected by different introductions in the 1980s, molecular markers were used to determine the levels of gene flow and its effect on population differentiation. A total of 715 samples of S. alterniflora were collected from nine invasive populations in China and nine native populations from the United States. The genetic diversity and genetic structure of invasive and native populations were compared using microsatellite markers. The heterozygosity of Chinese invasive populations of S. alterniflora (HO = 0.538, HE = 0.725) were similar with those of native populations (HO = 0.530, HE = 0.744), which may attribute to its multiple introductions with the multisource populations from different geographic areas of the United States. However, the lower allelic diversities of Chinese invasive populations were detected, which may be due to the founder effect, or the bottleneck, which supports the theory that the allelic diversity is more sensitive to population bottlenecks than heterozygosity. The results of the STRUCTURE analysis among all sampling sites showed that the value of ΔK was largest when K = 2, which indicated that the invasive S. alterniflora populations in China had completed differentiated from the native populations of the United States. This may be because of admixture and hybridization of three non-overlapping original populations, or the postintroduction rapid evolution in China, and reproductive isolation under long-term geographic isolation. There was significant differentiation among invasive populations, which was mainly affected by different human-mediated introductions in 1980s. Significant genetic structure (K = 7) and high genetic differentiation (Fst = 0.30193) were detected in Chinese invasive populations, which may due to the low natural gene flow among populations. The genetic structure of the invasive populations in China was still affected by the human-mediated introductions in the 1980s, and the different initial introductions might promote differentiation among the invasive populations. In fact, the human-mediated long-distance dispersal should take the most of responsibility for the rapid spread of S. alterniflora along the coast of China. Multisource introductions of S. alterniflora are perhaps helpful for local adaptation but itself cannot cause rapid spread along the whole coast of China. Meanwhile, we suggest that the prevention of gene exchange among populations of S. alterniflora is the first and most important step in the control of the species on the coast of China, because admixture and hybridization of isolated populations might generate new heterosis and increase the difficulty of managing S. alterniflora in China. © Copyright © 2020 Xia, Geng and An.","gene flow; genetic diversity; genetic structure; hybridization; multiple introductions; rapid evolution","article; China; founder effect; gene flow; gene structure; genetic variability; heterosis; heterozygosity; human; invasive species; local adaptation; major clinical study; male; microsatellite marker; nonhuman; population differentiation; reproductive isolation; responsibility; seashore; structure analysis; United States",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

To help make land-use and climate change adaptation policies more effective at a local scale, this study used a combination of participatory approaches and computer simulationmodeling. Thismethodology (called the ""ParticipatoryWatershed Land-use Management"" (PWLM) approach) consist of four major steps: (a) Scenario analysis, (b) impact assessment, (c) developing adaptation and mitigation measures and its integration in local government policies, and (d) improvement of land use plan. As a test case, we conducted PWLM in the Santa Rosa Sub-watershed of the Philippines, a rapidly urbanizing area outside Metro Manila. The scenario analysis step involved a participatory land-use mapping activity (to understand future likely land-use changes), as well as GCM precipitation and temperature data downscaling (to understand the local climate scenarios). For impact assessment, the Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) tool was used to simulate future river water quality (BOD and E. coli) under a Business as Usual (BAU) scenario and several alternative future scenarios considering different drivers and pressures (to 2030). Water samples from the Santa Rosa River in 2015 showed that BOD values ranged from 13 to 52 mg/L; indicating that the river is already moderately to extremely polluted compared to desirable water quality (class B). In the future scenarios, we found that water quality will deteriorate further by 2030 under all scenarios. Population growth was found to have the highest impact on future water quality deterioration, while climate change had the lowest (although not negligible). After the impact assessment, different mitigation measures were suggested in a stakeholder consultation workshop, and of them (enhanced capacity of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and increased sewerage connection rate) were adopted to generate a final scenario including countermeasures. The main benefit of the PWLM approach are its high level of stakeholder involvement (through co-generation of the research) and use of free (for developing countries) software and models, both of which contribute to an enhanced science-policy interface. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change adaptation; Domestic wastewater management; Sustainable development goals; Urbanization; Water quality; WEAP","Deterioration; Developing countries; Economic and social effects; Escherichia coli; Land use; Marine pollution; Population statistics; Quality control; River pollution; Rivers; Wastewater treatment; Water management; Water quality; Watersheds; Climate change adaptation; Participatory approach; Science - policy interfaces; Stakeholder consultation; Stakeholder involvement; Wastewater treatment plants; Water quality deterioration; Waterresource management; Climate change; climate change; coastal water; downscaling; general circulation model; local government; participatory approach; population growth; software; urbanization; wastewater treatment plant; water management; watershed; Guatemala [Central America]; National Capital Region; Philippines; Santa Rosa",Article,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus

Contrary to this assumption, however, genetic differentiation is often observed in marine invertebrates. In the present study, we sought to explain how population structure is established in the western Pacific Ocean, where the strong Kuroshio Current maintains high levels of gene flow from south to north, presumably promoting genetic homogeneity. We determined the population structure of the pearl oyster, Pinctada fucata, in the Indo-Pacific Ocean using genome-wide genotyping data from multiple sampling localities. Cluster analysis showed that the western Pacific population is distinct from that of the Indian Ocean, and that it is divided into northern (Japanese mainland) and southern (Nansei Islands, China, and Cambodia) populations. Genetic differentiation of P. fucata can be explained by geographic barriers in the Indian Ocean and a local lagoon, and by environmental gradients of sea surface temperature (SST) and oxygen concentration in the western Pacific. A genome scan showed evidence of adaptive evolution in genomic loci, possibly associated with changes in environmental factors, including SST and oxygen concentration. Furthermore, Bayesian simulation demonstrated that the past population expansion and division are congruent with ocean warming after the last glacial period. It is highly likely that the environmental gradient forms a genetic barrier that diversifies P. fucata populations in the western Pacific.

Genetic diversity is an important determinant of population fitness and resilience, and can require careful management to ensure sufficient variation is present. In addition, population genetics data reveal patterns of connectivity and gene flow between locations, enabling mangers to predict recovery and resilience, identify areas of local adaptation, and generate restoration plans. Here, we demonstrate a conservation genetics approach to inform restoration and management of the loggerhead sponge (Spheciospongia vesparium) in the Florida Keys, USA. This species is a dominant, habitat-forming component of marine ecosystems in the Caribbean region, but in Florida has suffered numerous mass mortality events. We developed microsatellite markers and used them to genotype sponges from 14 locations in Florida and a site each in The Bahamas, Belize and Barbuda. We found that genetic diversity levels were similar across all sites, but inbreeding and bottleneck signatures were present in Florida. Populations are highly structured at the regional scale, whilst within Florida connectivity is present in a weak isolation by distance pattern, coupled with chaotic genetic patchiness. Evidence of a weak barrier to gene flow was found in Florida among sites situated on opposite sides of the islands in the Middle Keys. Loggerhead sponge populations in Florida are vulnerable in the face of mass mortalities due to low connectivity with other areas in the region, as well as distance-limited and unpredictable local connectivity patterns. However, our discovery of Florida’s high genetic diversity increases hope for resilience to future perturbations. These results provide valuable insight for sponge restoration practice in Florida. © 2020, The Author(s).","Caribbean; Conservation; Florida Keys; Loggerhead sponge; Porifera; Spheciospongia vesparium","connectivity; conservation genetics; conservation management; ecosystem resilience; fitness; gene flow; genetic marker; genetic variation; inbreeding; keystone species; local adaptation; marine ecosystem; population bottleneck; population decline; restoration ecology; sponge; Antigua and Barbuda; Bahamas; Barbuda; Belize [Central America]; Caribbean Islands; Florida Keys; Florida [United States]; Leeward Islands [Lesser Antilles]; United States; Caretta caretta; Porifera; Spheciospongia vesparium",Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus

This debate may, in part, be resolved by considering prey experience, which shapes prey traits (through genetic and plastic change) and influences prey survival (and therefore density). Here, we investigate the cascading role of prey experience through the addition of mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) from predator-experienced or predator-naïve sources to mesocosms containing piscivorous largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), zooplankton, and phytoplankton. These two sources were positioned along a competition-defense tradeoff. Results show that predator-naïve mosquitofish suffered higher depredation rates, which drove a density-mediated cascade, whereas predator-experienced mosquitofish exhibited higher survival but fed less, which drove a trait-mediated cascade. Both cascades were similar in strength, leading to indistinguishable top-down effects on lower trophic levels. Therefore, the accumulation of prey experience with predators can cryptically shift cascade mechanisms from density- to trait-mediated. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Competition-defense tradeoffs; Consumptive effects; Cryptic dynamics; Gambusia affinis; Non-consumptive effects; Predator experience; Trophic cascades","competition (ecology); crypsis; cyprinid; food consumption; local adaptation; population density; prey location; top-down control; trade-off; trophic cascade; Gambusia affinis; Micropterus; Micropterus salmoides; acclimatization; animal; food chain; phytoplankton; predation; zooplankton; Acclimatization; Animals; Food Chain; Phytoplankton; Predatory Behavior; Zooplankton",Article,"",Scopus

The framework parameterized with some synthetic parameters have been coined as VAHMB (Vulnerability assessment for heavy metal bioaccumulation). Tissue metal concentrations (Cadmium, Lead, Mercury) in brown trout (Salmo trutta fario) and habitat metal signatures (sediment loads) was studied in six brooks inside Boletice Military Training Area (Boletice MTA), Czech Republic. Heavy metal burdens in the sediments of military area brooks were flagged safe. The tissue concentration of metals never touched critical limits but numerous cases of breaching Q3-ceilings (>75% of the critical limit) were recorded. Majority of vulnerable bioaccumulation cases were restricted to shooting area (large gears) brooks and observed for Hg. Highest bio-affinity was exhibited by Hg followed by Cd and Pb. Significantly strong, positive multicollinearity exists among heavy metals and between sediment-flesh metal concentrations. No morpho-biological dependency on heavy metal uptake was observed, however, negative implications on population fitness (Fulton's condition factor) was apparent. A ‘nascent heavy metal exposure (NHME)’ at certain sediment metal concentrations was observed during which population fitness steeply deteriorates. It is followed by a ‘range of active adaptation (RAA)’ where deterioration of population fitness finally stabilizes. Under prevailing conditions in Boletice MTA, bioaccumulation of Cd and Pb up to critical levels seem difficult; even though Cd can bioaccumulate beyond Q3-ceilings. Prominent threat exists for reaching critical Hg bioaccumulation levels. Brooks adjacent to shooting areas should be subjected to periodic monitoring of Hg. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Ammunition residues; Bioaccumulation affinity; Firing exercises; Heavy metal leaching; Heavy metal pollution; Military area soil; Modeling; Population fitness; Q3-ceiling; Risk analyses; Salmonids","Bioaccumulation; Biochemistry; Ceilings; Deterioration; Fish; Fisheries; Health; Models; Regression analysis; Risk analysis; Sediments; Soil pollution control; Tissue; Firing exercises; Heavy metal pollution; Metal leaching; Military areas; Population fitness; Salmonids; Heavy metals; adaptation; bioaccumulation; fish; growth modeling; heavy metal; local adaptation; modeling; risk assessment; salmonid; soil pollution; Czech Republic; Salmo trutta; Salmo trutta fario; Salmonidae",Article,"",Scopus

These small fish occur in marine and freshwater habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere, and in numerous cases the smaller freshwater populations have been established ""de novo"" from marine colonists. Independently evolved freshwater populations exhibit similar phenotypes that have been shown to derive largely from the same standing genetic variants. Geographic isolation prevents direct migration between the freshwater populations, strongly suggesting that these shared locally adaptive alleles are transported through the marine population. However it is still largely unknown how gene flow, recombination, and selection jointly impact the standing variation that might fuel this adaptation. Here we use individual-based, spatially explicit simulations to determine the levels of gene flow that best match observed patterns of allele sharing among habitats in stickleback. We aim to better understand how gene flow and local adaptation in large metapopulations determine the speed of adaptation and re-use of standing genetic variation. In our simulations we find that repeated adaptation uses a shared set of alleles that are maintained at low frequency by migration-selection balance in oceanic populations. This process occurs over a realistic range of intermediate levels of gene flow that match previous empirical population genomic studies in stickleback. Examining these simulations more deeply reveals how lower levels of gene flow leads to slow, independent adaptation to different habitats, whereas higher levels of gene flow leads to significant mutation load - but an increased probability of successful population genomic scans for locally adapted alleles. Surprisingly, we find that the genealogical origins of most freshwater adapted alleles can be traced back to the original generation of marine individuals that colonized the lakes, as opposed to subsequent migrants. These simulations provide deeper context for existing studies of stickleback evolutionary genomics, and guidance for future empirical studies in this model. More broadly, our results support existing theory of local adaptation but extend it by more completely documenting the genealogical history of adaptive alleles in a metapopulation.

The leading hypothesis is that this similarity in divergence is driven by parallel natural selection. However, several recent studies have suggested that these patterns may instead be a product of the depletion of genetic variation that occurs as result of background selection (i.e., linked negative selec-tion). To date, there have been few direct tests of these competing hypotheses. To determine the relative contributions of background selection and parallel selection to patterns of repeated differentiation, we examined 24 independently derived populations of freshwater stickleback occupying a variety of niches and estimated genomic patterns of differentiation in each relative to their common marine ancestor. Patterns of genetic differentiation were strongly correlated across pairs of freshwater populations adapting to the same ecological niche, supporting a role for parallel natural selection. In contrast to other recent work, our study comparing populations adapting to the same niche produced no evidence signifying that similar patterns of genomic differentiation are generated by background selection. We also found that overall patterns of genetic differentiation were considerably more similar for populations found in closer geographic proximity. In fact, the effect of geography on the repeatability of differentiation was greater than that of parallel selection. Our results suggest that shared selective landscapes and ancestral variation are the key drivers of repeated patterns of differentiation in systems that have recently colonized novel environments. © 2019 by The University of Chicago.","Adaptive evolution; Gasterosteus aculeatus; Genomics; Natural selection; Parallel evolution; Threespine stickleback","freshwater ecosystem; genetic differentiation; genomics; hypothesis testing; natural selection; niche partitioning; Gasterosteus; Gasterosteus aculeatus; fresh water; sea water; adaptation; animal; ecosystem; evolution; genetic selection; genetic variation; genetics; geography; population genetics; single nucleotide polymorphism; Smegmamorpha; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Biological Evolution; Ecosystem; Fresh Water; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Geography; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Seawater; Selection, Genetic; Smegmamorpha",Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus

The Chinese tapertail, or Japanese grenadier anchovy, Coilia nasus, is a valuable migratory fish of high economic importance and special migratory dimorphism (with certain individuals as non-migratory residents). Results: In this study, an 870.0-Mb high-quality genome was assembled by the combination of Illumina and Pacific Biosciences sequencing. Approximately 812.1 Mb of scaffolds were linked to 24 chromosomes using a high-density genetic map from a family of 104 full siblings and their parents. In addition, population sequencing of 96 representative individuals from diverse areas along the putative migration path identified 150 candidate genes, which are mainly enriched in 3 Ca2+-related pathways. Based on integrative genomic and transcriptomic analyses, we determined that the 3 Ca2+-related pathways are critical for promotion of migratory adaption. A large number of molecular markers were also identified, which distinguished migratory individuals and non-migratory freshwater residents. Conclusions: We assembled a chromosome-level genome for the Chinese tapertail anchovy. The genome provided a valuable genetic resource for understanding of migratory adaption and population genetics and will benefit the aquaculture and management of this economically important fish. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

The number of the Japanese eels has been dramatically declining over the last four decades, and it is now listed as an endangered species (International Union for Conservation of Nature [IUCN] 2014). To manage and conserve this endangered species, it is necessary to assess population genetic diversity, genetic structure, and identify regions of the genomes that are under selection. Here, we generated a catalog of novel single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for the Japanese eel using restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing of 24 individuals from two geographic locations. The 73,557 identified SNPs were widely distributed across the draft genome of the Japanese eel. No genetic differentiation between the two populations was detected based on all loci or neutral loci. However, highly significant genetic differentiation was detected based on loci that appeared to be under selection. BLAST2GO annotations of the outlier SNPs yielded hits for 61 (72%) of 85 significant BLASTX matches. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis identified some of the putative targets of local selection, including genes in several important pathways such as calcium signaling pathway and intestinal immune network for IgA production.

Vernal pool clam shrimp (Eulimnadia texana) are a promising model due to ease of culturing, short generation time, small genomes, and obligate desiccated diapaused eggs. Clam shrimp are also androdioecious (sexes include males and hermaphrodites), and here we use population-scaled recombination rates to support the hypothesis that the heterogametic sex is recombination free in these shrimp. We collected short-read sequence data from pooled samples from different vernal pools to gain insights into local adaptation. We identify genomic regions in which some populations have allele frequencies that differ significantly from the metapopulation. BayPass (Gautier M. 2015. Genome-wide scan for adaptive divergence and association with population-specific covariates. Genetics 201(4):1555-1579.) detected 19 such genomic regions showing an excess of population subdivision. These regions on average are 550 bp in size and had 2.5 genes within 5 kb of them. Genes located near these regions are involved in Malpighian tubule function and osmoregulation, an essential function in vernal pools.

Rapid organismal responses to thermal environmental changes have been described for several ectotherms; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms often remain unclear. Here, we studied whole genome cytosine methylation patterns of European grayling (Thymallus thymallus) embryos from five populations with contemporary adaptations of early life history traits at either ‘colder’ or ‘warmer’ spawning grounds. We reared fish embryos in a common garden experiment using two temperatures that resembled the ‘colder’ and ‘warmer’ conditions of the natal natural environments. Genome-wide methylation patterns were similar in populations originating from colder thermal origin subpopulations, whereas single nucleotide polymorphisms uncovered from the same data identified strong population structure among isolated populations, but limited structure among interconnected populations. This was surprising, because the previously studied gene expression response among populations was mostly plastic, and mainly influenced by the developmental temperature. These findings support the hypothesis of the magnified role of epigenetic mechanisms in modulating plasticity. The abundance of consistently changing methylation loci between two warmer-to-colder thermal origin population pairs suggests that local adaptation has shaped the observed methylation patterns. The dynamic nature of the methylomes was further highlighted by genome-wide and site-specific plastic responses. Our findings support both the presence of a plastic response in a subset of CpG loci, and the evolutionary role of methylation divergence between populations adapting to contrasting thermal environments. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Cytosine methylation; developmental plasticity; epigenetic variation; promoter; salmonid; SNP; thermal adaptation; transcription","article; DNA methylation; embryo; epigenetics; gene expression; life history trait; local adaptation; methylome; nonhuman; population structure; promoter region; salmonid; single nucleotide polymorphism; spawning; temperature acclimatization; animal; DNA methylation; genetic variation; temperature; cytosine; Animals; Cytosine; DNA Methylation; Genetic Variation; Salmonidae; Temperature",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

Using an analysis of molecular variance framework, we tested whether populations were more structured by geographic distance or environmental extremes. The genetic patterns we observed followed isolation by environment, where nearshore and adjacent offshore populations showed significant genetic structure at both locations (AMOVA FST = 0.04∼0.19, P &lt; 0.001), but no significant isolation by distance between islands. Strikingly, corals from the two nearshore sites with higher levels of environmental stressors on different islands over 100 km apart with similar environmentally stressful conditions were genetically closer (FST = 0.0, P = 0.73) than those within a single location less than 2 km apart (FST = 0.04∼0.08, P &lt; 0.01). In contrast, a third site with a less impacted nearshore site (i.e., less pronounced environmental gradient) showed no significant structure from the offshore comparison. Our results show much stronger support for environment than distance separating these populations. Our finding suggests that ecological boundaries from human impacts may play a role in forming genetic structure in the coastal environment, and that genetic divergence in the absence of geographical barriers to gene flow might be explained by selective pressure across contrasting habitats.

We studied both postulated channels by sequencing methylomes and genomes of Baltic three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) along a salinity cline. Wild populations differing in salinity tolerance revealed differential methylation (pop-DMS) at genes enriched for osmoregulatory processes. A two-generation experiment demonstrated that 62% of these pop-DMS were noninducible by salinity manipulation, suggesting that they are the result of either direct selection or associated genomic divergence at cis- or trans-regulatory sites. Two-thirds of the remaining inducible pop-DMS increased in similarity to patterns detected in wild populations from corresponding salinities. The level of similarity accentuated over consecutive generations, indicating a mechanism of transgenerational plasticity. While we can attribute natural DNA methylation patterns to the two information channels, their interplay with genomic variation in salinity adaptation is still unresolved.

In salmonid fishes, lakes have been shown to have a strong influence on dispersal and gene flow within catchments; for example, populations spawning in inflow streams are often reproductively isolated and genetically distinct from those spawning in relatively distant outflow streams. Less is known, however, regarding the level of philopatry and genetic differentiation occurring at microgeographic scales, for example, where inflow and outflow streams are separated by very small expanses of lake habitat. Here, we investigated the interplay between genetic differentiation and fine-scale spawning movements of brown trout between their lake-feeding habitat and two spawning streams (one inflow, one outflow, separated by <100 m of lake habitat). Most (69.2%) of the lake-tagged trout subsequently detected during the spawning period were recorded in just one of the two streams, consistent with natal fidelity, while the remainder were detected in both streams, creating an opportunity for these individuals to spawn in both natal and non-natal streams. The latter behavior was supported by genetic sibship analysis, which revealed several half-sibling dyads containing one individual that was sampled as a fry in the outflow and another that was sampled as fry in the inflow. Genetic clustering analyses in conjunction with telemetry data suggested that asymmetrical dispersal patterns were occurring, with natal fidelity being more common among individuals originating from the outflow than the inflow stream. This was corroborated by Bayesian analysis of gene flow, which indicated significantly higher rates of gene flow from the inflow into the outflow than vice versa. Collectively, these results reveal how a combination of telemetry and genetics can identify distinct reproductive behaviors and associated asymmetries in natal dispersal that produce subtle, but nonetheless biologically relevant, population structuring at microgeographic scales. © 2019 The Authors.

However, divergence can still occur despite gene flow if strong selection acts on populations occupying different ecological niches. Here, we examined the population genomics of an ectoparasitic snail, Coralliophila violacea (Kiener 1836), that specializes on Porites corals in the Indo-Pacific. Previous genetic analyses revealed two sympatric lineages associated with different coral hosts. In this study, we examined the mechanisms promoting and maintaining the snails’ adaptation to their coral hosts. Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from type II restriction site-associated DNA (2b-RAD) sequencing revealed two differentiated clusters of C. violacea that were largely concordant with coral host, consistent with previous genetic results. However, the presence of some admixed genotypes indicates gene flow from one lineage to the other. Combined, these results suggest that differentiation between host-associated lineages of C. violacea is occurring in the face of ongoing gene flow, requiring strong selection. Indeed, 2.7% of all SNP loci were outlier loci (73/2,718), indicative of divergence with gene flow, driven by adaptation of each C. violacea lineage to their specific coral hosts. © 2020 The Authors.

Previous studies suggested that there might be demographic differences between coastal lagoons and riverine environments, as well as divergent populations that could be reproductively isolated. Here, we investigated the genetic diversity pattern of this taxon in the Southern Neotropical Basin system that includes the La Plata Basin, Patos-Merin lagoon basin and the coastal lagoons draining to the SW Atlantic Ocean, through a population genomics approach using 2b-RAD-sequencing-derived single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The genomic scan identified selection footprints associated with divergence and suggested local adaptation environmental drivers. Two major genomic clusters latitudinally distributed in the Northern and Southern basins were identified, along with consistent signatures of divergent selection between them. Population structure based on the whole set of loci and on the presumptive neutral vs. adaptive loci showed deep genomic divergence between the two major clusters. Annotation of the most consistent SNPs under divergent selection revealed some interesting candidate genes for further functional studies. Moreover, signals of adaptation to a coastal lagoon environment mediated by purifying selection were found. These new insights provide a better understanding of the complex evolutionary history of R. quelen in the southernmost basin of the Neotropical region. © 2020 by the authors.

The species has been considered as an important stream organism for studying genetics, dispersal, biology, behaviour and evolution in atyids and is a major food source for stream dwelling fishes. Paratya australiensis is a cryptic species complex consisting of nine highly divergent mitochondrial DNA lineages. Previous studies in southeast Queensland showed that ""lineage 4"" favours upstream sites at higher altitudes, with cooler water temperatures. This study aims to identify putative selection and population structure between high elevation and low elevation populations of this lineage at relatively small spatial scales. Sample localities were selected from three streams: Booloumba Creek, Broken Bridge Creek and Obi Obi Creek in the Conondale Range, southeast Queensland. Six sample localities, consisting of 142 individuals in total were sequenced using double digest Restriction Site Associated DNA-sequencing (ddRAD-seq) technique. Among the 142 individuals, 131 individuals shared 213 loci. Outlier analysis on 213 loci showed that 27 loci were putatively under selection between high elevation and low elevation populations. Outlier analysis on individual streams was also done to test for parallel patterns of adaptation, but there was no evidence of a parallel pattern. Population structure was observed using both the 27 outliers and 186 neutral loci and revealed similar population structure in both cases. Therefore, we cannot differentiate between selection and drift here. The highest genetic differentiation was observed between high elevation and low elevation populations of Booloumba Creek, with small levels of differentiation in the other two streams. © 2020 Rahman et al.","Freshwater shrimp; Genetic structure; Local adaptation; Outliers; Stream network","adaptation; altitude acclimatization; aquaculture; Article; comparative study; DNA extraction; DNA sequence; entropy; freshwater fish; gene frequency; gene structure; genetic analysis; genetic variability; genotype; haplotype; heterozygosity; limnology; mitochondrial gene; nonhuman; Paratya australiensis; phylogeny; population structure; prevalence; shrimp; single nucleotide polymorphism; water temperature",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Insular conditions can also induce new selective pressures on populations. Here, we investigated the extent of genetic differentiation within a white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) population introduced on an island and its differentiation with its source mainland population. In response to their novel environmental conditions, introduced deer changed phenotypically from mainland individuals, therefore we investigated the genetic bases of the morphological differentiation. The study was conducted on Anticosti Island (Québec, Canada) where 220 individuals were introduced 120 years ago, resulting in a population size over 160,000 individuals. We used genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) to generate 8,518 filtered high-quality SNPs and compared patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation between the continental and Anticosti Island populations. Clustering analyses indicated a single panmictic island population and no sign of isolation by distance. Our results revealed a weak, albeit highly significant, genetic differentiation between the Anticosti Island population and its source population (mean FST = 0.005), which allowed a population assignment success of 93%. Also, the high genetic diversity maintained in the introduced population supports the absence of a strong founder effect due to the large number of founders followed by rapid population growth. We further used a polygenic approach to assess the genetic bases of the divergent phenotypical traits between insular and continental populations. We found loci related to muscular function and lipid metabolism, which suggested that these could be involved in local adaptation on Anticosti Island.

It is important to understand these adaptations in fisheries stocks to fully inform fisheries management strategies. With this is mind, sea temperatures are an important cue in timing for many marine species, including sole in the North-East Atlantic Ocean. We used spawning data and modelled sea surface temperature (SST) data from sole subpopulations to examine the possibility of local adaptation of their spawning times to rising temperature. Climate window analysis was used, in a linear mixed model using mean spawning week and SST, to investigate statistically significant differences between subpopulations of sole. There was no evidence of local adaptation to changing temperatures for these subpopulations. This suggests that their spawning-time reaction to changing temperatures is currently due to their subpopulation's mean plasticity. Using climate window analysis and modelled temperature data we have demonstrated a method of examining spawning changes in marine populations along a temperature gradient. Recruitment and spawning success are key elements of fisheries population models which contribute to fisheries management. Further understanding of the influence of temperature on recruitment will help inform future modelling. © 2019 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2019.

Thus, it is important for practitioners of different biological disciplines to understand new opportunities and challenges. Since theory and methods evolve, so will research programmes - often tracking opportunity. Here, we describe a research programme where we have investigated the population biology of grayling Thymallus thymallus in a Norwegian alpine landscape over three decades. Starting with classical ecological studies, we identified a set of populations that had evolved population-specific phenotypic traits over a relatively short time span (10-30 generations). These observations led us into evolutionary studies at various levels of biological organization, using population and quantitative genetic, transcriptomic and proteomic approaches. Overall, the results show that the populations exhibit evolutionary responses to local-scale differences in environment (mainly water temperature during early development). Further, plastic responses are important in the early phase of population diversification. Population genomic studies are now becoming possible following the completion of an annotated genome. This will help us and others in addressing questions about the genetic architecture of traits important for local adaptation, thus emphasizing that combining ecological and evolutionary approaches is more important and interesting than ever. © 2019 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2019.

While diadromy may promote gene flow leading to a lack of genetic differentiation among populations, resident populations tend to be affected by local adaptation and/or plasticity. Studies on these effects on genomic divergence in nonmodel amphidromous species are scarce. Galaxias maculatus, one of the most widespread fish species in the Southern Hemisphere, exhibits two life histories, an ancestral diadromous, specifically, amphidromous form, and a derived freshwater resident form. We examined the genetic diversity and divergence among 20 estuarine and resident populations across the Chilean distribution of G. maculatus and assessed the extent to which selection is involved in the differentiation among resident populations. We obtained nearly 4,400 SNP markers using a RADcap approach for 224 individuals. As expected, collections from estuarine locations typically consist of diadromous individuals. Diadromous populations are highly differentiated from their resident counterparts by both neutral and putative adaptive markers. While diadromous populations exhibit high gene flow and lack site fidelity, resident populations appear to be the product of different colonization events with relatively low genetic diversity and varying levels of gene flow. In particular, the northernmost resident populations were clearly genetically distinct and reproductively isolated from each other suggesting local adaptation.

These patterns may be driven by natural selection over spatial environmental gradients, but can also be shaped by gene flow, especially in marine taxa with high dispersal potential. Understanding and predicting organismal responses to warming requires disentangling the opposing effects of selection and gene flow. We begin by documenting genetic divergence of thermal tolerance and developmental phenotypic plasticity. Ten populations of the widespread copepod Acartia tonsa were collected from sites across a large thermal gradient, ranging from the Florida Keys to Northern New Brunswick, Canada (spanning over 20° latitude). Thermal performance curves (TPCs) from common garden experiments revealed local adaptation at the sampling range extremes, with thermal tolerance increasing at low latitudes and decreasing at high latitudes. The opposite pattern was observed in phenotypic plasticity, which was strongest at high latitudes. No relationship was observed between phenotypic plasticity and environmental variables. Instead, the results are consistent with the hypothesis of a trade-off between thermal tolerance and the strength of phenotypic plasticity. Over a large portion of the sampled range, however, we observed a remarkable lack of differentiation of TPCs. To examine whether this lack of divergence is the result of selection for a generalist performance curve or constraint by gene flow, we analyzed cytochrome oxidase I mtDNA sequences, which revealed four distinct genetic clades, abundant genetic diversity, and widely distributed haplotypes. Strong divergence in thermal performance within genetic clades, however, suggests that the pace of thermal adaptation can be relatively rapid. The combined insight from the laboratory physiological experiments and genetic data indicate that gene flow constrains differentiation of TPCs. This balance between gene flow and selection has implications for patterns of vulnerability to warming. Taking both genetic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity into account, our results suggest that local adaptation does not increase vulnerability to warming, and that low-latitude populations in general may be more vulnerable to predicted temperature change over the next century. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","climate change; climate variability hypothesis; copepod; gene flow; local adaptation; macrophysiology; phenotypic plasticity; plankton; rapid adaptation; thermal performance","climate change; climate variation; gene flow; global warming; integrated approach; local adaptation; phenotypic plasticity; plankton; population genetics; temperature gradient; vulnerability; Canada; Florida Keys; Florida [United States]; New Brunswick; United States; Acartia tonsa; Copepoda; adaptation; animal; Canada; copepod; Florida; population genetics; temperature; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Canada; Copepoda; Florida; Genetics, Population; Temperature",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus

Recent models demonstrate that stable epigenetic modifications of gene expression that occur more frequently than genetic mutations can both help and hinder adaptation in panmictic populations. However, these models do not consider interactions between epimutations and evolutionary forces in peripheral populations. Here, we use mainland–island mathematical models and simulations to explore how the faster rate of epigenetic mutation compared to genetic mutations interacts with migration, selection and genetic drift to affect adaptation in peripheral populations. Our model focuses on cases where epigenetic marks are stably inherited. In a large peripheral population, where the effect of genetic drift is negligible, our analyses suggest that epimutations with random fitness impacts that occur at rates as high as 10–3 increase local adaptation when migration is strong enough to overwhelm divergent selection. When migration is weak relative to selection and epimutations with random fitness impacts decrease adaptation, we find epigenetic modifications must be highly adaptively biased to enhance adaptation. Finally, in small peripheral populations, where genetic drift is strong, epimutations contribute to adaptation under a wider range of evolutionary conditions. Overall, our results suggest that epimutations can change outcomes of adaptation in peripheral populations, which has implications for understanding conservation and range expansions and contractions, especially of small populations. © 2019 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

This uniquely dense coat led to the near-extinction of sea otters during the 18th-20th century fur trade and an extreme population bottleneck. We used the de novo genome of the southern sea otter (E. l. nereis) to reconstruct its evolutionary history, identify genes influencing aquatic adaptation, and detect signals of population bottlenecks. We compared the genome of the southern sea otter with the tropical freshwater-living giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis) to assess common and divergent genomic trends between otter species, and with the closely related northern sea otter (E. l. kenyoni) to uncover population-level trends. We found signals of positive selection in genes related to aquatic adaptations, particularly limb development and polygenic selection on genes related to hair follicle development. We found extensive pseudogenization of olfactory receptor genes in both the sea otter and giant otter lineages, consistent with patterns of sensory gene loss in other aquatic mammals. At the population level, the southern sea otter and the northern sea otter showed extremely low genomic diversity, signals of recent inbreeding, and demographic histories marked by population declines. These declines may predate the fur trade and appear to have resulted in an increase in putatively deleterious variants that could impact the future recovery of the sea otter. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

They are found in most bodies of water, including those that pose extreme challenges, such as sulfide springs, rivers contaminated with heavy metals and organic pollutants, and caves without light. Adaptation to these extreme environments usually occurs rapidly, which has stimulated much interest in uncovering the genetic basis of such rapid adaptation. Since the sequencing of the zebrafish genome in 2001, rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technology has facilitated the additional sequencing of ~ 210 ray-finned fish genomes to date. As a result of this wealth of resources, much attention has been focused on the genetic basis of adaptation in fishes, particularly in extreme environments. The goal of this review is to summarize recent advances in fish genomics, with a specific focus on the use of genomic data to understand the genetic basis of adaptation to extreme environments in fishes. The results highlight that fishes often adapt to extreme environments through phenotypic and physiological changes that have a confirmed or inferred genetic basis. Moreover, such changes are usually rapid and repeated when parallel adaptation to similar extreme environments occurs. Specifically, parallel genetic changes are usually observed at both the intra- and interspecific level. The advances in fish genomics provide the opportunity to understand how evolutionary changes feed back into ecosystems that are facing extreme environmental changes, as well as to advance our understanding of the repeatability and predictability of evolutionary response (of fishes) to extreme environmental changes. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Adaptation; Comparative genomics; Extreme environment; Parallelism; Population genomics","adaptation; comparative study; cyprinid; extreme event; fish; genomics; population genetics; species diversity; Actinopterygii; Danio rerio; Pisces; Vertebrata",Review,"",Scopus

These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, since genetic change can establish similar phenotypes to plasticity. This connection between both mechanisms raises the question of how much of the variation observed between species or populations is plastic and how much of it is genetic. In this study, we used a structured population of fire salamanders (Salamandra salamandra), in which two subpopulations differ in terms of physiology, genetics, mate-, and habitat preferences. Our goal was to identify candidate genes for differential habitat adaptation in this system, and to explore the degree of plasticity compared to local adaptation. We therefore performed a reciprocal transfer experiment of stream-and pond-originated salamander larvae and analyzed changes in morphology and transcriptomic profile (using species-specific microarrays). We observed that stream-and pond-originated individuals diverge in morphology and gene expression. For instance, pond-originated larvae have larger gills, likely to cope with oxygen-poor ponds. When transferred to streams, pond-originated larvae showed a high degree of plasticity, resembling the morphology and gene expression of stream-originated larvae (reversion); however the same was not found for stream-originated larvae when transferred to ponds, where the expression of genes related to reduction-oxidation processes was increased, possibly to cope with environmental stress. The lack of symmetrical responses between transplanted animals highlights the fact that the adaptations are not fully plastic and that some level of local adaptation has already occurred in this population.

The roles of paleogeographic events and nature selection in speciation process often are under focus of research. We studied genetic diversity of anadromous and resident tapertail anchovies (Coilia nasus species complex) in the Yangtze River Basin using 4,434 nuclear loci, and tested the history of freshwater invasion of C. nasus. We found that both C. brachygnathus and C. nasus were valid species, but the resident C. nasus taihuensis and the anadromous C. nasus were not different genetically based on Bayes factor species delimitation (BFD*). Maximum likelihood tree, Network, PCA and STRUCTURE analyses all corroborated the results of BFD*. Two independent freshwater invasion events of C. nasus were supported, with the first event occurring around 4.07 Ma and the second happened around 3.2 Ka. The time of the two freshwater invasions is consistent with different paleogeographic events. Estimation showed that gene flow was higher within ecotypes than between different ecotypes. F-DIST analyses identified 120 disruptive outliers by comparing C. brachygnathus to anadromous C. nasus, and 21 disruptive outliers by comparing resident C. nasus to anadromous C. nasus. Nine outliers were found to be common between the two comparisons, indicating that independent freshwater invasion of C. nasus might involve similar molecular pathways. The results of this study suggest that adaptation to landlocked freshwater environment of migratory fish can evolve multiple times independently, and morphology of landlocked ecotypes may cause confusion in their taxonomy. © 2019 The Authors.

Its wide distribution ranges from temperate waters in the Atlantic coast of South America (39°S, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina) to the Sub-Antarctic environment of Cape Horn (56°S). A previous study has shown significant intraspecific differences on growth parameters and otolith morphology between the southern peripheral population of O. nigricans in the Beagle Channel and the populations in the Atlantic coast of Tierra del Fuego. In this work, we report the first data on population genetics of O. nigricans along the southern part of its distributional range, including the peripheral populations of Beagle Channel. To examine the genetic variability, we analyzed 224 sequences of 815 bp of mitochondrial control region generated from individuals captured at two sites in the Beagle Channel and six sites at the Atlantic coast. The genetic structure assessment revealed a sharp phylogeographic division between Beagle Channel and the Atlantic coast of Patagonia with a 39.83% of variance among groups. The observed genetic diversity was lower in Beagle Channel than in the Atlantic coast sites and the demographic analyses are compatible with a scenario of past population expansion, especially in Beagle Channel. We hypothesize two possible scenarios: one is a recent colonization of the Beagle Channel from the Atlantic Coast followed by divergence promoted by adaptation to local conditions. On the other hand, population differentiation may have been attained or initiated in allopatric conditions during Quaternary glacial phases and the populations may now be experiencing a secondary contact near the eastern tip of Tierra del Fuego. These hypotheses should be addressed in the future with genomics tools. By now, these populations should be considered as different units for conservation and management purposes. © 2019","Atherinomorpha; Biogeography; Genetic; Silversides; Speciation","biogeography; genetic analysis; genetic structure; growth; local adaptation; phylogeography; population genetics; range expansion; speciation (biology); Argentina; Atlantic Coast [South America]; Beagle Channel; Buenos Aires [Argentina]; Patagonia; Tierra del Fuego [(PRV) Argentina]; Argentina elongata; Atheriniformes; Atherinomorpha; Odontesthes nigricans",Article,"",Scopus

We used double-digest restriction-side associated DNA (RAD) sequencing to evaluate shifts in genome-wide genetic diversity and investigate the presence of parallel evolution associated with urban-specific selection factors in wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus). Our replicated paired study design involved 12 individuals from each of 4 rural and urban populations to improve our confidence that detected signals of selection are indeed associated with urbanization. Genetic diversity measures were less for urban populations; however, the effect size was small, suggesting little biological consequence. Using an FST outlier approach, we identified 37 of 8344 genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms with consistent evidence of directional selection across replicates. A genome-wide association study analysis detected modest support for an association between environment type and 12 of the 37 FST outlier loci. Discriminant analysis of principal components using the 37 FST outlier loci produced correct reassignment for 87.5% of rural samples and 93.8% of urban samples. Eighteen of the 37 FST outlier loci mapped to the American bullfrog (Rana [Lithobates] catesbeiana) genome, although none were in coding regions.

RNA-sequencing studies have successfully characterized gene expression differences among populations experiencing divergent environmental conditions in a wide variety of taxa. However, few of these studies have identified transcriptomic signatures to multivariate, environmental stimuli among populations in their natural environments. Herein, we aim to identify environmental and sex-driven patterns of gene expression in the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii), a critically endangered species that occupies a heterogeneous environment. We performed RNA-sequencing on ear tissue biopsies from adult male and female devils from three populations at the extremes of their geographic range. There were no transcriptome-wide patterns of differential gene expression that would be suggestive of significant, environmentally-driven transcriptomic responses. The general lack of transcriptome-wide variation in gene expression levels across the devil’s geographic range is consistent with previous studies that documented low levels of genetic variation in the species. However, genes previously implicated in local adaptation to abiotic environment in devils were enriched for differentially expressed genes. Additionally, three modules of co-expressed genes were significantly associated with either population of origin or sex. © 2019 by the authors.

Escaped aquaculture fish can cause unintended fitness and demographic consequences for their wild conspecifics through interbreeding and competition. Escape events from different sources exhibit great heterogeneity in their frequencies and magnitudes, ranging from rare but large spillover during a storm, to continuous low-level leakage caused by operational errors. The timescale of escape events determines the distribution of gene flow from aquaculture to the wild. The evolutionary consequences of this variation in timescale will depend on the degree of generation overlap and the focal species’ life history attributes, especially those under selection in aquaculture (e.g., growth rate, which can influence additional demographically important traits such as age at maturity). To evaluate the effects of variable escape both within and across generations, we construct an age-structured model of coupled genetic and demographic dynamics and parameterize it for species with contrasting life history characteristics (Salmo salar and Gadus morhua). Our results are consistent with earlier discrete-generation models that constant, low-level spillover can have a greater impact than rare, large pulses of leakage, even after accounting for the averaging effects of overlapping generations. The age-structured model also allows detailed evaluation of the role of different life history traits, which reveals that species with longer generation times might experience greater fitness consequences of aquaculture spillover but are less sensitive to variability in spillover. Additionally, environment-induced earlier maturity of escapees can increase the fitness effects on wild fish, especially those with shorter generation times. Our results suggest that effective management to minimize the unintended fitness consequences of aquaculture releases might require extensive monitoring efforts on constant, low-level spillover and assessment of the focal species’ life history characteristics. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Age structure; Aquaculture; Gadus morhua; Gene flow; Life history; Salmo salar","adaptation; aquaculture industry; captive population; demographic history; fitness; gadoid fishery; gene flow; heterogeneity; life history; local adaptation; salmonid; temporal variation; wild population; Gadus morhua; Salmo salar; animal; aquaculture; fish; fishery; gene flow; genetics; life history trait; statistical model; Animals; Aquaculture; Fisheries; Fishes; Gene Flow; Life History Traits; Models, Statistical",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus

A double inversion located on chromosome 5 in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is associated with life history development in multiple populations, but the importance of this inversion has not been thoroughly tested in conjunction with other polymorphisms in the genome. To that end, we used a high-density SNP chip to genotype 192 F1 migratory and resident rainbow trout and focused our analyses to determine whether this inversion is important in life history development in a well-studied population of rainbow trout from Southeast Alaska. We identified 4,994 and 436 SNPs–predominantly outside of the inversion region–associated with life history development in the migrant and resident familial lines, respectively. Although F1 samples showed genomic patterns consistent with the double inversion on chromosome 5 (reduced observed and expected heterozygosity and an increase in linkage disequilibrium), we found no statistical association between the inversion and life history development. Progeny produced by crossing resident trout and progeny produced by crossing migrant trout both consisted of a mix of migrant and resident individuals, irrespective of the individuals’ inversion haplotype on chromosome 5. This suggests that although the inversion is present at a low frequency, it is not strongly associated with migration as it is in populations of Oncorhynchus mykiss from lower latitudes.

The striking success of the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, to invade temperate regions has been attributed to the winter survival of diapause eggs in cold environments. In this study, we evaluate genetic polymorphisms (SNPs) and wing morphometric variation among three biogeographical regions of the native range of A. albopictus. Reconstructed demographic histories of populations show an initial expansion in Southeast Asia and suggest that marine regression during late Pleistocene and climate warming after the last glacial period favored expansion of populations in southern and northern regions, respectively. Searching for genomic signatures of selection, we identified significantly differentiated SNPs among which several are located in or within 20 kb distance from candidate genes for cold adaptation. These genes involve cellular and metabolic processes and several of them have been shown to be differentially expressed under diapausing conditions. The three biogeographical regions also differ for wing size and shape, and wing size increases with latitude supporting Bergmann's rule. Adaptive genetic and morphometric variation observed along the climatic gradient of A. albopictus native range suggests that colonization of northern latitudes promoted adaptation to cold environments prior to its worldwide invasion. © 2019 The Author(s).

Four species of Gyrodactylus were recovered from the body surface of both host species. Morphometric analysis of Gyrodactylus spp. and Scleromystax spp. indicated that subpopulations of parasites and hosts could be distinguished from different sub-basins and locations, but the degree of morphological differentiation seems to be little related to geographic distance between subpopulations. Phylogenetic relationships based on DNA sequences of Gyrodactylus spp. and Scleromystax spp. allowed distinguishing lineages of parasites and hosts from different sub-basins. However, the level of genetic structuring of parasites was higher in comparison to host species. Evidence of positive selection in mtDNA sequences is likely associated with local adaptation of lineages of parasites and hosts.

Here, we provide empirical support for a negative effect of pollution on Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) population dynamics in coastal waters of Norway by combining unique time series of juvenile cod abundance, body size, environmental concentration of toxic contaminants and a spatially structured population dynamics model. The study shows that mercury concentration might have decreased the reproductive potential of cod in the region despite the general decline in the environmental concentration of mercury, cadmium and hexachlorobenzene since the implementation of national environmental laws. However, some cod populations appeared to be more resistant to mercury pollution than others, and the strength and shape of mercury effect on cod reproductive potential was fjord-specific. Additionally, cod growth rate changed at scales smaller than fjords with a gradient related to the exposure to the open ocean and offshore cod. These spatial differences in life-history traits emphasize the importance of local adaptation in shaping the dynamics of local wildlife populations. Finally, this study highlights the possibility to mitigate pollution effects on natural populations by reducing the overall pollution level, but also reveals that pollution reduction alone is not enough to rebuild local cod populations.

Comparisons of replicate lines show parallel allele frequency shifts that recapitulate responses to size-selection gradients in the wild across hundreds of unlinked variants concentrated in growth-related genes. However, a supercluster of genes also rose rapidly in frequency and dominated the evolutionary dynamic in one replicate line but not in others.

We focus on study systems for which information derived using genomic tools contradicts conclusions drawn from traditional fisheries science methodologies and assumptions. We further illustrate the non-intuitive interplay of genomics and ecology in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) owing to the recently detected genetic architecture of age at maturity in this species. To this end, we explore a salmon management strategy applied in Québec, Canada and find that management measures aimed at protecting large, old individuals can lead to unexpected and undesired outcomes.

Changes in the phenotype of an invasive species may also trigger variations in its community level impacts, which is an acceptable, yet unexplored aspect of invasion biology. Our study attempts to fill important knowledge gaps on the basic behavior and ecological interactions of invasive species. Parthenium hysterophorus, a widely distributed invasive alien species of tropical and sub-tropical regions, was evaluated for variations in its morpho-functional traits and ecological performance at a common spatial and temporal scale. Field surveys were conducted in Chandigarh, India, in five sites identified as invaded with P. hysterophorus. Individuals of P. hysterophorus randomly sampled from these sites, showed from trait analyses that the population is differentiated into two morphotypes, P A and P B . Morphotype P B exhibits traits comparable to the shrub life-form in terms of woody stem (with higher stem circumference [+32.26%], stem specific density [+128.57%], twig dry matter content [+25.15%]); profuse branching (+46.38%); larger canopy (+91.16%); and better reproductive output (+190.29%) compared to P A. P A , on the other hand, reflected herbaceous characteristics with greater leaf area (+67.58%) and higher content of chlorophyll (+21.92%) compared to P B . Based on these morphotypes, the plots were divided into three invasion categories: areas invaded by P A [IP A ], areas invaded by P B [IP B ] and uninvaded areas [UI]. Ecological indices and soil chemical properties were compared across IP A , IP B and UI. Shannon's index (p &lt; 0.001), evenness index (p = 0.008), and richness index (p &lt; 0.001) were significantly lower in IP B compared to IP A . UI areas were found to have higher soil pH, phenolics, organic matter, and concentrations of N, P and K, compared to IP A and IP B , but lower Ca and Mg. Results suggest that phenotypic variations within population of P. hysterophorus regulate its ecological impact on associated vegetation. Conservation managers would benefit from studying its invasion patterns and identifying the morphotype with higher ecological impact to prioritize management efforts. Monitoring these behavioral and ecological patterns in P. hysterophorus over the long-term may also help in anticipating challenges to preventive measures. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Ecological indices; Invasive; Morphotypes; Parthenium; Soil chemistry","calcium; chlorophyll; magnesium; organic matter; phenol derivative; phosphorus; potassium; sodium; ecological approach; ecological impact; herb; index method; introduced species; invasive species; morphotype; phenotype; soil chemistry; subtropical region; tropical region; Article; canopy; Chandigarh; community; ecology; evaluation study; evenness index; flowering; herb; introduced species; invasive species; leaf area; local adaptation; morphotype; nonhuman; parameters; Parthenium hysterophorus; phenotypic plasticity; phenotypic variation; plant stem; reproduction; richness index; Shannon index; shrub; soil acidity; soil chemistry; vegetation; woody stem; Asteraceae; biological variation; human; India; soil; Chandigarh; India; Parthenium; Parthenium hysterophorus; Asteraceae; Biological Variation, Population; Humans; India; Introduced Species; Soil",Article,"",Scopus

The Dead Sea Sparrow Passer moabiticus occupies a disjointed range, where the Israeli populations are considered peripheral and fragmented. The species is also thought to have undergone a recent range expansion. We aimed to describe the genetic and morphological variation of the Israeli populations and to determine the extent of gene flow among them. We expected that because of the small latitudinal gradient across Israel and the recent range expansion of the species that Dead Sea Sparrow populations would show no significant morphological adaptation to local environmental conditions, and that considerable gene flow would be taking place among populations. Our findings indicate the existence of gene flow, suggesting high connectivity among populations, but recovered no support for a recent range expansion, possibly due to insufficient time since expansion for mutations to have accumulated.

Genome-wide population surveys of both natural and introduced populations provide insights into genetic diversity, the evolutionary processes and the genetic basis underlying local adaptation. Grass carp is the most important freshwater foodfish species for food and water weed control. However, there is as yet no overall picture on genetic variations and population structure of this species, which is important for its aquaculture. Results: We used 43,310 SNPs to infer the population structure, evidence of local adaptation and sources of introduction. The overall genetic differentiation of this species was low. The native populations were differentiated into three genetic clusters, corresponding to the Yangtze, Pearl and Heilongjiang River Systems, respectively. The populations in Malaysia, India and Nepal were introduced from both the Yangtze and Pearl River Systems. Loci and genes involved in putative local selection for native locations were identified. Evidence of both positive and balancing selection was found in the introduced locations. Genes associated with loci under putative selection were involved in many biological functions. Outlier loci were grouped into clusters as genomic islands within some specific genomic regions, which likely agrees with the divergence hitchhiking scenario of divergence-with-gene-flow. Conclusions: This study, for the first time, sheds novel insights on the population differentiation of the grass carp, genetics of its strong ability in adaption to diverse environments and sources of some introduced grass carp populations. Our data also suggests that the natural populations of the grass carp have been affected by the aquaculture besides neutral and adaptive forces. © 2019 The Author(s).","Aquaculture; Diversity; Evolution; Grass carp; Population structure; SNP","animal tissue; aquaculture; Article; biological functions; controlled study; environmental factor; gene cluster; gene flow; gene identification; gene location; gene locus; gene sequence; genetic association; genetic selection; genetic variability; genetic variation; genome-wide association study; genomic island; genotype; grass carp; habitat selection; India; local adaptation; Malaysia; Nepal; nonhuman; population structure; principal component analysis; selective sweep; single nucleotide polymorphism; animal; carp; demography; genetics; genome; genotyping technique; molecular evolution; Animals; Carps; Demography; Evolution, Molecular; Genetic Loci; Genome; Genotyping Techniques; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Selection, Genetic",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

A primary household survey has been conducted to collect data on socio-demographic profile, livelihood strategy, health, food, water, social network, natural disaster and climate variation indicators, were selected for Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) and Livelihood Vulnerability Index-Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (LVI-IPCC) analyses to measure and compare the vulnerability of mouzas (administrative unit) currently suffering from frequent flooding, coastal erosion and embankment breaching on an annual basis. Secondary data collected from the Indian Meteorological Department, the Water Resources Information System of India and the Global Sea Level Observing System have been used to identify dynamics of climate change by employing statistical and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques. A GPS survey has been conducted to identify locations of embankment breaching, and satellite images obtained from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and U.S. Geological Survey (NASA USGS) Government website have been applied to shoreline and land use change detection, using a supervised maximum likelihood classification. The results indicate that the study area has experienced increasing temperature, changing precipitation patterns, rise in sea level, higher storm surges, shoreline change, constant land loss, embankment breaching and changing land use, which have had impact on vulnerability, particularly of poorer people. The LVI (0.48 to 0.68) and LVI-IPCC (0.04 to 0.14) scores suggest that the populations of Dhablat, Bankimnagar, Sumatinagar, Muri Ganga and Sibpur mouzas are highly vulnerable (LVI scores of 0.60 to 0.68 and LVI-IPCC scores of 0.11 to 0.14) to climate change both because the communities are more exposed to it, and because poor access to food, health facilities and water makes them extremely sensitive to it and lowers their adaptive capacity. The findings of this study could be crucial to framing further development and adaptation strategies relating to climate change, and to safeguarding the estuarine ecosystem and the vulnerable population. © 2019, Science Press, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","adaptation strategies; climate change; estuarine ecosystem; livelihood vulnerability index (LVI); vulnerable population","climate change; embankment; estuarine ecosystem; GIS; GPS; household survey; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; livelihood; local adaptation; maximum likelihood analysis; satellite imagery; strategic approach; vulnerability; India; Sagar Island; West Bengal",Article,"",Scopus

The multi-generational test consisted generally of a continuous Pb exposed set of organisms, plus an extra control set running simultaneously. To assess daphnids recovery after Pb exposure, some organisms from the sixth generation were transferred to clean media for three extra generations (recovery period; F6 to F9), while others were keep Pb exposed. All setups (control, Pb exposure and recovery period) were submitted to two different dietary regimes, the standard (3 × 10 5 cells/mL) and restricted food (1.5 × 10 5 cells/mL) regimes. To evaluate the effects of generational Pb exposure and food regimes, individual, functional and population related endpoints were assessed (number of offspring, body length and rate of population increase (r) and feeding rate (FR)). The tests were conducted on the first (F0) and last generations (F9). No differences were shown on number of offspring and feeding among F9 control and continuous Pb exposed D. magna, although a higher r was shown for F9 Pb exposed organisms. F9 Pb exposed D. similis also presented a higher r than F9 control, however, lethality was induced at high Pb exposure levels. At food restriction the patterns were opposite and D. magna died at high Pb exposure while Pb exposed D. similis was the only setup (compared to control and recovery period) to survive at high Pb exposure levels. Regarding the recovery period, D. magna (standard food) did not cope well with the Pb re-exposure and lethality was induced, while D. similis indicate a decreased Pb sensitivity (only setup that survived high Pb exposure levels). Under food restriction, both species presented a decreased Pb sensitivity and consequent failed recovery (possibly due to epigenetic changes). Both species presented similar patterns regarding generations. Organisms from F0 presented enhanced reproductive outputs in comparison to F9 and the contrary occurred to the FR (even in control organisms). Data show an acclimation under a generational Pb exposure, which could increase the population of adapted organisms in natural habitats. And, since there was not a full recovery after three generations in clean media, an indication of epigenetic changes for both species may also be considered. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Daphnids; Feeding rate; Lead; Multi-generation; Reproduction endpoints","lead; lead; crustacean; feeding behavior; functional change; lead; pollution exposure; population genetics; reproduction; acclimatization; animal experiment; Article; body height; chemical analysis; controlled study; Daphnia; Daphnia magna; Daphnia similis; diet; diet restriction; ecotoxicity; environmental exposure; epigenetics; feeding behavior; female; functional genomics; individual based population model; lethality; metal recovery; monophyly; newborn; nonhuman; physical sensitivity; population dynamics; progeny; survival rate; adaptation; animal; animal food; Daphnia; drug effect; genetic epigenesis; physiology; reproduction; species difference; toxicity; water pollutant; Daphnia; Daphnia magna; Daphnia similis; Daphniidae; Adaptation, Physiological; Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Animals; Daphnia; Epigenesis, Genetic; Lead; Reproduction; Species Specificity; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"",Scopus

The impacts of human activities on the genetic diversity and genetic adaptation to heterogeneous environments remain poorly understood in the marine realm. The roughskin sculpin (Trachidermus fasciatus) is a small catadromous fish, and has been listed as a second-class state protected aquatic animal since 1988 in China. To elucidate the underlying mechanism of population genetic structuring and genetic adaptations to local environments, RAD tags were sequenced for 202 individuals in nine populations across the range of T. fasciatus in China. The pairwise FST values over 9,271 filtered SNPs were significant except that between Dongying and Weifang. All the genetic clustering analysis revealed significant population structure with high support for eight distinct genetic clusters. Both the minor allele frequency spectra and Ne estimations suggested extremely small Ne in some populations (e.g.,Qinhuangdao,Rongcheng,Wendeng, andQingdao),which mightresultfromrecent population bottleneck. The strong genetic structure can be partly attributed to genetic drift and habitat fragmentation, likely due to the anthropogenic activities. Annotations of candidate adaptive loci suggested that genes involved in metabolism, development, and osmoregulation were critical for adaptation to spatially heterogenous environment of local populations. In the context of anthropogenic activities and environmental change, results of the present population genomic work provided important contributions to the understanding of genetic differentiation and adaptation to changing environments. © 2019 The Author(s).","Habitat fragmentation; Local adaptation; Population structure; RAD-seq; Trachidermus fasciatus","animal; China; ecosystem; genetics; metagenomics; Perciformes; population genetics; procedures; single nucleotide polymorphism; Animals; China; Ecosystem; Genetics, Population; Metagenomics; Perciformes; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Genes showing parallel marine-freshwater expression divergence are found near to adaptive genomic regions, show signatures of natural selection around their transcription start sites and are enriched for cis- regulatory control. For genes with parallel increased expression among freshwater fish, the quantitative degree of cis- and trans-regulation is also highly correlated across populations, suggesting a shared genetic basis.

When interpreting responses to warming species are often treated as a single physiological unit with a single species-wide thermal niche. This assumes that trailing edge populations are most vulnerable to warming, as it is here where a species’ thermal niche will be exceeded first. Local adaptation can, however, result in narrower thermal tolerance limits for local populations, so that similar relative increases in temperature can exceed local niches throughout a species range. We used a combination of common garden temperature heat-shock experiments (8–32 °C) and population genetics (microsatellites) to identify thermal ecotypes of northeast Atlantic range centre and trailing edge populations of the habitat-forming kelp, Laminaria digitata. Using upregulation of hsp70 as an indicator of thermal stress, we found that trailing edge populations were better equipped to tolerate acute temperature shocks. This pattern was consistent across seasons, indicating that between-population variability is fixed. High genetic structuring was also observed, with range centre and trailing edge populations representing highly distinct clusters with little gene flow between regions. Taken together, this suggests the presence of distinct thermal ecotypes for L. digitata, which may mean responses to future warming are more complex than linear range contractions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Heat shock; Laminaria digitata; Range-centre; Trailing-edge","climate change; ecotype; experiment; gene flow; kelp forest; local adaptation; niche; population genetics; protein; temperature tolerance; warming; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Northeast); Laminaria digitata",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

Montane animals escape warming conditions at low elevation by moving upslope, but may be physiologically constrained by conditions there. Effects of elevation were studied for montane populations of the leaf beetle Chrysomela aeneicollis, where allele frequencies at nuclear genes and the mitochondrion vary along latitudinal and altitudinal gradients. A population presence survey conducted along a steep altitudinal transect (1,600–3,800 m) from 1981 to 2018 revealed that populations expand to low elevation following wet winters and retreat during drought. Quantitative surveys of a 45-site population network conducted from 2012 to 2018 along multiple altitudinal transects show that when beetles are abundant, population size peaks at 3,135 m, highest altitude populations are at the southern edge of the range, and populations decline and extirpate during drought, especially at low elevation. To examine effects of elevation on measures of performance and fitness, beetles from a genetically introgressed population (Bishop Creek) were examined. In nature, fecundity of females transplanted along natural altitudinal transects was measured, as was thorax cytochrome c oxidase (CytOx) activity. To examine effects of environmental hypoxia independent of other factors limiting persistence at high elevation, development rate and activity of malate dehydrogenase (MDH) were measured for larvae reared under otherwise common garden conditions at low (1,250 m) and high (3,800 m) elevation. In nature, fecundity declined with increasing elevation, independent of air temperature. CytOx activity was higher at high than low elevation, especially for individuals possessing genotypes of southern origin. Laboratory-reared larvae with southern mitochondrial haplotypes developed equally well at both elevations, but larvae with northern haplotypes developed more slowly at high elevation. MDH activity showed a similar pattern, suggesting that slower development rates at high elevation may be due to reduction in metabolic rate. These findings suggest that physiological effects of environmental hypoxia may contribute to other factors known to restrict insects’ ability to persist at high elevation, ultimately disrupting associated ecological communities.

The distribution and genetic structure of koala populations has been heavily influenced by human actions, specifically habitat modification, hunting and translocation of koalas. There is currently limited information on population diversity and gene flow at a species-wide scale, or with consideration to the potential impacts of local adaptation. Using species-wide sampling across heterogeneous environments, and high-density genome-wide markers (SNPs and PAVs), we show that most koala populations display levels of diversity comparable to other outbred species, except for those populations impacted by population reductions. Genetic clustering analysis and phylogenetic reconstruction reveals a lack of support for current taxonomic classification of three koala subspecies, with only a single evolutionary significant unit supported. Furthermore, ~70% of genetic variance is accounted for at the individual level. The Sydney Basin region is highlighted as a unique reservoir of genetic diversity, having higher diversity levels (i.e., Blue Mountains region; AvHecorr=0.20, PL% = 68.6). Broad-scale population differentiation is primarily driven by an isolation by distance genetic structure model (49% of genetic variance), with clinal local adaptation corresponding to habitat bioregions. Signatures of selection were detected between bioregions, with no single region returning evidence of strong selection. The results of this study show that although the koala is widely considered to be a dietary-specialist species, this apparent specialisation has not limited the koala’s ability to maintain gene flow and adapt across divergent environments as long as the required food source is available. © 2018, The Author(s).",,"anthropogenic effect; biogeography; cluster analysis; environmental conditions; gene flow; genetic isolation; genetic marker; genetic structure; genetic variation; genomics; geographical distribution; human activity; hunting; local adaptation; marsupial; phylogenetics; reconstruction; specialist; taxonomy; Australia; Blue Mountains [New South Wales]; New South Wales; Sydney Basin; Metatheria; Phascolarctidae; Phascolarctos cinereus; animal; animal dispersal; classification; comparative study; ecosystem; environmental protection; evolution; genetic selection; genetic variation; genetics; genomics; koala; phylogeny; phylogeography; physiology; population genetics; Animal Distribution; Animals; Biological Evolution; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Genomics; Phascolarctidae; Phylogeny; Phylogeography; Selection, Genetic",Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus

Here, we used a hierarchical Q ST –F ST approach to separate the roles of adaptive and neutral processes in shaping phenotypic variation in moor frog (Rana arvalis) larval life histories along a 1,700 km latitudinal gradient across northern Europe. This species has colonized Scandinavia via two routes with a contact zone in northern Sweden. By using neutral SNP and common garden phenotypic data from 13 populations at two temperatures, we showed that most of the variation along the gradient occurred between the two colonizing lineages. We found little phenotypic divergence within the lineages; however, all phenotypic traits were strongly diverged between the southern and northern colonization routes, with higher growth and development rates and larger body size in the north. The Q ST estimates between the colonization routes were four times higher than F ST , indicating a prominent role for natural selection. Q ST within the colonization routes did not generally differ from F ST , but we found temperature-dependent adaptive divergence close to the contact zone.

Especially in heterogeneous metapopulations, a tight coupling between dispersal, population dynamics and the evolution of local adaptation is expected. In this respect, dispersal should counteract ecological specialization by redistributing locally selected phenotypes (i.e. migration load). Habitat choice following an informed dispersal decision, however, can facilitate the evolution of ecological specialization. How such informed decisions influence metapopulation size and variability is yet to be determined. By means of individual-based modelling, we demonstrate that informed decisions about both departure and settlement decouple the evolution of dispersal and that of generalism, selecting for highly dispersive specialists. Choice at settlement is based on information from the entire dispersal range, and therefore decouples dispersal from ecological specialization more effectively than choice at departure, which is only based on local information. Additionally, habitat choice at departure and settlement reduces local and metapopulation variability because of the maintenance of ecological specialization at all levels of dispersal propensity. Our study illustrates the important role of habitat choice for dynamics of spatially structured populations and thus emphasizes the importance of considering that dispersal is often informed. © 2018 The Authors","dispersal; eco-evolutionary dynamics; local adaptation; spatial ecology","dispersal; ecology; evolutionary biology; habitat selection; individual-based model; local adaptation; metapopulation; population dynamics; population size; spatial analysis; specialization; stabilization",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

When low population densities translate into low mate encounter rates, this should result in reduced mate choosiness. In a system with overall high mating costs for males (due to precopulatory mate guarding, called amplexus), we investigated amplexus re-establishment after separating mating pairs and presenting focal males with a novel, size-matched female. Male Gammarus roeselii from a low-density (LD) population spent significantly less time until amplexus re-establishment than males from a high-density (HD) site, suggesting reduced choosiness in LD males. We experimentally ruled out alternative explanations such as differences in locomotor activity or mate finding abilities. To further demonstrate independent evolutionary trajectories of our study populations, we examined divergence in morphology and found males to differ in several traits involved in mate assessment and mate guarding. Together, we report phenotypic divergence in behavioural and morphological traits that is probably driven by contrasting selective regimes arising from different population densities.

Nevertheless, the actual role of evolving plasticity in the responses of natural populations to climate change remains unresolved. Direct observations of evolutionary change in nature are rare, making it difficult to assess the relative contributions of changes in trait means versus changes in plasticity to climate change responses. To address this gap, this review explores several proxies that can be used to understand evolving plasticity in the context of climate change, including space for time substitutions, experimental evolution and tests for genomic divergence at environmentally responsive loci. Comparisons among populations indicate a prominent role for divergence in environmentally responsive traits in local adaptation to climatic gradients. Moreover, genomic comparisons among such populations have identified pervasive divergence in the regulatory regions of environmentally responsive loci. Taken together, these lines of evidence suggest that divergence in plasticity plays a prominent role in adaptation to climatic gradients over space, indicating that evolving plasticity is also likely to play a key role in adaptive responses to climate change through time. This suggests that genetic variation in plastic responses to the environment (G E) might be an important predictor of species’ vulnerabilities to climate-driven decline or extinction. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Cichlid fish species in Lake Victoria are a prime example of recent speciation events and a suitable system to study the adaptation and reproductive isolation of species. Results: Here, we report the pattern of genomic differentiation between two Lake Victoria cichlid species collected in sympatry, Haplochromis pyrrhocephalus and H. sp. ‘macula,’ based on the pooled genome sequences of 20 individuals of each species. Despite their ecological differences, population genomics analyses demonstrate that the two species are very close to a single panmictic population due to extensive gene flow. However, we identified 21 highly differentiated short genomic regions with fixed nucleotide differences. At least 15 of these regions contained genes with predicted roles in adaptation and reproductive isolation, such as visual adaptation, circadian clock, developmental processes, adaptation to hypoxia, and sexual selection. The nonsynonymous fixed differences in one of these genes, LWS, were reported as substitutions causing shift in absorption spectra of LWS pigments. Fixed differences were found in the promoter regions of four other differentially expressed genes, indicating that these substitutions may alter gene expression levels. Conclusions: These diverged short genomic regions may have contributed to the differentiation of two ecologically different species. Moreover, the origins of adaptive variants within the differentiated regions predate the geological formation of Lake Victoria; thus Lake Victoria cichlid species diversified via selection on standing genetic variation. © 2019 The Author(s).","Adaptation; Cichlids; Genomic islands of speciation; Population genomics; Speciation","biological development; cichlid; circadian rhythm; gene expression; gene flow; genetic structure; genomics; hypoxic conditions; reproductive isolation; sexual selection; speciation (biology); visual cue; East African Lakes; Lake Victoria; Cichlidae; Yssichromis pyrrhocephalus; animal; cichlid; gene flow; genetic polymorphism; genetics; genome; genomics; lake; nucleotide sequence; species difference; species differentiation; sympatry; Animals; Base Sequence; Cichlids; Gene Flow; Genetic Speciation; Genome; Genomics; Lakes; Polymorphism, Genetic; Species Specificity; Sympatry",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

This paper highlights the barriers and enablers to climate change-related adaptation experienced in some of Bengaluru’s informal settlements. The barriers described in the paper include economic, social, governance and information related issues that impede local actions and increase vulnerabilities. Enabling factors such as improving social and human capital, gaining formal recognition and most importantly support from agencies (e.g. local government, civil societies, and community leaders), help overcome some of the barriers or challenges. Hence, local level adaptation measures mainstreamed with local developmental agendas help address some of the structural causes of vulnerability.

Despite increasing empirical evidence that adaptive divergence can be triggered by one or a few large inversions, the degree to which widespread genomic regions under divergent selection are associated with structural variants remains unclear. Here we test for an association between structural variants and genomic regions that underlie parallel host-plant-associated ecotype formation in Timema cristinae stick insects. Using mate-pair resequencing of 20 new whole genomes we find that moderately sized structural variants such as inversions, deletions and duplications are widespread across the genome, being retained as standing variation within and among populations. Using 160 previously published, standard-orientation whole genome sequences we find little to no evidence that the DNA sequences within inversions exhibit accentuated differentiation between ecotypes. In contrast, a formerly described large region of reduced recombination that harbours genes controlling colour-pattern exhibits evidence for accentuated differentiation between ecotypes, which is consistent with differences in the frequency of colour-pattern morphs between host-associated ecotypes. Our results suggest that some types of structural variants (e.g., large inversions) are more likely to underlie adaptive divergence than others, and that structural variants are not required for subtle yet genome-wide genetic differentiation with gene flow. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adaptation; ecological genetics; insects; population genetics - empirical","adaptation; animal; ecotype; genetic drift; genetic selection; genetic variation; genetics; genome; genomics; metagenomics; Neoptera; population genetics; procedures; Adaptation, Biological; Animals; Ecotype; Genetic Drift; Genetics, Population; Genome; Genomic Structural Variation; Genomics; Metagenomics; Neoptera; Selection, Genetic",Article,"",Scopus

Analyses of neutral and outlier loci revealed three genetically distinct regional clusters: one in the Atlantic and two in the northern Gulf. Divergence in neutral loci indicated gradual genetic change and followed a linear pattern of isolation by distance. Divergence in outlier loci was at least an order of magnitude greater than divergence in neutral loci, and divergence between the regions in the Gulf was twice that of divergence between other regions. Discordance in patterns of genetic divergence between outlier and neutral loci is consistent with the hypothesis that the former reflects adaptive responses to environmental factors that vary on regional scales, while the latter largely reflects drift processes. Differences in basic habitat, initiated by glacial retreat and perpetuated by contemporary oceanic and atmospheric forces interacting with the geomorphology of the northern Gulf, followed by selection, appear to have led to reduced gene flow among red drum across the northern Gulf, reinforcing differences accrued during isolation and resulting in continued divergence across the genome.

Following 60 generations of evolution in large population sizes with competition for food resources, two distinct classes of lines representing different degrees of adaptive response emerged: a low-fitness class that exhibited minimal or no improvement compared to the gas-1 mutant ancestor, and a high-fitness class containing lines that exhibited partial recovery of wild-type fitness. Many lines that achieved higher reproductive and competitive fitness levels were also noted to evolve high frequencies of males during the experiment, consistent with adaptation in these lines having been facilitated by outcrossing. Whole-genome sequencing and analysis revealed an enrichment of mutations in loci that occur in a gas-1-centric region of the C. elegans interactome and could be classified into a small number of functional genomic categories.

We review recent studies that have incorporated intraspecific variation, a potential proxy for LA, into distribution forecasts, assess their strengths and weaknesses, and make recommendations for how to improve forecasts in the face of LA. The three methods used so far (species distribution models, response functions, and mechanistic models) reflect a trade-off between data availability and the ability to rigorously demonstrate LA to climate. We identify key considerations for incorporating LA into distribution forecasts that are currently missing from many published studies, including testing the spatial scale and pattern of LA, the confounding effects of LA to nonclimatic or biotic drivers, and the need to incorporate empirically based dispersal or gene flow processes. We suggest approaches to better evaluate these aspects of LA and their effects on species-level forecasts. In particular, we highlight demographic and dynamic evolutionary models as promising approaches to better integrate LA into forecasts, and emphasize the importance of independent model validation.

Interestingly, traits and abundances are also central to our understanding of phenotypic selection, suggesting that indirect effects may be extended to understand evolution in complex communities. Here we explore indirect ecological effects and their evolutionary corollary in a well-understood food web comprising a plant, its herbivores, and enemies that select for opposite defensive phenotypes in one of the herbivores. We show that ecological indirect interactions are mediated by changes to both the traits and the abundances of intermediate species and that these changes ultimately reduce enemy attack and weaken selection. We discuss the generality of the link between indirect effects and selection. We go on to argue that local adaptation and eco-evolutionary feedback may be less likely in complex multispecies food webs than in simpler food chains (e.g., coevolution).

Atlantic salmon are usually characterized by population structure at multiple spatial scales; however, this is not the case for tributaries of the Miramichi River in North America. To resolve genetic relationships between populations in this system and the potential for known chromosomal fusions to contribute to adaptation, we genotyped 728 juvenile salmon using a 50 K SNP array. Consistent with previous work, we report extremely weak overall population structuring (Global F ST  = 0.004) and failed to support hierarchical structure between the river's two main branches. We provide the first genomic characterization of a previously described polymorphic fusion between chromosomes 8 and 29. Fusion genomic characteristics included high LD, reduced heterozygosity in the fused homokaryotes, and strong divergence between the fused and the unfused rearrangement. Population structure based on fusion karyotype was five times stronger than neutral variation (F ST  = 0.019), and the frequency of the fusion was associated with summer precipitation supporting a hypothesis that this rearrangement may contribute local adaptation despite weak neutral differentiation. Additionally, both outlier variation among populations and a polygenic framework for characterizing adaptive variation in relation to climate identified a 250-Kb region of chromosome 9, including the gene six6 that has previously been linked to age-at-maturity and run-timing for this species.

However, this classification focuses on large rivers and fails to acknowledge the importance of small forest streams that flow through upland terra firme forests, known as igarapés. Igarapés are surrounded by a distinct floristic composition when compared to the floodplains and contribute with a much greater water load to the Amazon basin than the Amazon River itself. We assessed the importance of blackwater, whitewater, and igarapé water on spawning and habitat choice in Crenuchus spilurus, a small fish composed of distinct genetic lineages that occur in igarapés flowing to blackwater and whitewater systems. Lineages from igarapés connected to the Rio Negro (blackwater) and Amazon River (whitewater) basins have greater spawning success in igarapé water than in the water from their surrounding floodplain. Habitat choice trials showed active selection of igarapé water by both lineages. Our results indicate that the hydrochemical condition of igarapés shapes adaptation in the physiology and behavior of C. spilurus. We suggest expanding upon the current classification to include igarapés as a distinct water type and environment. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Choice experiments; Habitat type; Igarapé; Reproductive isolation","discrete choice analysis; fish; floodplain; floristics; forest ecosystem; gene flow; habitat type; hydrochemistry; local adaptation; reproductive isolation; spawning population; Amazon River; Rio Negro [South America]",Article,"",Scopus

Instead, selection from the standing genetic variation permits rapid adaptation via soft sweeps or polygenic adaptation. Empirical evidence of this process in nature is currently limited but accumulating. Results: We provide genome-wide analyses of rapid evolution in Fundulus heteroclitus populations subjected to recently elevated temperatures due to coastal power station thermal effluents using 5449 SNPs across two effluent-affected and four reference populations. Bayesian and multivariate analyses of population genomic structure reveal a substantial portion of genetic variation that is most parsimoniously explained by selection at the site of thermal effluents. An FST outlier approach in conjunction with additional conservative requirements identify significant allele frequency differentiation that exceeds neutral expectations among exposed and closely related reference populations. Genomic variation patterns near these candidate loci reveal that individuals living near thermal effluents have rapidly evolved from the standing genetic variation through small allele frequency changes at many loci in a pattern consistent with polygenic selection on the standing genetic variation. Conclusions: While the ultimate trajectory of selection in these populations is unknown and we survey only a minority of genomic loci, our findings suggest that polygenic models of adaptation may play important roles in large, natural populations experiencing recent selection due to environmental changes that cause broad physiological impacts. © 2019 The Author(s).","Adaptation; Fish; Polygenic adaptation; Population genomics - empirical; Selective sweeps","allele; fish; genetic analysis; genetic variation; genomics; local adaptation; natural selection; polymorphism; power plant; Fundulus heteroclitus; acclimatization; adaptation; animal; Bayes theorem; Fundulidae; gene frequency; genetic selection; genetics; genome-wide association study; genomics; heat; metagenomics; multifactorial inheritance; physiology; population genetics; single nucleotide polymorphism; Acclimatization; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Bayes Theorem; Fundulidae; Gene Frequency; Genetics, Population; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genomics; Hot Temperature; Metagenomics; Multifactorial Inheritance; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Selection, Genetic",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

In particular, lead exposure can act as a stressor to wildlife and cause negative effects on fitness. Any ability to adapt to stress caused by the negative effects of trace metal exposure would be beneficial for species living in contaminated environments. However, mechanisms for responding adaptively to metal contamination are not fully understood in free-living organisms. The Australian populations of the house sparrow (Passer domesticus) provides an excellent opportunity to study potential adaptation to environmental lead contamination because they have a commensal relationship with humans and are distributed broadly across Australian settlements including many long-term mining and smelting communities. To examine the potential for an evolutionary response to long-term lead exposure, we collected genomic SNP data using the house sparrow 200 K SNP array, from 11 localities across the Australian distribution including two mining sites (Broken Hill and Mount Isa, which are two genetically independent populations) that have well-established elevated levels of lead contamination as well as trace metals and metalloids. We contrast these known contaminated locations to other lesser-contaminated environments. Using an ecological association genome scan method to identify genomic differentiation associated with estimates of lead contamination we identified 60 outlier loci across three tests. A total of 39 genes were found to be physically linked (within 20 kbps) of all outliers in the house sparrow reference genome. The linked candidate genes included 12 genes relevant to lead exposure, such as two metal transporters that can transport metals including lead and zinc across cell membranes. These candidate genes provide targets for follow up experiments comparing resilience to lead exposure between populations exposed to varied levels of lead contamination. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Avian; Ecotoxicity; Lead exposure; Local adaptation; Passer domesticus","Animals; Contamination; Cytology; Genes; Houses; Lead smelting; Metals; Population statistics; Avian; Ecotoxicity; Lead exposure; Local adaptation; Passer domesticus; Trace elements; carrier protein; lead; metal transporter; trace metal; unclassified drug; zinc; lead; commensal; ecotoxicology; evolutionary biology; fitness; genome; lead; mining; passerine; trace metal; adaptation; adult; Article; Australian; cell membrane; commensal; contamination; controlled study; gene expression; gene identification; gene locus; genomics; invasive species; long term exposure; male; membrane transport; mining; nonhuman; Passer domesticus; population genetics; priority journal; single nucleotide polymorphism; soil pollution; urban area; adaptation; analysis; animal; Australia; ecotoxicology; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; genetics; physiology; pollutant; sparrow; toxicity; Australia; Broken Hill; Mount Isa; New South Wales; Queensland; Aves; Passer domesticus; Adaptation, Biological; Animals; Australia; Ecotoxicology; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Genomics; Lead; Mining; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Sparrows",Article,"",Scopus

Results of empirical studies examining the role of gene flow in an adaptive context, however, have largely been equivocal, with examples of opposing outcomes being repeatedly documented (e.g., local adaptation with high levels of gene flow vs. gene swamping). We compared neutral genomic and venom expression divergence for three sympatric pit vipers with differing ecologies to determine if and how migration-selection disequilibria result in local adaptation. We specifically tested whether neutral differentiation predicted phenotypic differentiation within an isolation-by-distance framework. The decoupling of neutral and phenotypic differentiation would indicate selection led to adaptive divergence irrespective of migration, whereas a significant relationship between neutral and venom expression differentiation would provide evidence in favor of the constraining force of gene flow. Neutral differentiation and geographic distance predicted phenotypic differentiation only in the generalist species, indicating that selection was the predominant mechanism in the migration-selection balance underlying adaptive venom evolution in both specialists. Dispersal is thought to be a stronger influence on genetic differentiation than specialization, but our results suggest the opposite. Greater specialization may lead to greater diversification rates, and extreme spatial and temporal variation in selective pressures can favor generalist phenotypes evolving under strong stabilizing selection. Our results are consistent with these expectations, suggesting that the equivocal findings of studies examining the role of gene flow in an adaptive context may be explained by ecological specialization theory. © The Author(s) 2018.

Spatially variable selection between marine and freshwater habitats has had a significant and heterogeneous impact on patterns of genetic variation across the genome of threespine stickleback fish. When marine stickleback invade freshwater habitats, more than a quarter of the genome can respond to divergent selection, even in as little as 50 years. This process largely uses standing genetic variation that can be found ubiquitously at low frequency in marine populations, can be millions of years old, and is likely maintained by significant bidirectional gene flow. Here, we combine population genomic data of marine and freshwater stickleback from Cook Inlet, Alaska, with genetic maps of stickleback fish derived from those same populations to examine how linkage to loci under selection affects genetic variation across the stickleback genome. Divergent selection has had opposing effects on linked genetic variation on chromosomes from marine and freshwater stickleback populations: near loci under selection, marine chromosomes are depauperate of variation, while these same regions among freshwater genomes are the most genetically diverse. Forward genetic simulations recapitulate this pattern when different selective environments also differ in population structure. Lastly, dense genetic maps demonstrate that the interaction between selection and population structure may impact large stretches of the stickleback genome. These findings advance our understanding of how the structuring of populations across geography influences the outcomes of selection, and how the recombination landscape broadens the genomic reach of selection. © 2019 by the Genetics Society of America.","Adaptation; Gasterosteus aculeatus; Linked selection; Population genomics; Recombination; Threespine stickleback","Article; gene locus; gene mapping; genetic linkage; genetic selection; genetic variation; nonhuman; population structure; priority journal; stickleback; adaptation; animal; ecosystem; genetic linkage; genetic polymorphism; genetic selection; genetics; genome; Smegmamorpha; species differentiation; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Ecosystem; Genetic Linkage; Genetic Speciation; Genome; Polymorphism, Genetic; Selection, Genetic; Smegmamorpha",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

Most methods designed to detect positive selection along sequenced genomes, however, use simplified representations of past histories as null models of genetic drift. Here, we present the first method that can detect signatures of strong local adaptation across the genome using arbitrarily complex admixture graphs, which are typically used to describe the history of past divergence and admixture events among any number of populations. The method—called graph-aware retrieval of selective sweeps (GRoSS)—has good power to detect loci in the genome with strong evidence for past selective sweeps and can also identify which branch of the graph was most affected by the sweep. As evidence of its utility, we apply the method to bovine, codfish, and human population genomic data containing panels of multiple populations related in complex ways. We find new candidate genes for important adaptive functions, including immunity and metabolism in understudied human populations, as well as muscle mass, milk production, and tameness in specific bovine breeds.

Three-spine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) are an excellent model for such studies, as they have repeatedly adapted to divergent habitats across the Northern hemisphere. Here, we use genomic, ecological and morphological data from 16 independent pairs of stickleback populations adapted to divergent lake and stream habitats. We combine a population genomic approach to identify regions of the genome that are likely under selection in these divergent habitats with an association mapping approach to identify regions of the genome that underlie variation in ecological factors and morphological traits. Over 37% of genomic windows are repeatedly differentiated across lake-stream pairs. Similarly, many genomic windows are associated with variation in abiotic factors, diet items and morphological phenotypes. Both the highly differentiated windows and candidate trait windows are non-randomly distributed across the genome and show some overlap. However, the overlap is not significant on a genome-wide scale. Together, our data suggest that adaptation to divergent food resources and predation regimes are drivers of differentiation in lake-stream stickleback, but that additional ecological factors are also important.

Analyses of geographical variations in venom composition have been done in several taxa such as wasps, spiders, scorpions, cone snails and snakes, but surprisingly never in parasitoid wasps, although their venom should constrain their ability to succeed on locally available hosts. Such a study is now facilitated by the development of an accurate method (quantitative digital analysis) that allows analyzing the quantitative variation of large sets of proteins from several individuals. This method was used here to analyse the venom-based differentiation of four samples of Leptopilina boulardi and five samples of L. heterotoma from populations along a 300 km long south-north gradient in the Rhône-Saône valley (South-East of France). A major result is that the composition of the venom allows to differentiate the populations studied even when separated by few kilometers. We further analyzed these differentiations on the populations (reared under similar conditions to exclude environmental variance) with a QST analysis which compared the variance of a quantitative trait (Q) among the subpopulations (S) to the total variance (T). We also used random forest clustering analyses to detect the venom components the most likely to be adapted locally. The signature of the natural selection was strong for L. heterotoma and L. boulardi. For the latter, the comparison with the differentiation observed at some neutral markers revealed that differentiation was partly due to some local adaptation. The combination of methods used here appears to be a powerful framework for population proteomics and for the study of eco-evolutionary feedbacks between proteomic level and population and ecosystem levels. This is of interest not only for studying field evolution at an intermediate level between the genome and phenotypes, or for understanding the role of evolution in chemical ecology, but also for more applied issues in biological control. © 2019 Mathé-Hubert, Kremmer, Colinet, Gatti, Van Baaren, Delava and Poirié.","Adaptive divergence; Antagonistic coevolution; Drosophila; Individual 1D SDS-PAGE; Leptopilina wasps; Local adaptation; Multivariate QST; Population proteomics",,Article,"",Scopus

R. Miracle. Some of her early studies anticipated the use of these rotifers as model organisms to test hypotheses in population and evolutionary ecology. This short review is aimed to stress the research she initiated at the University of Valencia. With this aim in mind, we enumerate and comment on (1) the biological and ecological features of rotifers that make them remarkable model organisms and (2) the research fields influenced by rotifer population biology. Among the latter, we selected some topics in order to illustrate how rotifer studies have contributed to our knowledge: phenotypic plasticity, competition and coexistence among cryptic species, the evolution of sex and complex life cycles, and aging. We deeply review studies on rotifer ecological genetics and evolutionary ecology with an emphasis on population studies conducted in eastern Spain and fostered by Professor Miracle. We conclude that rotifer populations harbor high local genetic diversity, with the occurrence of clonal selection during the planktonic growing season. Moreover, studies show that they have high population differentiation, which holds signatures of historical events (e.g., glacial refugia and posterior range expansion). Additionally, differential local adaptation occurs even among neighboring populations. Two remarkable conclusions are that (1) population differentiation in rotifers is most likely due to persistent founder effects rather than to “isolation by adaptation” and (2) rotifer populations can differentially adapt to the levels of environmental uncertainty in their respective localities. This occurs by adjusting the timing of sex and initiating sex and diapausing egg production earlier when populations inhabit localities with higher uncertainty. Related to environmental uncertainty but also to other environmental features (novel environments where recombination is needed to fuel natural selection, nutrient availability, etc.), experimental evolution studies have found that laboratory populations evolve quickly, allowing them to become easily adapted to new conditions. We suggest that rotifers should be used in the close future to address additional central hypotheses in evolutionary ecology as a result of the feasibility of experimental evolution and resurrection ecology on one hand and “omics” tools on the other hand. As specific topics for future research, we highlight the evolution of sex, speciation, eco-evolutionary dynamics and the regulation of complex life cycles in relation to environmental cues. © Asociación Ibérica de Limnología, Madrid.

This is because, unless models impose reductions in carrying capacity at species’ edges, the dominant effect of gene flow is to increase genetic variance and adaptive potential rather than swamping local adaptation. This allows the population to match even very steep changes in trait optima. We extend our previous simulations to explore two nonlinear models of ecological gradients: (a) a sigmoid (steepening) gradient and (b) a linear gradient with a flat centre of variable width. We compare the parameter conditions that allow local adaptation and range expansion from the centre, with those that permit the persistence of a perfectly adapted population distributed across the entire range. Along nonlinear gradients, colonization is easier, and extinction rarer, than along a linear gradient. This is because the shallow environmental gradient near the range centre does not cause gene flow to increase genetic variation, and so does not result in reduced population density. However, as gradient steepness increases, gene flow inflates genetic variance and reduces local population density sufficiently that genetic drift overcomes local selection, creating a finite range margin. When a flat centre is superimposed on a linear gradient, gene flow increases genetic variation dramatically at its edges, leading to an abrupt reduction in density that prevents niche expansion. Remarkably local interruptions in a linear ecological gradient (of a width much less than the mean dispersal distance) can prevent local adaptation beyond this flat centre. In contrast to other situations, this effect is stronger and more consistent where carrying capacity is high. Practically speaking, this means that habitat improvement at patch margins will make evolutionary rescue more likely. By contrast, even small improvements in habitat at patch centres may confine populations to limited areas of ecological space. © 2019 The Authors.

However, the actual recruitment of fish from Atlantic and Indian Ocean spawning populations into SAF waters is unknown. To address this knowledge gap, genomic analysis (11 101 SNPs) was performed on samples from Atlantic and Indian Ocean spawning sites, including SAF sites spanning the current stock boundary. Outlier loci conferred high discriminatory power to assignment tests and revealed that all SAF fish were assigned to the Indian Ocean population and that no Atlantic Ocean fish appeared in the SAF samples. Additionally, several Indian Ocean migrants were detected at the Atlantic spawning site demonstrating asymmetric dispersal and the occurrence of a mixed-stock fishery in Atlantic waters. This study highlights both the spatial inaccuracy of current stock designations and a misunderstanding of interactions between the underlying biological units, which must be addressed in light of local and global declines of the species.

To address the scale of local adaptation in Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), two generations of hybrids between temporally separated spawning segments were made in a population of pink salmon (O. gorbuscha) and compared with controls to evaluate the genetic architecture underlying adult migration time and to test for declines in marine survival that resulted from outbreeding depression. Bayesian mixed-effects models revealed that adult migration times in hybrid lines were intermediate to those of controls and that additive sources of genetic variation were significant, thereby indicating that local adaptation has acted on additive genetic variation in shaping this trait. Similarly, a line cross analysis revealed that an additive model best described the genetic architecture of adult migration time. In contrast, marine survival was generally similar between control and hybrid lines, which suggested that the effect of outbreeding upon marine survival was minimal at such a fine scale of genetic divergence. The implications of these results are that (a) local adaptation can facilitate genetic divergence of life history traits between proximate subpopulations; (b) artificial relaxation of natural barriers to gene flow can cause maladaptive shifts in life history traits; and (c) wild populations may harbour fine-scale adaptive variation that supports productivity and sustainability. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","biodiversity; local adaptation; marine survival; migration time; outbreeding depression; quantitative genetics","adaptation; Alaska; animal; Bayes theorem; biological model; female; genetics; male; population genetics; population migration; reproduction; salmonine; Adaptation, Physiological; Alaska; Animal Migration; Animals; Bayes Theorem; Female; Genetics, Population; Male; Models, Genetic; Reproduction; Salmon",Article,"",Scopus

We show that genomic changes underlying parallel phenotypic divergence followed a complex pattern of both repeatable differences and of differences unique to specific ecotype pairs, in which parallel changes in expression or sequence are restricted to a limited set of genes. Yet, the majority of divergent genes were divergent either for gene expression or coding sequence, but not for both simultaneously.

Genetic differentiation and/or local adaptation among populations are sometimes observed at small spatial scales. The marbled flounder (Pseudopleuronectes yokohamae) is a commercially important coastal species in Tokyo Bay, Central Japan, exhibiting different spawning phenology at a small scale. Using 30 highly polymorphic microsatellite loci, including the 16 new microsatellite loci developed in the present study, we estimated the genetic structure and demographic connectivity of specimens collected along Tokyo Bay in 2012–2013 and 2015–2016. F-statistics indicated a genetic differentiation between adult populations collected within and outside Tokyo Bay during both collection periods, but almost no difference was detected between the populations from the inner and outer parts of Tokyo Bay. Assignment tests directly estimated demographic connectivity between the inner and outer bays via larval dispersal and juvenile and adult migration. The average movement distance of marbled flounder was 13.1–29.6 km, with a maximum distance of 42.8–54.0 km. This movement distance contributed to the strong demographic connectivity between the inner and outer bays. Meanwhile, an indirect method using the isolation by distance (IBD) theory underestimated the average movement distance (5.0–7.8 km) because the isolated setting of Tokyo Bay resulted in a higher IBD slope.

Due to the magnitude of the spill and observed effects from previous spills, the ecological impacts were predicted to be catastrophic. While negative effects of petroleum hydrocarbon exposure to fish have been documented at the organismal scale, most studies of fish assemblages have noted few, if any, DWH impacts. Our understanding of DWH effects is therefore limited by a disconnect in results reported at different organizational levels. We used population genomic tools to test hypotheses about population-level DWH impacts to Gulf Killifish (Fundulus grandis) in coastal Mississippi. Fundulus grandis is one of the most abundant marsh species in the northern Gulf of Mexico, and along with the sister species F. heteroclitus, has served as a model for toxicology research. We collected genotyping by sequencing data from four populations of F. grandis (two oiled and two not) to test predictions about DWH-related gene flow, demographics, genetic diversity and evidence of selection. Mississippi populations of F. grandis showed clear genetic structure, but there were few indicators (e.g. reduced genetic diversity, lower Ne estimates) consistent with large-scale mortality or migration related to DWH oil. Only one estimate of effective population size was reduced in oil-exposed populations and of the twenty outlier loci only two were in regions with potential adaptive significance (i.e., immune functions). While the toxic effects of oil on F. grandis at the organismal level is well established, the minimal impacts we detected to populations along the Mississippi coast likely reflects the complexity of the northern Gulf of Mexico and DWH oil spill. However, we do recognize that the patchiness of oil exposure and low genome coverage of the data limit our ability to conclude there were no DWH effects on these populations. © 2018","Demographics; Fish; Gulf of Mexico; Outlier loci analysis; Population structure","adaptation; cyprinid; deep water; demography; ecological impact; effective population size; fish; genome; genomics; genotype; marine ecosystem; mortality; oil pollution; oil spill; outlier; petroleum hydrocarbon; pollution exposure; population migration; population structure; toxicology; Atlantic Ocean; Gulf of Mexico; Mississippi Basin; United States; Fundulus grandis",Article,"",Scopus

In California estuaries, O. lurida is adapted to local salinity regimes and populations differ in low salinity tolerance. In this study, oysters from three California populations were reared for two generations in a laboratory common garden and subsequently exposed to low salinity seawater. Comparative transcriptomics was then used to understand species-level responses to hyposmotic stress and population-level mechanisms underlying divergent salinity tolerances. Gene expression patterns indicate Olympia oysters are sensitive to hyposmotic stress: All populations respond to low salinity by up-regulating transcripts indicative of protein unfolding, DNA damage and cell cycle arrest after sub-lethal exposure. Among O. lurida populations, transcriptomic profiles differed constitutively and in response to low salinity. Despite two generations in common-garden conditions, transcripts encoding apoptosis modulators were constitutively expressed at significantly different levels in the most tolerant population. Expression of cell death regulators may facilitate cell fate decisions when salinity declines. Following low salinity exposure, oysters from the more tolerant population expressed a small number of mRNAs at significantly higher levels than less tolerant populations. Proteins encoded by these transcripts regulate ciliary activity within the mantle cavity and may function to prolong valve closure and reduce mortality in low salinity seawater. Collectively, gene expression patterns suggest sub-lethal impacts of hyposmotic stress in Olympia oysters are considerable and that even oysters with greater low salinity tolerance may be vulnerable to future freshwater flooding events. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","climate change; local adaptation; oyster; RNA-seq; salinity; transcriptome","transcriptome; adaptation; animal; California; estuary; genetics; Ostrea; population genetics; salinity; salt tolerance; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; California; Estuaries; Genetics, Population; Ostrea; Salinity; Salt Tolerance; Transcriptome",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus

Some recent genomics studies of anadromous Pacific salmonids have reported a strong association between alleles at one or a very few genes and a key life history trait (adult migration timing) that has played an important role in defining conservation units. Publication of these results has already spurred a legal challenge to the existing framework for managing these species, which was developed under the paradigm that most phenotypic traits are controlled by many genes of small effect, and that parallel evolution of life history traits is common. But what if a key life history trait can only be expressed if a specific allele is present? Does the current framework need to be modified to account for the new genomics results, as some now propose? Although this real-world example focuses on Pacific salmonids, the issues regarding how genomics can inform us about the genetic basis of phenotypic traits, and what that means for applied conservation, are much more general. In this perspective, we consider these issues and outline a general process that can be used to help generate the types of additional information that would be needed to make informed decisions about the adequacy of existing conservation and management frameworks.

Here, we assess patterns of population differentiation in expressed venom proteins in Northern Pacific rattlesnakes (Crotalus oreganus) from 13 locations across California. We evaluate the relative importance of major biotic (prey species community composition), abiotic (temperature, precipitation and elevation) and genetic factors (genetic distance based on RAD-seq loci) as correlates of population divergence in venom phenotypes. We found that over half of the variation in venom composition is associated with among-population differentiation for genetic and environmental variables and that this variation occurred along axes defining previously observed functional trade-offs between venom proteins that have neurotoxic, myotoxic and hemorrhagic effects. Surprisingly, genetic differentiation among populations was the best predictor of venom divergence, accounting for 46% of overall variation, whereas differences in prey community composition and abiotic factors explained smaller amounts of variation (23% and 19%, respectively). The association between genetic differentiation and venom composition could be due to an isolation-by-distance effect or, more likely, an isolation-by-environment effect where selection against recent migrants is strong, producing a correlation between neutral genetic differentiation and venom differentiation. Our findings suggest that even coarse estimates of prey community composition can be useful in understanding the selection pressures acting on patterns of venom protein expression. Additionally, our results suggest that factors other than adaptation to spatial variation in prey need to be considered when explaining population divergence in venom. © 2018 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

In Oman, the scalloped spiny lobster is currently treated as a single management unit (MU) or stock and there is an absence of information on the genetic population structure of the species that can inform management decisions, particularly at a fine-scale level. This work is the first to identify genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for P. homarus using Diversity Arrays Technology sequencing (DArT-seq) and to elucidate any stock structure in the species. Results: After stringent filtering, 7988 high utility SNPs were discovered and used to assess the genetic diversity, connectivity and structure of P. homarus populations from Al Ashkharah, Masirah Island, Duqm, Ras Madrakah, Haitam, Ashuwaymiyah, Mirbat and Dhalkut landing sites. Pairwise F ST estimates revealed low differentiation among populations (pairwise F ST range = - 0.0008 - 0.0021). Analysis of genetic variation using putatively directional F ST outliers (504 SNPs) revealed higher and significant pairwise differentiation (p &lt; 0.01) for all locations, with Ashuwaymiyah being the most diverged population (Ashuwaymiyah pairwise F ST range = 0.0288-0.0736). Analysis of population structure using Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC) revealed a broad admixture among P. homarus, however, Ashuwaymiyah stock appeared to be potentially under local adaptive pressures. Fine scale analysis using Netview R provided further support for the general admixture of P. homarus. Conclusions: Findings here suggested that stocks of P. homarus along the Omani coastline are admixed. Yet, fishery managers need to treat the lobster stock from Ashuwaymiyah with caution as it might be subject to local adaptive pressures. We emphasize further study with larger number of samples to confirm the genetic status of the Ashuwaymiyah stock. The approach utilised in this study has high transferability in conservation and management of other marine stocks with similar biological and ecological attributes. © 2018 The Author(s).","F ST outliers; Management unit; Population genetic structure; Scalloped spiny lobster; SNP","Article; controlled study; gene flow; gene sequence; genetic analysis; genetic variability; genome-wide association study; local adaptation; nonhuman; Oman; Palinuridae; Panulirus homarus; population genetic structure; single nucleotide polymorphism; adaptation; animal; genetic marker; genetics; genome; Palinuridae; population genetics; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Gene Flow; Genetic Markers; Genetics, Population; Genome; Palinuridae; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Variation in maturation timing occurs in steelhead trout, which has been associated with greb1L, an oestrogen target gene. Previous techniques that identified this gene only accounted for about 0.5-2.0% of the genome and solely investigated coastal populations, leaving uncertainty on the genetic basis of this trait and its prevalence across a larger geographic scale. Results: We used a three-tiered approach to interrogate the genomic basis of complex phenology in anadromous steelhead. First, fine scale mapping with 5.3 million SNPs from resequencing data covering 68% of the genome confirmed a 309-kb region consisting of four genes on chromosome 28, including greb1L, to be the genomic region of major effect for maturation timing. Second, broad-scale characterization of candidate greb1L genotypes across 59 populations revealed unexpected patterns in maturation phenology for inland fish migrating long distances relative to those in coastal streams. Finally, genotypes from 890 PIT-tag tracked steelhead determined associations with early versus late arrival to spawning grounds that were previously unknown. Conclusions: This study clarifies the genetic bases for disparity in phenology observed in steelhead, determining an unanticipated trait association with premature versus mature arrival to spawning grounds and identifying multiple candidate genes potentially contributing to this variation from a single genomic region of major effect. This illustrates how dense genome mapping and detailed phenotypic characterization can clarify genotype to phenotype associations across geographic ranges of species. © 2018 The Author(s).","Adaptation; Genome evolution; greb1L; Migration; Oncorhynchus; Pooled sequencing; Sexual maturation","chromosome; gene expression; genome; genomics; genotype; life history trait; phenology; phenotype; salmonid; sexual maturity; Oncorhynchus; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Salmonidae; animal; chromosome; evolution; genetic selection; genetic variation; genetics; genome; geography; haplotype; Oncorhynchus mykiss; phylogeny; physiology; population genetics; population migration; principal component analysis; single nucleotide polymorphism; statistical model; Animal Migration; Animals; Biological Evolution; Chromosomes; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Genome; Geography; Haplotypes; Likelihood Functions; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Phylogeny; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Principal Component Analysis; Selection, Genetic",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

For species inhabiting complex spatial environments however, it is unclear how the balance between gene flow and selection may be influenced by landscape heterogeneity and environmental variation. Here, we evaluated the effects of dendritic landscape structure and the selective forces of hydroclimatic variation on population genomic parameters for the Murray River rainbowfish, Melanotaenia fluviatilis across the Murray–Darling Basin, Australia. We genotyped 249 rainbowfish at 17,503 high-quality SNP loci and integrated these with models of network connectivity and high-resolution environmental data within a riverscape genomics framework. We tested competing models of gene flow before using multivariate genotype–environment association (GEA) analysis to test for signals of adaptive divergence associated with hydroclimatic variation. Patterns of neutral genetic variation were consistent with expectations based on the stream hierarchy model and M. fluviatilis’ moderate dispersal ability. Models incorporating dendritic network structure suggested that landscape heterogeneity is a more important factor determining connectivity and gene flow than waterway distance. Extending these results, we also introduce a novel approach to controlling for the unique effects of dendritic network structure in GEA analyses of populations of aquatic species. We identified 146 candidate loci potentially underlying a polygenic adaptive response to seasonal fluctuations in stream flow and variation in the relative timing of temperature and precipitation extremes. Our findings underscore an emerging predominant role for seasonal variation in hydroclimatic conditions driving local adaptation and are relevant for informing proactive conservation management. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","climate change; ddRAD-seq; dendritic networks; landscape genomics; Melanotaenia fluviatilis; Murray-Darling Basin","adaptation; animal; Australia; biological model; climate; ecosystem; fish; gene flow; genetic selection; genetics; genotype; multifactorial inheritance; population genetics; season; single nucleotide polymorphism; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Australia; Climate; Ecosystem; Fishes; Gene Flow; Genetics, Population; Genotype; Models, Genetic; Multifactorial Inheritance; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Seasons; Selection, Genetic",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus

In the past, analyses of local adaptation were restricted to few model species. Nowadays, due to the increased affordability of high-throughput sequencing, local adaptation can be studied much easier by searching for patterns of positive selection using genomic data. In the present study, we analysed effects of wastewater treatment plant and ore mining effluents on stream invertebrate populations. The two different anthropogenic stressors have impacted on stream ecosystems over different time scales and with different potencies. As target organisms we selected two macroinvertebrate species with different life histories and dispersal capacities: the caddisfly Glossosoma conformis and the flatworm Dugesia gonocephala. We applied a genome-wide genetic marker technique, termed ddRAD (double digest restriction site associated DNA) sequencing, to identify local adaptation. Ten and 18% of all loci were identified as candidate loci for local adaptation in D. gonocephala and G. conformis, respectively. However, after stringent re-evaluation of the genomic data, strong evidence for local adaptation remained only for one population of the flatworm D. gonocephala affected by high copper concentration from ore mining. One of the corresponding candidate loci is arnt, a gene associated with the response to xenobiotics and potentially involved in metal detoxification. Our results support the hypotheses that local adaptation is more likely to play a central role in environments impacted by a stronger stressor for a longer time and that it is more likely to occur in species with lower migration rates. However, these findings have to be interpreted cautiously, as several confounding factors may have limited the possibility to detect local adaptation. Our study highlights how genomic tools can be used to study the adaptability and thus resistance of natural populations to changing environments and we discuss prospects and limitations of the methods. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Metal mining; Population genomics; Positive selection; Wastewater treatment plants","Biochemistry; Chemicals removal (water treatment); Detoxification; Ecosystems; Effluents; Gene encoding; Ore treatment; Sewage pumping plants; Toxicity; Wastewater treatment; Water pollution; Water treatment plants; Anthropogenic stressors; Changing environment; Different time scale; Genomics; High-throughput sequencing; Metal mining; Positive selection; Wastewater treatment plants; Population statistics; copper; anthropogenic source; freshwater environment; genomics; macroinvertebrate; metal; mining; pollution effect; wastewater treatment plant; water pollution; arnt gene; Article; bioaccumulation; detoxification; Dugesia gonocephala; effluent; evolutionary adaptation; genetic selection; genomics; Germany; Glossosoma conformis; macroinvertebrate; mining; nonhuman; platyhelminth; population structure; positive selection; priority journal; waste water treatment plant; water pollution; xenobiotic metabolism; animal; aquatic species; genomics; insect; physiology; sewage; toxicity; Turbellaria; waste water; water pollutant; Dugesia gonocephala s. str.; Glossosoma conforme; Invertebrata; Platyhelminthes; Trichoptera; Animals; Aquatic Organisms; Genomics; Insecta; Mining; Planarians; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"",Scopus

However, conditions during transport – an early stage of the invasion – can be particularly harsh, thereby greatly reducing the size of a population available to establish in a new region. Some successful non-indigenous species are more tolerant of environmental and anthropogenic stressors than related native species, possibly stemming from selection (ie survival of only pre-adapted individuals for particular environmental conditions) during the invasion process. By reviewing current literature concerning population genetics and consequences of selection on population fitness, we propose that selection acting on transported populations can facilitate local adaptation, which may result in a greater likelihood of invasion than predicted by propagule pressure alone. Specifically, we suggest that detailed surveys should be conducted to determine interactions between molecular mechanisms and demographic factors, given that current management strategies may underestimate invasion risk. © The Ecological Society of America",,"biological invasion; fitness; invasive species; literature review; local adaptation; population genetics; propagule; selection; survival; transport process",Review,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

These listings relied heavily on evidence from other species that these populations were ‘discrete’ taxonomic units because little information was available for these species in PS. To fill this data gap, we collaborated with recreational fishing communities in PS to collect tissue samples and used population genetics analyses to determine whether samples from PS were genetically differentiated from samples collected from the outer coasts of the U.S. and Canada. Multiple analyses using restriction-site associated DNA sequencing data showed that yelloweye rockfish in PS and British Columbia, Canada were genetically different from coastal populations, while canary rockfish showed no genetic differentiation. These results support hypotheses that the genetic connectivity of rockfish populations is based on interactions between life-history characteristics and oceanographic conditions. These data also support the ESA designation status and the expansion of protected geographical boundaries for yelloweye rockfish but also suggest canary rockfish in PS are not a ‘discrete’ population and may not meet the first criterion of the ESA, as initially assumed.

Such ""contemporary ancestors"" can be used to demonstrate the effects of selection by comparing phenotypic and genetic divergence between the derived population and their extant ancestors. However, evolution and demography in these ""contemporary ancestors"" can complicate inferences about the source (standing genetic variation, de novo mutation) and pace of adaptive divergence. Marine threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) have colonized freshwater environments along the Pacific coast of North America, but have also persisted in the marine environment. To what extent are marine stickleback good proxies of the ancestral condition? Results: We sequenced &gt; 5800 variant loci in over 250 marine stickleback from eight locations extending from Alaska to California, and phenotyped them for platedness and body shape. Pairwise FST varied from 0.02 to 0.18. Stickleback were divided into five genetic clusters, with a single cluster comprising stickleback from Washington to Alaska. Plate number, Eda, body shape, and candidate loci showed evidence of being under selection in the marine environment. Comparisons to a freshwater population demonstrated that candidate loci for freshwater adaptation varied depending on the choice of marine populations. Conclusions: Marine stickleback are structured into phenotypically and genetically distinct populations that have been evolving as freshwater stickleback evolved. This variation complicates their usefulness as proxies of the ancestors of freshwater populations.

Many freshwater fishes have finely structured and locally adapted populations, but their natural genetic structure can be affected by river engineering schemes across river basins, fish transfers in aquaculture industry and conservation management. The European bitterling (Rhodeus amarus) is a small fish that is a brood parasite of freshwater mussels and is widespread across continental Europe. Its range recently expanded, following sharp declines in the 1970s and 1980s. We investigated its genetic variability and spatial structure at the centre of its distribution at the boundary of three watersheds, testing the role of natural and anthropogenic factors in its genetic structure. Results: Sequences of mitochondrial cytochrome B (CYTB) revealed that bitterling colonised central Europe from two Ponto-Caspian refugia, which partly defines its contemporary genetic structure. Twelve polymorphic microsatellite loci revealed pronounced interpopulation differentiation, with significant small-scale differentiation within the same river basins. At a large scale, populations from the Baltic Sea watershed (middle Oder and Vistula basins) were distinct from those from the Black Sea watershed (Danube basin), while populations from rivers of the North Sea watershed (Rhine, Elbe) originated from the admixture of both original sources. Notable exceptions demonstrated the potential role of human translocations across watersheds, with the upper River Oder (Baltic watershed) inhabited by fish from the Danube basin (Black Sea watershed) and a population in the southern part of the River Elbe (North Sea watershed) basin possessing a signal of admixture from the Danube basin. Conclusions: Hydrography and physical barriers to dispersal are only partly reflected in the genetic structure of the European bitterling at the intersection of three major watersheds in central Europe. Drainage boundaries have been obscured by human-mediated translocations, likely related to common carp, Cyprinus carpio, cultivation and game-fish management. Despite these translocations, populations of bitterling are significantly structured by genetic drift, possibly reinforced by its low dispersal ability. Overall, the impact of anthropogenic factors on the genetic structure of the bitterling populations in central Europe is limited. © 2018 The Author(s).","Cryptic invasions; Freshwater conservation; Game fish stocking; Gene flow; Human-mediated translocation; Phylogeography; Population genetics","bivalve; conservation management; crypsis; cyprinid; freshwater ecosystem; gene flow; genetic differentiation; genetic drift; genetic marker; genetic structure; genetic variation; human activity; local adaptation; mitochondrial DNA; phylogeography; population genetics; river basin; stocking density; translocation; watershed; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; Danube Basin; Elbe Basin; Elbe River; Europe; North Sea; Oder Basin; Poland [Central Europe]; Rhine Basin; Vistula Basin; Cyprinus carpio; Pisces; Rhodeus; Rhodeus amarus; fresh water; microsatellite DNA; mitochondrial DNA; animal; Bayes theorem; carp; Europe; gene frequency; genetic variation; genetics; geography; human; mitochondrion; North Sea; population genetics; river; species difference; Animals; Bayes Theorem; Carps; DNA, Mitochondrial; Europe; Fresh Water; Gene Frequency; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Geography; Humans; Microsatellite Repeats; Mitochondria; North Sea; Rivers; Species Specificity",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

The drivers selecting for local adaptation and the contribution of adaptation to genetic differentiation are often unknown. Restoration and succession studies have revealed different colonization patterns for Brachypodium retusum, a common Mediterranean grass. In order to understand these patterns, we tested population differentiation and adaptation to different environmental factors. Methods: Structured sampling of 12 populations from six sites and two soil types within site was used to analyze the spatial and environmental structure of population differentiation. Sampling sites differ in grazing intensity and climate. We tested germination and growth in a common garden. In subsets, we analyzed the differential response to stone cover, grazing and soil moisture. Key Results: We found significant differences among populations. The site explained population differentiation better than soil, suggesting a dominant influence of climate and/or genetic drift. Stone cover had a positive influence on seedling establishment, and populations showed a differential response. However, this response was not related to environmental differences between collection sites. Regrowth after clipping was higher in populations from the more intensively grazed Red Mediterranean soils suggesting an adaptation to grazing. Final germination was generally high even under drought, but germination response to differences in soil moisture was similar across populations. Conclusions: Adaptive population differentiation in germination and early growth may have contributed to different colonization patterns.

How long does diversification take and how much of the genome is affected? When divergence occurs in parallel from standing genetic variation, how often are the same haplotypes involved? We explore these questions using restriction site-associated DNA sequencing genotyping data and show that broad-scale genomic repatterning, fueled by copious standing variation, can emerge in just dozens of generations in replicate natural populations of threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus). After the catastrophic 1964 Alaskan earthquake, marine stickleback colonized newly created ponds on seismically uplifted islands. We find that freshwater fish in these young ponds differ from their marine ancestors across the same genomic segments previously shown to have diverged in much older lake populations. Outside of these core divergent regions the genome shows no population structure across the ocean–freshwater divide, consistent with strong local selection acting in alternative environments on stickleback populations still connected by significant gene flow. Reinforcing this inference, a majority of divergent haplotypes that are at high frequency in ponds are detectable in the sea, even across great geographic distances. Building upon previous population genomics work in this model species, our data suggest that a long history of divergent selection and gene flow among stickleback populations in oceanic and freshwater habitats has maintained polymorphisms of alternatively adapted DNA sequences that facilitate parallel evolution. © 2018 by the Genetics Society of America.","Contemporary evolution; Ecological divergence; Gasterosteus aculeatus; Population genomics; Threespine stickleback","Article; Gasterosteus aculeatus; gene flow; genetic variability; genome; haplotype; nonhuman; population genetics; population structure; priority journal; adaptation; Alaska; animal; DNA sequence; genetic selection; genetic variation; genetics; haplotype; molecular evolution; procedures; Smegmamorpha; Adaptation, Biological; Alaska; Animals; Evolution, Molecular; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Haplotypes; Selection, Genetic; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Smegmamorpha",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

The relation between mean TL and latitude was positive (r = 0.62) for South American populations; however, further studies are needed to determine whether it is this population’s life strategy, the local adaptation of a peripheral population or countergradient growth.

A previous study on the southern Japanese islands demonstrated that relative limb lengths of sika deer (Cervus nippon) were short on islands with steep slopes. We hypothesized that this morphological variation was evidence for local adaptation, and tested this hypothesis by comparing phenotypic divergence with neutral genetic divergence among eight populations of the sika deer in the southern Japanese islands. Divergence patterns differed between the phenotypic and neutral genetic features. Genetic similarity was high among individuals on Kyushu (OI, KGS, and KGK). Individuals on Tanegashima (TN) and Yakushima (YK) also constituted a group, whereas individuals on Tsushima (TS), Wakamatsujima (WM), and Kuchinoerabujima (KE) formed a genetically distinct group. Phenotypic data indicated that individuals from TS, OI, KGS, and KGK exhibited similarity, whereas individuals on YK formed an isolated group that was separated from the other populations. The degree of phenotypic divergence was larger than that of neutral genetic divergence between TN and YK. These results suggest that divergent selection worked between two of the eight island populations (TN and YK). The morphological trait of captive-bred individuals from TN and YK, which had never experienced their original environments, retained their original morphological features. By combining the results of multiple analyses, we found that the difference in relative limb length between the two populations was consistent with local adaptation hypothesis, although conclusive results were not obtained for the other populations. © 2018, The Society of Population Ecology and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","Adaptive evolution; Captive-bred animals; Genetic drift; Morphological differentiation","captive population; deer; divergence; evolutionary biology; experimental study; genetic variation; hypothesis testing; island biogeography; local adaptation; morphology; phenotype; Japan; Kagoshima [Kyushu]; Kyushu; Nagasaki [Kyushu]; Tsushima; Yakushima; Animalia; Cervus nippon",Article,"",Scopus

It is one of the most environmentally impacted brackish seas worldwide, and the low biodiversity makes it particularly sensitive to anthropogenic pressures including climate change. We applied a novel combination of models to predict the fate of one of the dominant foundation species in the Baltic Sea, the bladder wrack Fucus vesiculosus. Location: The Baltic Sea. Methods: We used a species distribution model to predict climate change-induced displacement of F. vesiculosus and combined these projections with a biophysical model of dispersal and connectivity to explore whether the dispersal rate of locally adapted genotypes may match estimated climate velocities to recolonize the receding salinity gradient. In addition, we used a population dynamic model to assess possible effects of habitat fragmentation. Results: The species distribution model showed that the habitat of F. vesiculosus is expected to dramatically shrink, mainly caused by the predicted reduction of salinity. In addition, the dispersal rate of locally adapted genotypes may not keep pace with estimated climate velocities rendering the recolonization of the receding salinity gradient more difficult. A simplistic model of population dynamics also indicated that the risk of local extinction may increase due to future habitat fragmentation. Main conclusions: Results point to a significant risk of locally adapted genotypes being unable to shift their ranges sufficiently fast considering the restricted dispersal and long generation time. The worst scenario is that F. vesiculosus may disappear from large parts of the Baltic Sea before the end of this century with large effects on the biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. We finally discuss how to reduce this risk through conservation actions, including assisted colonization and assisted evolution. © 2018 The Authors.

Indeed, inversions have been implicated in adaptation along environmental clines and in ecotype specialization. Here, we combine classical ecological studies and population genetics to investigate an inversion polymorphism previously documented in Europe among natural populations of the seaweed fly Coelopa frigida along a latitudinal cline in North America. We test if the inversion is present in North America and polymorphic, assess which environmental conditions modulate the inversion karyotype frequencies, and document the relationship between inversion karyotype and adult size. We sampled nearly 2000 flies from 20 populations along several environmental gradients to quantify associations of inversion frequencies to heterogeneous environmental variables. Genotyping and phenotyping showed a widespread and conserved inversion polymorphism between Europe and America. Variation in inversion frequency was significantly associated with environmental factors, with parallel patterns between continents, indicating that the inversion may play a role in local adaptation. The three karyotypes of the inversion are differently favoured across microhabitats and represent life-history strategies likely to be maintained by the collective action of several mechanisms of balancing selection. Our study adds to the mounting evidence that inversions are facilitators of adaptation and enhance within-species diversity. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

In this study, we used a dense SNP array to identify candidate loci potentially underlying fine-scale local adaptation within a large Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) population. By combining outlier, gene-environment association and haplotype homozygosity analyses, we identified multiple regions of the genome with strong evidence for diversifying selection. Several of these candidate regions had previously been identified in other studies, demonstrating that the same loci could be adaptively important in Atlantic salmon at subdrainage, regional and continental scales. Notably, we identified signals consistent with local selection around genes associated with variation in sexual maturation, energy homeostasis and immune defence. These included the large-effect ageat- maturity gene vgll3, the known obesity gene mc4r, and major histocompatibility complex II. Most strikingly, we confirmed a genomic region on Ssa09 that was extremely differentiated among subpopulations and that is also a candidate for local selection over the global range of Atlantic salmon. This region colocalized with a haplotype strongly associated with spawning ecotype in sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), with circumstantial evidence that the same gene (six6) may be the selective target in both cases. The phenotypic effect of this region in Atlantic salmon remains cryptic, although allelic variation is related to upstream catchment area and covaries with timing of the return spawning migration.

Dispersal provides connections within metapopulations, promoting demographic and evolutionary rescue, but may also introduce maladapted individuals, potentially lowering the fitness of recipient populations through introgression of heritable traits. To explore this dual nature of dispersal, we modify a well-established eco-evolutionary model of two locally adapted populations and their associated mean trait values, to examine recruiting salmon populations that are connected by density-dependent dispersal, consistent with collective migratory behaviour that promotes navigation. When the strength of collective behaviour is weak such that straying is effectively constant, we show that a low level of straying is associated with the highest gains in metapopulation robustness and that high straying serves to erode robustness. Moreover, we find that as the strength of collective behaviour increases, metapopulation robustness is enhanced, but this relationship depends on the rate at which individuals stray. Specifically, strong collective behaviour increases the presence of hidden low-density basins of attraction, which may serve to trap disturbed populations, and this is exacerbated by increased habitat heterogeneity. Taken as a whole, our findings suggest that density-dependent straying and collective migratory behaviour may help metapopulations, such as in salmon, thrive in dynamic landscapes. Given the pervasive eco-evolutionary impacts of dispersal on metapopulations, these findings have important ramifications for the conservation of salmon metapopulations facing both natural and anthropogenic contemporary disturbances. © 2018 The Authors.","Alternative stable states; Dispersal; Eco-evolutionary dynamics; Salmon metapopulations; Straying","density dependence; dispersal; evolutionary biology; fitness; local adaptation; metapopulation; migratory behavior; population dynamics; salmonid; social behavior; animal; animal dispersal; evolution; physiology; population density; population dynamics; population migration; salmonine; social behavior; Animal Distribution; Animal Migration; Animals; Biological Evolution; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Salmon; Social Behavior",Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus

Native herbivorous insects have been killed feeding on toxic exotic plants, which acted as 'ecological traps' 1-4 . We document a novel 'eco-evolutionary trap' stemming from the opposite effect; that is, high fitness on an exotic resource despite lack of adaptation to it. Plantago lanceolata was introduced to western North America by cattle-ranching. Feeding on this exotic plant released a large, isolated population of the native butterfly Euphydryas editha from a longstanding trade-off between maternal fecundity and offspring mortality. Because of this release - and despite a reduced insect developmental rate when feeding on this exotic - Plantago immediately supported higher larval survival than did the insects' traditional host, Collinsia parviflora 5 . Previous work from the 1980s documented an evolving preference for Plantago by ovipositing adults 6 . We predicted that if this trend continued the insects could endanger themselves, because the availability of Plantago to butterflies is controlled by humans, who change land management practices faster than butterflies evolve 6 . Here we report the fulfilment of this prediction. The butterflies abandoned Collinsia and evolved total dependence on Plantago. The trap was set. In 2005, humans withdrew their cattle, springing the trap. Grasses grew around the Plantago, cooling the thermophilic insects, which then went extinct. This local extinction could have been prevented if the population had retained partial use of Collinsia, which occupied drier microhabitats unaffected by cattle removal. The flush of grasses abated quickly, rendering the meadow once again suitable for Euphydryas feeding on either host, but no butterflies were observed from 2008 to 2012. In 2013-2014, the site was naturally recolonized by Euphydryas feeding exclusively on Collinsia, returning the system to its starting point and setting the stage for a repeat of the anthropogenic evolutionary cycle. © 2018 Macmillan Publishers Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",,"adaptation; butterfly; cattle; cooling; evolutionary biology; fecundity; introduced species; land management; local extinction; native species; oviposition; survival; thermophily; trade-off; Article; butterfly; Collinsia parviflora; ecological trap; egg laying; environmental aspects and related phenomena; environmental factor; ephemeral plant; Euphydryas editha; evolutionary adaptation; habitat quality; human; human activities; larval stage; microhabitat; mortality; natural selection; nonhuman; Plantago lanceolata; population density; priority journal; progeny; survival rate; wild species; adaptation; animal; bovine; domestication; evolution; female; growth, development and aging; herbivory; larva; North America; physiology; Plantago; Poaceae; species extinction; North America; Bos; Collinsia; Collinsia parviflora; Euphydryas; Euphydryas editha; Hexapoda; Papilionoidea; Plantago; Plantago lanceolata; Poaceae; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Biological Evolution; Butterflies; Cattle; Domestication; Extinction, Biological; Female; Herbivory; Human Activities; Larva; North America; Oviposition; Plantago; Poaceae",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

However, most studies are carried out in regions with distinct environmental gradients or across large geographical areas, in which local adaptation is expected to occur. Therefore, the focus of this study is to characterize genomic variation and selective signals over short geographic areas within a largely homogeneous region. To assess adaptive signals between microhabitats within the rocky shore, we compared genomic variation between the Cape urchin (Parechinus angulosus), which is a low to mid-shore species, and the Granular limpet (Scutellastra granularis), a high shore specialist. Results: Using pooled restriction site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing, we described patterns of genomic variation and identified outlier loci in both species. We found relatively low numbers of outlier SNPs within each species, and identified outlier genes associated with different selective pressures than those previously identified in studies conducted over larger environmental gradients. The number of population-specific outlier loci differed between species, likely owing to differential selective pressures within the intertidal environment. Interestingly, the outlier loci were highly differentiated within the two northernmost populations for both species, suggesting that unique evolutionary forces are acting on marine invertebrates within this region. Conclusions: Our study provides a background for comparative genomic studies focused on non-model species, as well as a baseline for the adaptive potential of marine invertebrates along the South African west coast. We also discuss the caveats associated with Pool-seq and potential biases of sequencing coverage on downstream genomic metrics. The findings provide evidence of species-specific selective pressures within a homogeneous environment, and suggest that selective forces acting on small scales are just as crucial to acknowledge as those acting on larger scales. As a whole, our findings imply that future population genomic studies should expand from focusing on model organisms and/or studying heterogeneous regions to better understand the evolutionary processes shaping current and future biodiversity patterns, particularly when used in a comparative phylogeographic context. © 2018 The Author(s).","Comparative phylogeography; Genomics; Local adaptation; Population differentiation; RAD-seq; SNP","article; biodiversity; DNA sequence; genomics; human; local adaptation; marine invertebrate; marine species; microhabitat; nonhuman; Patellogastropoda; phylogeography; population differentiation; restriction site; seashore; animal; evolution; gastropod; genetic variation; genetics; phylogeography; population genetics; sea urchin; species difference; Animals; Biological Evolution; Gastropoda; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Phylogeography; Sea Urchins; Species Specificity",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

We compared populations of J. singaporensis with that of the non-threatened, widespread, abundant, and eurytopic freshwater crab, Parathelphusa maculata, and found surprisingly high congruence between their population genomic histories. Based on 2,617 and 2,470 genome-wide SNPs mined via the double-digest restriction-associated DNA sequencing method for ~90 individuals of J. singaporensis and P. maculata, respectively, the populations are strongly isolated (FST = 0.146–0.371), have low genetic diversity for both species (also for COI), and show signatures of recent genetic bottlenecks.

Ocean temperatures are rising which triggers massive changes in water chemistry and thereby alters the living environment of all marine organisms. Studying adaptation, however, can be tricky because spatial genetic patterns might also occur due to random effects, for example, genetic drift. Genetic drift is reduced in very large and well-connected populations, such as in broadcast marine spawning organisms. Here, spatial genetic divergence is likely to be produced by selection. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Sandoval-Castillo et al. (2018) investigated patterns of spatial genetic divergence and their association with environmental factors in the greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata). This commercially important species of mollusc is a broadcast spawner with large population sizes, rendering genetic drift an unlikely factor in the genetic divergence of wild populations. Sandoval-Castillo et al. (2018) used a ddRAD genomic approach to test for genetic divergence between sampled populations while also measuring different environmental factors, for example, water temperature and oxygen content. The majority of identified SNPs was putatively neutral and showed only low levels of genetic divergence between field sites. However, 323 candidate adaptive markers were identified that clearly separated the individuals into five different clusters. These genetic clusters correlated with environmental clusters mainly determined by water temperature and (correlated) oxygen concentration. Gene annotation of the candidate SNPs revealed a large proportion of loci being involved in biological processes influenced by oxygen availability. The study by Sandoval-Castillo et al. (2018) in this issue of Molecular Ecology exemplifies the benefits of combining genomic studies with ecological data. It is a great starting point for more detailed (gene function, physiology) as well as broader (biodiversity) investigations that might help us to better understand adaptation and predict ecosystems’ resilience and resistance to environmental disturbances. In addition, this information can be applied to implement optimal conservation regime policies and sustainable harvesting strategies, hopefully protecting biodiversity as well as commercial interests in marine life. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"oxygen; adaptation; animal; gastropod; genomics; population genetics; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Gastropoda; Genetics, Population; Genomics; Oxygen",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus

Here we combine population genomics, biophysical modeling, and evolutionary simulations to predict future adaptation of the common coral Acropora millepora on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Genomics-derived migration rates were high (0.1–1% of immigrants per generation across half the latitudinal range of the GBR) and closely matched the biophysical model of larval dispersal. Both genetic and biophysical models indicated the prevalence of southward migration along the GBR that would facilitate the spread of heat-tolerant alleles to higher latitudes as the climate warms. We developed an individual-based metapopulation model of polygenic adaptation and parameterized it with population sizes and migration rates derived from the genomic analysis. We find that high migration rates do not disrupt local thermal adaptation, and that the resulting standing genetic variation should be sufficient to fuel rapid region-wide adaptation of A. millepora populations to gradual warming over the next 20–50 coral generations (100–250 years). Further adaptation based on novel mutations might also be possible, but this depends on the currently unknown genetic parameters underlying coral thermal tolerance and the rate of warming realized. Despite this capacity for adaptation, our model predicts that coral populations would become increasingly sensitive to random thermal fluctuations such as ENSO cycles or heat waves, which corresponds well with the recent increase in frequency of catastrophic coral bleaching events. © 2018 Matz et al.",,"Acropora millepora; allele; article; bleaching; climate; coral; evolutionary adaptation; genetic model; genetic parameters; genetic variation; genomics; heat tolerance; human; immigrant; latitude; metapopulation; migration; nonhuman; physical model; population size; prevalence; simulation; warming; adaptation; animal; Anthozoa; Australia; climate change; coral reef; environmental protection; genetics; genotype; physiology; temperature; uncertainty; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Anthozoa; Australia; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Coral Reefs; Genetic Variation; Genotype; Temperature; Uncertainty",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Genomic signatures of local adaptation in marine organisms are often driven by environmental selective agents impacting the physiology of organisms. With one of the highest salinity level, the Mediterranean Sea provides an excellent model to investigate adaptive genomic divergence underlying salinity adaptation. In the present study, we combined six genome scan methods to detect potential genomic signal of selection in the striped red mullet (Mullus surmuletus) populations distributed across a wide salinity gradient. We then blasted these outlier sequences on published fish genomic resources in order to identify relevant potential candidate genes for salinity adaptation in this species. Results: Altogether, the six genome scan methods found 173 outliers out of 1153 SNPs. Using a blast approach, we discovered four candidate SNPs belonging to three genes potentially implicated in adaptation of M. surmuletus to salinity. The allele frequency at one of these SNPs significantly increases with salinity independently from the effect of longitude. The gene associated to this SNP, SOCS2, encodes for an inhibitor of cytokine and has previously been shown to be expressed under osmotic pressure in other marine organisms. Additionally, our results showed that genome scan methods not correcting for spatial structure can still be an efficient strategy to detect potential footprints of selection, when the spatial and environmental variation are confounded, and then, correcting for spatial structure in a second step represents a conservative method. Conclusion: The present outcomes bring evidences of potential genomic footprint of selection, which suggest an adaptive response of M. surmuletus to salinity conditions in the Mediterranean Sea. Additional genomic data such as sequencing of a full-genome and transcriptome analyses of gene expression would provide new insights regarding the possibility that some striped red mullet populations are locally adapted to their saline environment. © 2018 The Author(s).","Adaptive genomics; Candidate genes; Genome scan; Mediterranean Sea; Mullus surmuletus; Salinity","suppressor of cytokine signaling 2; adult; Article; fish; gene; gene expression; gene frequency; gene identification; gene ontology; gene sequence; genetic association; genetic procedures; genetic variability; genome scan; geographic distribution; habitual adaptation; Mediterranean Sea; nonhuman; osmotic pressure; population genetic structure; protein expression; salinity; salt tolerance; sea surface waters; single nucleotide polymorphism; SOCS2 gene; striped red mullet; transcriptomics; whole genome sequencing; adaptation; animal; genetics; genome; genomics; population genetics; procedures; salinity; Smegmamorpha; statistical analysis; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Genetics, Population; Genome; Genomics; Salinity; Smegmamorpha",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Moreover, the power of traditional molecular studies is constrained by the number of markers being evaluated, which limits the potential to assess fine-scale population structure potentially common in urban areas.

Here, I provide a comprehensive review of previous urban ecological studies, with special focus on the molecular ecology and phenotypic adjustments documented in urban terrestrial and amphibious fauna. I subsequently pinpoint areas in the literature that could benefit from a genomic investigation and briefly discuss the suitability of specific techniques in addressing eco-evolutionary questions within urban ecology. Though many challenges exist with implementing genomics into urban ecology, such studies provide an exceptional opportunity to advance our understanding of eco-evolutionary processes in metropolitan areas. © The American Genetic Association 2018.

Despite the frequent use of OA and EAA approaches and their increasing attractiveness for detecting signatures of selection, their application to field-based empirical data have not been synthesized. Here, we review 66 empirical studies that use Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in OA and EAA. We report trends and biases across biological systems, sequencing methods, approaches, parameters, environmental variables and their influence on detecting signatures of selection. We found striking variability in both the use and reporting of environmental data and statistical parameters. For example, linkage disequilibrium among SNPs and numbers of unique SNP associations identified with EAA were rarely reported. The proportion of putatively adaptive SNPs detected varied widely among studies, and decreased with the number of SNPs analysed. We found that genomic sampling effort had a greater impact than biological sampling effort on the proportion of identified SNPs under selection. OA identified a higher proportion of outliers when more individuals were sampled, but this was not the case for EAA. To facilitate repeatability, interpretation and synthesis of studies detecting selection, we recommend that future studies consistently report geographical coordinates, environmental data, model parameters, linkage disequilibrium, and measures of genetic structure. Identifying standards for how OA and EAA studies are designed and reported will aid future transparency and comparability of SNP-based selection studies and help to progress landscape and evolutionary genomics. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adaptive genetic variation; environmental association analysis; FST outlier analysis; genotype by environment; landscape genomics; single nucleotide polymorphism","adaptation; evolution; gene linkage disequilibrium; genetic selection; genetic variation; genetics; genome; genomics; genotype; genotype environment interaction; population genetics; single nucleotide polymorphism; Adaptation, Physiological; Biological Evolution; Gene-Environment Interaction; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Genome; Genomics; Genotype; Linkage Disequilibrium; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Selection, Genetic",Review,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus

Therefore, studying partially isolated taxa has the potential to provide novel insight into the mechanisms of evolutionary divergence. Our study utilizes an adaptive colour polymorphism in the arc-eye hawkfish (Paracirrhites arcatus) to explore the evolution of reproductive barriers in the absence of geographic isolation. Dark and light morphs are ecologically partitioned into basaltic and coral microhabitats a few metres apart. To test whether ecological barriers have reduced gene flow among dark and light phenotypes, we evaluated genetic variation at 30 microsatellite loci and a nuclear exon (Mc1r) associated with melanistic coloration. We report low, but significant microsatellite differentiation among colour morphs and stronger divergence in the coding region of Mc1r indicating signatures of selection. Critically, we observed greater genetic divergence between colour morphs on the same reefs than that between the same morphs in different geographic locations. We hypothesize that adaptation to the contrasting microhabitats is overriding gene flow and is responsible for the partial reproductive isolation observed between sympatric colour morphs. Combined with complementary studies of hawkfish ecology and behaviour, these genetic results indicate an ecological barrier to gene flow initiated by habitat selection and enhanced by assortative mating. Hence, the arc-eye hawkfish fulfil theoretical expectations for the earliest phase of speciation with gene flow. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","colour polymorphism; coral reef fish; divergence with gene flow; incipient speciation; local adaptation; reproductive isolation","microsatellite DNA; animal; ecology; ecosystem; fish; gene flow; genetic polymorphism; genetic variation; genetics; pigmentation; population genetics; species difference; species differentiation; sympatry; Animals; Ecology; Ecosystem; Fishes; Gene Flow; Genetic Speciation; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Microsatellite Repeats; Pigmentation; Polymorphism, Genetic; Species Specificity; Sympatry",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

Separating signatures of clinal adaptation from signatures of other evolutionary forces, such as demographic processes, genetic drift and adaptation, to nonclinal conditions of the immediate local environment is a major challenge. Here, we examine climate adaptation in five natural populations of the harlequin fly Chironomus riparius sampled along a climatic gradient across Europe. Our study integrates experimental data, individual genome resequencing, Pool-Seq data and population genetic modelling. Common-garden experiments revealed significantly different population growth rates at test temperatures corresponding to the population origin along the climate gradient, suggesting thermal adaptation on the phenotypic level. Based on a population genomic analysis, we derived empirical estimates of historical demography and migration. We used an FST outlier approach to infer positive selection across the climate gradient, in combination with an environmental association analysis. In total, we identified 162 candidate genes as genomic basis of climate adaptation. Enriched functions among these candidate genes involved the apoptotic process and molecular response to heat, as well as functions identified in studies of climate adaptation in other insects. Our results show that local climate conditions impose strong selection pressures and lead to genomic adaptation despite strong gene flow. Moreover, these results imply that selection to different climatic conditions seems to converge on a functional level, at least between different insect species. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Diptera; Latent Factor Mixed Model; Multiple Sequential Markovian Coalescence; population divergence; temperature; thermal selection","acclimatization; adaptation; animal; Chironomidae; climate; climate change; ecosystem; Europe; genetic drift; genetic selection; genetics; genomics; growth, development and aging; population genetics; Acclimatization; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Chironomidae; Climate; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Europe; Genetic Drift; Genetics, Population; Genomics; Selection, Genetic",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

We used 7163 SNPs derived from restriction site-associated DNA sequencing genotyped in 245 individuals of the economically important sea scallop, Placopecten magellanicus, to evaluate the correlations between oceanographic variation and a previously identified latitudinal genomic cline. Sea scallops span a broad latitudinal area (&gt;10 degrees), and we hypothesized that climatic variation significantly drives clinal trends in allele frequency. Using a large environmental dataset, including temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a, and nutrient concentrations, we identified a suite of SNPs (285–621, depending on analysis and environmental dataset) potentially under selection through correlations with environmental variation. Principal components analysis of different outlier SNPs and environmental datasets revealed similar northern and southern clusters, with significant associations between the first axes of each (R2 adj =.66–.79). Multivariate redundancy analysis of outlier SNPs and the environmental principal components indicated that environmental factors explained more than 32% of the variance. Similarly, multiple linear regressions and random-forest analysis identified winter average and minimum ocean temperatures as significant parameters in the link between genetic and environmental variation. This work indicates that oceanographic variation is associated with the observed genomic cline in this species and that seasonal periods of extreme cold may restrict gene flow along a latitudinal gradient in this marine benthic bivalve.

Genotyping with mapped transcriptome-derived markers and advanced seascape statistical analyses are proven tools to uncover the genomic basis of biologically relevant traits under environmental selection. Using a panel of 426 gene-linked single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we scanned 17 samples (n = 539) of sole (Solea solea L.) from the Northeast Atlantic Ocean and applied a node-based seascape analysis. Neutral loci confirmed a clear distinction between the North Sea-Baltic Sea transition zone and the other Eastern Atlantic samples. At a more subtle level, the latter unit split in an English Channel and North Sea group, and a Bay of Biscay and Atlantic Iberian coast group. A fourth group, the Irish and Celtic Sea, was identified with 19 outlier loci. A pattern of isolation by distance (IBD) characterized the latitudinal distribution. Seascape analyses identified winter seawater temperature, food availability and coastal currents to explain a significant component of geographically distributed genetic variation, suggesting that these factors act as drivers of local adaptation. The evidence for local adaptation is in line with the current understanding on the impact of two key ecological factors, the life-history trait winter mortality and the behaviour of inshore/offshore spawning. We conclude that the subtle differentiation between two metapopulations (North Sea and Bay of Biscay) mirrors local adaptation. At least three genomic regions with strong population differentiation point to locally divergent selection. Further functional characterization of these genomic regions should help with formulating adaptive management policies. © International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2017.

Here, we examine the role of selection and drift in shaping genomic and phenotypic variation across recently separated populations of Berthelot's pipit (Anthus berthelotii), a passerine bird endemic to three archipelagos in the Atlantic. We first characterized genetic diversity and population structuring that supported previous inferences of a history of recent colonizations and bottlenecks. We then tested for regions of the genome associated with the ecologically important traits of bill length and malaria infection, both of which vary substantially across populations in this species. We identified a SNP associated with variation in bill length among individuals, islands, and archipelagos; patterns of variation at this SNP suggest that both phenotypic and genotypic variation in bill length is largely shaped by founder effects. Malaria was associated with SNPs near/within genes involved in the immune response, but this relationship was not consistent among archipelagos, supporting the view that disease resistance is complex and rapidly evolving. Although we found little evidence for divergent selection at candidate loci for bill length and malaria resistance, genome scan analyses pointed to several genes related to immunity and metabolism as having important roles in divergence and adaptation. Our findings highlight the utility and challenges involved with combining association mapping and population genetic analysis in nonequilibrium populations, to disentangle the effects of drift and selection on shaping genotypes and phenotypes. © 2018 The Author(s).

On the other hand, many physical barriers distribute along the continental marginal seas and may prevent dispersals and increase population divergence. These complexities along the continental margin generate serious challenges to population genetic studies of marine species. Chinese sea bass Lateolabrax maculatus distributes broad latitudinal gradient spanning from the tropical to the mid-temperate zones in the continental margin seas of the Northwest Pacific Ocean. Using the double digest restriction-site-associated DNA tag sequencing (ddRAD) approach, we genotyped 10,297 SNPs for 219 Chinese seabass individuals of 12 populations along the Chinese coast in the Northwest Pacific region. Genetic divergence among these populations was evaluated, and population structure was established. The results suggested that geographically distant populations in the Bohai Gulf and the Beibu Gulf retain significant genetic divergence, which are connected by a series of intermediate populations in between. The results also suggested that Leizhou Peninsula, Hainan Island, and Shandong Peninsula are major physical barriers and substantially block gene flow and genetic admixture of L. maculatus. We also investigated the potential genetic basis of local adaptation correlating with population differentiation of L. maculatus. The sea surface temperature is a significantly differentiated environmental factor for the distribution of L. maculatus. The correlation of water temperature and genetic variations in extensively distributed populations was investigated with Bayesian-based approaches. The candidate genes underlying the local selection in geographically divergent populations were identified and annotated, providing clues to understand the potential mechanisms of adaptive evolution.

Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, numerous forest species are subject to severe population decline. Investigating variation in genetic diversity, phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation should be a prerequisite for implementing conservation actions. This study aimed to explore these aspects in ten fragmented populations of Physospermum cornubiense in view of translocation measures across its Italian range. Methods. For each population we collected environmental data on landscape (habitat size, quality and fragmentation) and local conditions (slope, presence of alien species, incidence of the herbivorous insect Metcalfa pruinosa and soil parameters). We measured vegetative and reproductive traits in the field and analysed the genetic population structure using ISSR markers (STRUCTURE and AMOVA). We then estimated the neutral (FST) and quantitative (PST) genetic differentiation of populations. Results. The populations exhibited moderate phenotypic variation. Population size (range: 16-655 individuals), number of flowering adults (range: 3-420 individuals) and inflorescence size (range: 5.0-8.4 cm) were positively related to Mg soil content. Populations' gene diversity was moderate (Nei-H = 0.071-0.1316); STRUCTURE analysis identified five different clusters and three main geographic groups: upper, lower, and Apennine/Western Po plain. Fragmentation did not have an influence on the local adaptation of populations, which for all measured traits showed PST &lt; FST, indicating convergent selection. Discussion. The variation of phenotypic traits across sites was attributed to plastic response rather than local adaptation.

Studying the effects of selection and gene flow on the adaptation process can be achieved in systemsthat have recently colonized extremeenvironments. This study utilizes an endemic South American duck species, the speckled teal (Anas flavirostris),which has both high- and low-altitude populations. High-altitude speckled teal (A. f. oxyptera) are locally adapted to the Andean environment and mostly allopatric from low-altitude birds (A. f. flavirostris);however, there is occasional geneflowacross altitudinal gradients. In this study,we used next-generation sequencing to explore genetic patterns associated with high-altitude adaptation in speckled teal populations, as well as the extent to which the balance between selection and migration have affected genetic architecture. We identified a set of loci with allele frequencies strongly correlated with altitude, including those involved in the insulin-like signaling pathway, bone morphogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation, responders to hypoxia-induced DNAdamage, and feedback loops to the hypoxia-inducible factor pathway. These same outlier loci were found to have depressed gene flow estimates, as well as being highly concentrated on the Z-chromosome. Our results suggest a multifactorial response to life at high altitudes through an array of interconnected pathways that are likely under positive selection and whose genetic components seem to be providing an effective genomic barrier to interbreeding, potentially functioning as an avenue for population divergence and speciation. © The Author 2017.","Hypoxia; Local adaptation; Waterfowl","acclimatization; adaptation; altitude; animal; duck; gene flow; genetic drift; genetic selection; genetics; physiology; population migration; single nucleotide polymorphism; Acclimatization; Adaptation, Physiological; Altitude; Animal Migration; Animals; Ducks; Gene Flow; Genetic Drift; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Selection, Genetic",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

However, the contribution of the clinally varying trait to overall fitness is often unknown. To address this question, we examined survival, vegetative growth, and reproductive output in a central US common garden experiment using 161 genotypes of white clover (Trifolium repens L.) originating from 15 locations across North America. White clover is polymorphic for cyanogenesis (hydrogen cyanide release upon tissue damage), a chemical defense against generalist herbivores, and climate-associated cyanogenesis clines have repeatedly evolved across the species range. Over a 12-month experiment, we observed striking correlations between the population of origin and plant performance in the common garden, with climatic distance from the common garden site predicting fitness more accurately than geographic distance. Assessments of herbivore leaf damage over the 2015 growing season indicated marginally lower herbivory on cyanogenic plants; however, this effect did not result in increased fitness in the common garden location. Linear mixed modeling suggested that while cyanogenesis variation had little predictive value for vegetative growth, it is as important as climatic variation for predicting reproductive output in the central United States. Together, our findings suggest that knowledge of climate similarity, as well as knowledge of locally favored adaptive traits, will help to inform transplantation strategies for restoration ecology and other conservation efforts in the face of climate change. © The American Genetic Association 2017.

Considering that production of F1 hybrids rather than pure farmed offspring is the most likely outcome in the wild, pure farmed parr survival may have little bearing on the prediction of genetic risks of farmed-wild interactions.

Here, we utilized for the first time a combined reverse ecology and population transcriptomic approach to assess the contribution of thermal selection to population differentiation, thereby considering transcriptome-wide variation in both gene expression profiles and DNA sequences. We compared transcriptomes among four Daphnia galeata populations and identified transcripts potentially responding to local thermal selection based on an extensive literature search for candidate genes possibly under thermal selection in arthropods. Over-representation of temperature-relevant candidate genes among transcripts strongly contributing to sequence divergence among two populations indicates that local thermal selection acted on the coding sequence level. We identified a large number of transcripts, which may contribute to local thermal adaptation based on outlier tests and distinctive expression profiles. However, among these, temperature-relevant candidate genes were not over-represented compared to the global gene set, suggesting that thermal selection played a minor role in divergence among Daphnia populations. Interestingly, although the majority of genes contributing strongly to sequence divergence did not contribute strongly to divergence at the expression level and vice versa, the affected gene functions were largely consistent between the two data sets. This suggests that genetic and regulatory variation constitutes alternative routes for responses to natural selection.

A total of 141 individuals, collected from offshore sites and from a coastal site within Gilbert Bay, Labrador, were genotyped using an ~11k single nucleotide polymorphism array.

Allochronic differentiation refers to a particular situation where gene flow is primarily impeded by temporal isolation between early and late reproducers. This process has been suggested to occur in a large array of organisms, even though it is still overlooked in the literature. We here focused on a well-documented case of incipient allochronic speciation in the winter pine processionary moth Thaumetopoea pityocampa. This species typically reproduces in summer and larval development occurs throughout autumn and winter. A unique, phenologically shifted population (SP) was discovered in 1997 in Portugal. It was proved to be strongly differentiated from the sympatric “winter population” (WP), but its evolutionary history could only now be explored. We took advantage of the recent assembly of a draft genome and of the development of pan-genomic RAD-seq markers to decipher the demographic history of the differentiating populations and develop genome scans of adaptive differentiation. We showed that the SP diverged relatively recently, that is, few hundred years ago, and went through two successive bottlenecks followed by population size expansions, while the sympatric WP is currently experiencing a population decline. We identified outlier SNPs that were mapped onto the genome, but none were associated with the phenological shift or with subsequent adaptations. The strong genetic drift that occurred along the SP lineage certainly challenged our capacity to reveal functionally important loci. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","demographic inference; detection of selection; phenology; pine processionary moth; population genomics; RAD-sequencing","adaptation; animal; demography; gene flow; gene frequency; genetic variation; genetics; insect genome; moth; phylogeny; physiology; population genetics; principal component analysis; season; single nucleotide polymorphism; time factor; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Demography; Gene Flow; Gene Frequency; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Genome, Insect; Moths; Phylogeny; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Principal Component Analysis; Seasons; Time Factors",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

Studies show that the majority of coral populations will likely decline as temperatures continue to increase, although some previous species-distribution models predict that ubiquitous species, such as the primary reef-building coral species Porites lobata, will increase their distribution under projected climate change. These predictive models, however, assume that all individuals of a population are able to tolerate the entire range of environmental conditions within the species’ geographic range. The effects of genetic isolation and local adaptation are not considered in species-distribution models that assume genetically contiguous populations. We aim to determine the effects of genetic isolation and local adaptation in species-distribution modelling of the ubiquitous species P. lobata under three climate change scenarios by comparing contiguous and isolated subpopulations. Location: Indian and Pacific Oceans. Methods: We ran a novel species-distribution model for P. lobata, segregated as five geographically isolated regions across the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and examined the species response to three climate-change scenarios (i.e., A2, A1B and B1, most recently considered as Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5, 6.0, and 4.5 Wm−2) by the year 2100. Results: In contrast with previous homogeneous species-distribution models that predict a global expansion of P. lobata, (˜5 ± 1%), we predict major losses of suitable habitat for P. lobata in four of the five regions examined, particularly in the central Pacific Ocean (&gt;99% ± &lt;0.1% for all climate scenarios). Indeed, when geographic and genetic isolation were considered, our predictions suggested that P. lobata would lose between 50–52 ± 4% of its habitat, depending on the climate-change scenario, mainly in the Pacific Ocean. Main conclusions: Genetic isolation will likely play a major role in the persistence of coral species under climate change, and small isolated populations may be more vulnerable to climate change than populations in large, highly connected regions. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","climate; connectivity; corals; isolation; refuges; temperature","climate change; connectivity; coral; coral reef; ecological modeling; environmental conditions; genetic isolation; geographical distribution; habitat loss; home range; local adaptation; marine ecosystem; persistence; population decline; population distribution; range expansion; refuge; temperature anomaly; temperature effect; Indian Ocean; Pacific Ocean; Anthozoa; Porites lobata",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus

Here we investigate the population genetic structure of the orchard pest peach fruit moth (PFM) Carposina sasakii (Lepidoptera: Carposinidae) in China, which shows distinct biological differences when characterized from different host plants. Genetic diversity and genetic structure were assessed among populations from seven plant hosts and nine regions using 19 microsatellite loci and a mitochondrial sequence. Results: Strong genetic differentiation was found among geographical populations representing distinct geographical regions, but not in host-associated populations collected from the same area. Mantel tests based on microsatellite loci indicated an association between genetic differentiation and geographical distance, and to a lesser extent environmental differentiation. Approximate Bayesian Computation analyses supported the scenario that PFM likely originated from a southern area and dispersed northwards before the last glacial maximum during the Quaternary. Conclusions: Our analyses suggested a strong impact of geographical barriers and historical events rather than host plants on the genetic structure of the PFM; however, uncharacterized environmental factors and host plants may also play a role.

Here, we describe a stochastic, individual-based model that simulates evolutionary and demographic effects of migration and selection in interconnected sockeye salmon populations. Two populations were simulated based on parameters obtained empirically from wild populations in the Bristol Bay region of southwestern Alaska, representing beach- A nd stream-spawning ecotypes. Individuals underwent a full salmonid life cycle, experiencing sexual selection, size-selective harvest, and predation based on body size at maturity. Stabilizing natural selection on the three traits (body length, body depth, and age at maturity) tracked for all individuals favored different phenotypes in the two ecotype populations, and the three traits evolved in a genetically correlated manner. Simulation results showed that stabilizing selection on fish phenotypes was always critical for maintaining local adaptation, especially when dispersal rates were high, but loss of local adaptation did not result in substantial loss of productivity. Rather, productivity was more strongly influenced by the opposing effects of stabilizing and harvest selection; strong stabilizing selection caused the salmon to evolve larger body sizes that made them more likely to be caught in the fishery. The model results suggest that interactions between different selection pressures can have substantial demographic as well as evolutionary consequences in wild salmon populations, with key implications for sustainability of natural production in the face of selective harvest and systemic environmental change. © 2017 Lin et al.","Gene Flow; Human-Induced Evolution; Individual-Based Model; Local Adaptation; Natural Selection; Population Dynamics",,Article,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus

Convergent evolution at the level of a gene may arise via three distinct modes. The selected alleles can (1) have multiple independent mutational origins, (2) be shared due to shared ancestral standing variation, or (3) spread throughout subpopulations via gene flow. We present a model-based, statistical approach that utilizes genomic data to detect cases of convergent adaptation at the genetic level, identify the loci involved and distinguish among these modes. To understand the impact of convergent positive selection on neutral diversity at linked loci, we make use of the fact that hitchhiking can be modeled as an increase in the variance in neutral allele frequencies around a selected site within a population. We build on coalescent theory to show how shared hitchhiking events between subpopulations act to increase covariance in allele frequencies between subpopulations at loci near the selected site, and extend this theory under different models of migration and selection on the same standing variation. We incorporate this hitchhiking effect into a multivariate normal model of allele frequencies that also accounts for population structure. Based on this theory, we present a composite-likelihood-based approach that utilizes genomic data to identify loci involved in convergence, and distinguishes among alternate modes of convergent adaptation. We illustrate our method on genome-wide polymorphism data from two distinct cases of convergent adaptation. First, we investigate the adaptation for copper toxicity tolerance in two populations of the common yellow monkey flower, Mimulus guttatus. We show that selection has occurred on an allele that has been standing in these populations prior to the onset of copper mining in this region. Lastly, we apply our method to data from four populations of the killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus, that show very rapid convergent adaptation for tolerance to industrial pollutants. Here, we identify a single locus at which both independent mutation events and selection on an allele shared via gene flow, either slightly before or during selection, play a role in adaptation across the species’ range. © 2017 by the Genetics Society of America.","Coalescent theory; Composite likelihood; Convergent adaptation; Genetic hitchhiking; Positive selection","copper; adaptation; allele; Article; composite likelihood framework; conceptual framework; consanguinity; convergent evolution; Fundulus heteroclitus; gene frequency; gene locus; gene mutation; genetic distance; genetic drift; genetic model; genetic polymorphism; genetic selection; genetic variability; genomics; heavy metal poisoning; human; independent mutation model; maximum likelihood method; migration model; Mimulus; Mimulus guttatus; nonhuman; null hypothesis; null model; population genetics; population structure; priority journal; selective sweep; single nucleotide polymorphism; standing variant model; acclimatization; adaptation; animal; Fundulidae; gene flow; genetics; molecular evolution; mutation; plant genome; population genetics; Acclimatization; Adaptation, Physiological; Alleles; Animals; Evolution, Molecular; Fundulidae; Gene Flow; Genetics, Population; Genome, Plant; Mimulus; Mutation; Polymorphism, Genetic; Selection, Genetic",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

We used a comparative RNA-seq approach to assess expression variation within and among adaptively divergent populations of a threatened freshwater fish, Nannoperca australis, found across a steep hydroclimatic gradient in the Murray–Darling Basin, Australia. These populations evolved under contrasting selective environments (e.g., dry/hot lowland; wet/cold upland) and represent opposite ends of the species’ spectrum of genetic diversity and population size. We tested the hypothesis that environmental variation among isolated populations has driven the evolution of divergent expression at ecologically important genes using differential expression (DE) analysis and an anova-based comparative phylogenetic expression variance and evolution model framework based on 27,425 de novo assembled transcripts. Additionally, we tested whether gene expression variance within populations was correlated with levels of standing genetic diversity. We identified 290 DE candidate transcripts, 33 transcripts with evidence for high expression plasticity, and 50 candidates for divergent selection on gene expression after accounting for phylogenetic structure. Variance in gene expression appeared unrelated to levels of genetic diversity. Functional annotation of the candidate transcripts revealed that variation in water quality is an important factor influencing expression variation for N. australis. Our findings suggest that gene expression variation can contribute to the evolutionary potential of small populations. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Australia; climate change; comparative transcriptomics; conservation genomics; Nannoperca australis; RNA-seq","transcriptome; adaptation; animal; Australia; ecosystem; endangered species; fish; gene expression; genetic selection; genetic variation; genetics; molecular evolution; phylogeny; population density; sequence analysis; water quality; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Australia; Ecosystem; Endangered Species; Evolution, Molecular; Fishes; Gene Expression; Genetic Variation; Phylogeny; Population Density; Selection, Genetic; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Transcriptome; Water Quality",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus

India plays a vital role in the conservation of tigers since nearly 60% of all wild tigers are currently found here. However, as protected areas are small (&lt;300 km2 on average), with only a few individuals in each, many of them may not be independently viable. It is thus important to identify and conserve genetically connected populations, as well as to maintain connectivity within them. We collected samples from wild tigers (Panthera tigris tigris) across India and used genome-wide SNPs to infer genetic connectivity. We genotyped 10,184 SNPs from 38 individuals across 17 protected areas and identified three genetically distinct clusters (corresponding to northwest, southern and central India). The northwest cluster was isolated with low variation and high relatedness. The geographically large central cluster included tigers from central, northeastern and northern India, and had the highest variation. Most genetic diversity (62%) was shared among clusters, while unique variation was highest in the central cluster (8.5%) and lowest in the northwestern one (2%). We did not detect signatures of differential selection or local adaptation. We highlight that the northwest population requires conservation attention to ensure persistence of these tigers. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"attention; female; genetic variability; genome; human; India; local adaptation; major clinical study; male; nonhuman; tiger; animal; classification; endangered species; environmental protection; gene locus; genetic selection; genetic variation; genetics; genomics; geography; high throughput sequencing; phylogeny; population genetics; procedures; single nucleotide polymorphism; tiger; Animals; Conservation of Natural Resources; Endangered Species; Genetic Loci; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Genomics; Geography; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; India; Phylogeny; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Selection, Genetic; Tigers",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Despite advances in genomic technologies, detecting adaptive variation in natural populations remains challenging. Key challenges in gene–environment association studies involve distinguishing the effects of drift from those of selection and identifying subtle signatures of polygenic adaptation. We used paired-end restriction site-associated DNA sequencing data (6,605 biallelic single nucleotide polymorphisms; SNPs) to examine population structure and test for signatures of adaptation across the geographic range of an iconic Australian endemic freshwater fish species, the Murray cod Maccullochella peelii. Two univariate gene–association methods identified 61 genomic regions associated with climate variation. We also tested for subtle signatures of polygenic adaptation using a multivariate method (redundancy analysis; RDA). The RDA analysis suggested that climate (temperature- and precipitation-related variables) and geography had similar magnitudes of effect in shaping the distribution of SNP genotypes across the sampled range of Murray cod. Although there was poor agreement among the candidate SNPs identified by the univariate methods, the top 5% of SNPs contributing to significant RDA axes included 67% of the SNPs identified by univariate methods. We discuss the potential implications of our findings for the management of Murray cod and other species generally, particularly in relation to informing conservation actions such as translocations to improve evolutionary resilience of natural populations.

We used a landscape genomic approach to examine signatures of selection in urban populations of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) in New York City. We analysed 154,770 SNPs identified from transcriptome data from 48 P. leucopus individuals from three urban and three rural populations and used outlier tests to identify evidence of urban adaptation. We accounted for demography by simulating a neutral SNP data set under an inferred demographic history as a null model for outlier analysis.

In total, we detected 381 outlier loci and after stringent filtering, identified and annotated 19 candidate loci. Many of the candidate genes were involved in metabolic processes and have well-established roles in metabolizing lipids and carbohydrates. Our results indicate that white-footed mice in New York City are adapting at the biomolecular level to local selective pressures in urban habitats.

In this study, we investigated neutral, adaptive and deleterious genetic variation using 7,192 SNPs in 31 Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush) populations (n = 673) from Québec, Canada. Average genetic diversity was low, weakly shared among lakes, and positively correlated with lake size, indicating a major role for genetic drift subsequent to lake isolation. Putatively deleterious mutations were on average at lower frequencies than the other SNPs, and their abundance relative to the entire polymorphism in each population was positively correlated with inbreeding, suggesting that the effectiveness of purifying selection was negatively correlated with inbreeding, as predicted from theory. Despite evidence for pronounced genetic drift and inbreeding, several outlier loci were associated with temperature and found in or close to genes with biologically relevant functions notably related to heat stress and immune responses. Outcomes of gene–temperature associations were influenced by the inclusion of the most inbred populations, in which allele frequencies deviated the most from model predictions. This result illustrates challenge in identifying gene–environment associations in cases of high genetic drift and restricted gene flow and suggests limited adaptation in populations experiencing higher inbreeding.

Heterozygosity–fitness correlations (HFCs) have been widely used to study this link in wild populations, where key parameters that affect both variability and fitness, such as inbreeding, can be difficult to measure. We used estimates of parental heterozygosity and genetic similarity (‘relatedness’) derived from 32 microsatellite markers to explore the relationship between genetic variability and fitness in a population of the critically endangered hawksbill turtle, Eretmochelys imbricata. We found no effect of maternal MLH (multilocus heterozygosity) on clutch size or egg success rate, and no single-locus effects. However, we found effects of paternal MLH and parental relatedness on egg success rate that interacted in a way that may result in both positive and negative effects of genetic variability. Multicollinearity in these tests was within safe limits, and null simulations suggested that the effect was not an artefact of using paternal genotypes reconstructed from large samples of offspring. Our results could imply a tension between inbreeding and outbreeding depression in this system, which is biologically feasible in turtles: female-biased natal philopatry may elevate inbreeding risk and local adaptation, and both processes may be disrupted by male-biased dispersal. Although this conclusion should be treated with caution due to a lack of significant identity disequilibrium, our study shows the importance of considering both positive and negative effects when assessing how variation in genetic variability affects fitness in wild systems. © 2017 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

Determining the level of parallelism also at the genetic level is thus central to our understanding of how natural selection works. Many studies have looked for repeated genomic patterns in natural populations, but work on gene expression is less common. The studies that have examined gene expression have found some support for parallelism, but those studies almost always used samples collected from the wild that potentially confounds the effects of plasticity with heritable differences. Here we use two independent pairs of lake and stream threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) raised in common garden conditions to assess both parallel and antiparallel (that is, similar versus different directions of lake-stream expression divergence in the two watersheds) heritable gene expression differences as measured by total RNA sequencing. We find that more genes than expected by chance show either parallel (22 genes, 0.18% of expressed genes) or antiparallel (24 genes, 0.20% of expressed genes) lake-stream expression differences.

Landscape genomics is becoming an increasingly important and powerful tool for rapid assessments of climate adaptation, especially in long-lived species such as trees. We investigated climate adaptation in Eucalyptus microcarpa using the DArTseq genomic approach. A combination of FST outlier and environmental association analyses were performed using &gt;4200 genomewide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 26 populations spanning climate gradients in southeastern Australia. Eighty-one SNPs were identified as putatively adaptive, based on significance in FST outlier tests and significant associations with one or more climate variables related to temperature (70/81), aridity (37/81) or precipitation (35/81). Adaptive SNPs were located on all 11 chromosomes, with no particular region associated with individual climate variables. Climate adaptation appeared to be characterized by subtle shifts in allele frequencies, with no consistent fixed differences identified. Based on these associations, we predict adaptation under projected changes in climate will include a suite of shifts in allele frequencies. Whether this can occur sufficiently rapidly through natural selection within populations, or would benefit from assisted gene migration, requires further evaluation. In some populations, the absence or predicted increases to near fixation of particular adaptive alleles hint at potential limits to adaptive capacity.

Such patterns are especially interesting among populations distributed across habitat gradients, where genetic structure can be driven by isolation by distance (IBD) and/or isolation by environment (IBE). Here, we used variation in ~1,600 high-quality SNPs derived from paired-end sequencing of double-digest restriction site-associated DNA (ddRAD-Seq) to test hypotheses related to IBD and IBE in the Yucatan jay (Cyanocorax yucatanicus), a tropical bird endemic to the Yucatán Peninsula. This peninsula is characterized by a precipitation and vegetation gradient—from dry to evergreen tropical forests—that is associated with morphological variation in this species. We found a moderate level of nucleotide diversity (π =.008) and little evidence for genetic differentiation among vegetation types. Analyses of neutral and putatively adaptive SNPs (identified by complementary genome-scan approaches) indicate that IBD is the most reliable explanation to account for frequency distribution of the former, while IBE has to be invoked to explain those of the later. These results suggest that selective factors acting along a vegetation gradient can promote local adaptation in the presence of gene flow in a vagile, nonmigratory and geographically restricted species.

It is hypothesized that rapid evolution to anthropogenic changes may alter fundamental physiological processes (e.g., energy metabolism), compromising an organism's capacity to respond to additional stressors. The Elizabeth River (ER) Superfund site represents a ""natural-experiment"" to explore this hypothesis in several subpopulations of Atlantic killifish that have evolved a gradation of resistance to a ubiquitous pollutant - polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). We examined bioenergetic shifts and associated consequences in PAH-resistant killifish by integrating genomic, physiological, and modeling approaches. Population genomics data revealed that genomic regions encoding bioenergetic processes are under selection in PAH-adapted fish from the most contaminated ER site and ex vivo studies confirmed altered mitochondrial function in these fish. Further analyses extending to differentially PAH-resistant subpopulations showed organismal level bioenergetic shifts in ER fish that are associated with increased cost of living, decreased performance, and altered metabolic response to temperature stress - an indication of reduced thermal plasticity. A movement model predicted a higher energetic cost for PAH-resistant subpopulations when seeking an optimum habitat.

This knowledge gap persists despite a growing appreciation for the influence of evolution in human-altered environments. There, insights indicate that natural selection typically results in local adaptation. Thus, populations influenced by road-induced selection should evolve fitness advantages in their local environment. Contrary to this expectation, wood frog tadpoles from roadside populations show evidence of a fitness disadvantage, consistent with local maladaptation. Specifically, in reciprocal transplants, roadside populations survive at lower rates compared to populations away from roads. A key question remaining is whether roadside environmental conditions experienced by early stage embryos induce this outcome. This represents an important missing piece in evaluating the evolutionary nature of this maladaptation pattern. Here, I address this gap using a reciprocal transplant experiment designed to test the hypothesis that embryonic exposure to roadside pond water induces a survival disadvantage. Contrary to this hypothesis, my results show that reduced survival persists when embryonic exposure is controlled. This outcome indicates that the survival disadvantage is parentally mediated, either genetically and/or through inherited environmental effects. This result suggests that roadside populations are either truly maladapted or potentially locally adapted at later life stages. I discuss these interpretations, noting that regardless of mechanism, patterns consistent with maladaptation have important implications for conservation. In light of the pervasiveness of roads, further resolution explaining maladaptive responses remains a critical challenge in conservation. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Amphibians; Contemporary evolution; Inherited environmental effects; Local adaptation; Runoff","amphibian; embryonic development; environmental conditions; environmental effect; evolutionary biology; fitness; frog; local adaptation; natural selection; pond; population type; roadside environment; runoff; survival; Amphibia; Rana sylvatica; acclimatization; adaptation; animal; environmental exposure; genetic selection; larva; physiology; Ranidae; Acclimatization; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Environmental Exposure; Larva; Ranidae; Selection, Genetic",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

However, determining these boundaries can be difficult when population structure is subtle. Emperor penguins are highly reliant on sea ice, and some populations may be in jeopardy as climate change alters sea-ice extent and quality. An understanding of emperor penguin population structure is therefore urgently needed. Two previous studies have differed in their conclusions, particularly whether the Ross Sea, a major stronghold for the species, is isolated or not. We assessed emperor penguin population structure using 4,596 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), characterized in 110 individuals (10–16 per colony) from eight colonies around Antarctica. In contrast to a previous conclusion that emperor penguins are panmictic around the entire continent, we find that emperor penguins comprise at least four metapopulations, and that the Ross Sea is clearly a distinct metapopulation. Using larger sample sizes and a thorough assessment of the limitations of different analytical methods, we have shown that population structure within emperor penguins does exist and argue that its recognition is vital for the effective conservation of the species. We discuss the many difficulties that molecular ecologists and managers face in the detection and interpretation of subtle population structure using large SNP data sets, and argue that subtle structure should be taken into account when determining management strategies for threatened species, until accurate estimates of demographic connectivity among populations can be made. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Antarctica; dispersal; population genomics; RAD-seq; Ross Sea; Southern Ocean","animal; Antarctica; climate change; environmental protection; genetics; ice cover; penguin; population density; population genetics; single nucleotide polymorphism; Animals; Antarctic Regions; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Genetics, Population; Ice Cover; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Population Density; Spheniscidae",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus

Population genetic studies can provide insight on the degree to which populations are connected, and the development of restriction site-associated sequencing (RAD-Seq) methods has made such studies of nonmodel organisms more accessible. We applied double-digest RAD-Seq methods to test for population differentiation in the coral reef-dwelling cardinalfish, Siphamia tubifer, which based on behavioural studies, have the potential to use navigational cues to return to natal reefs. Analysis of 11,836 SNPs from fish collected at coral reefs in Okinawa, Japan, from eleven locations over 3 years reveals little genetic differentiation between groups of S. tubifer at spatial scales from 2 to 140 km and between years at one location: pairwise FST values were between 0.0116 and 0.0214. These results suggest that the Kuroshio Current largely influences larval dispersal in the region, and in contrast to expectations based on studies of other cardinalfishes, there is no evidence of population structure for S. tubifer at the spatial scales examined. However, analyses of outlier loci putatively under selection reveal patterns of temporal differentiation that indicate high population turnover and variable larval supply from divergent source populations between years.

The study of micro-evolutionary adaptation and its eco-evolutionary consequences is challenging for many reasons and the choice of a suitable model organism is particularly important. In this paper, we explain why monogonont rotifers, through their unique combination of traits, are ideal study organisms for this purpose. With a literature review, we demonstrate the capacity of monogonont populations to adapt to a variety of selection conditions (e.g., salinity, food shortage, elemental limitation, and disturbance regimes) within very short-time frames and highlight some potential eco-evolutionary implications. Although monogononts are increasingly used in eco-evolution-oriented studies, their potential is still underappreciated compared to other model organisms. No doubt the high prevalence of cryptic species complexes and the lack of genomic tools form important obstacles that may discourage researchers to work with this group.

In line with the results of Fst statistics, significant population structure was detected by applying PCoA and STRUCTURE analysis, which showed discrepant genetic patterns compared to previous studies using neutral markers. Selection tests showed that purifying selection was the predominant evolutionary force acting on the analyzed sequences. Valine substitution by Alanine in a single codon 372 in CYTB gene was detected predominantly (93%) in FA population and temperature was a potentially relevant environmental feature.

Such clines are thought to result from selection favouring local adaptation; however, empirical tests are scarce. The seaweed fly Coelopa frigida has an α/β inversion polymorphism, and previous work demonstrated that the α inversion frequency declines from the North Sea to the Baltic Sea and is correlated with changes in tidal range, salinity, algal composition and wrackbed stability. Here, we explicitly test the hypothesis that populations of C. frigida along this cline are locally adapted by conducting a reciprocal transplant experiment of four populations along this cline to quantify survival. We found that survival varied significantly across treatments and detected a significant Location x Substrate interaction, indicating local adaptation. Survival models showed that flies from locations at both extremes had highest survival on their native substrates, demonstrating that local adaptation is present at the extremes of the cline. Survival at the two intermediate locations was, however, not elevated at the native substrates, suggesting that gene flow in intermediate habitats may override selection.

Individuals that avoid fishing mortality by spending most of the time inside the reserve limits (i.e. with smaller home ranges) will experience a fitness advantage, whereas individuals that move beyond boundaries (i.e. with larger home ranges) will increase their risk of being harvested by spillover fisheries. We use empirical data on Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) home ranges within and around a coastal marine reserve in south Norway as a case to illustrate our idea.

The critical swimming speeds (Ucrit) of the different crosses were measured in both fresh (FW) and salt water (SW) and the variations in several physiological traits (osmotic, energetic and metabolic capacities) that are predicted to influence swimming performance were documented. Anadromous and resident fish reached the same Ucrit in both FW and SW, with Ucrit being 14% lower in SW compared with FW. The strains, however, seemed to use different underlying strategies: the anadromous strain relied on its streamlined body shape and higher osmoregulatory capacity, while the resident strain had greater citrate synthase (FW) and lactate dehydrogenase (FW, SW) capacity and either greater initial stores or more efficient use of liver (FW, SW) and muscle (FW) glycogen during exercise. Compared with R♀L♂ hybrids, L♀R♂ hybrids had a 20% lower swimming speed, which was associated with a 24% smaller cardio-somatic index and higher physiological costs.

Species distribution models (SDMs) use the current relationship between environmental variation and species’ abundances to predict the effect of future environmental change on their distributions. However, two common assumptions of SDMs are likely to be violated in many cases: (i) that the relationship of environment with abundance or fitness is constant throughout a species’ range and will remain so in future and (ii) that abiotic factors (e.g. temperature, humidity) determine species’ distributions. We test these assumptions by relating field abundance of the rainforest fruit fly Drosophila birchii to ecological change across gradients that include its low and high altitudinal limits. We then test how such ecological variation affects the fitness of 35 D. birchii families transplanted in 591 cages to sites along two altitudinal gradients, to determine whether genetic variation in fitness responses could facilitate future adaptation to environmental change. Overall, field abundance was highest at cooler, high-altitude sites, and declined towards warmer, low-altitude sites. By contrast, cage fitness (productivity) increased towards warmer, lower-altitude sites, suggesting that biotic interactions (absent from cages) drive ecological limits at warmer margins. In addition, the relationship between environmental variation and abundance varied significantly among gradients, indicating divergence in ecological niche across the species’ range. However, there was no evidence for local adaptation within gradients, despite greater productivity of high-altitude than low-altitude populations when families were reared under laboratory conditions. Families also responded similarly to transplantation along gradients, providing no evidence for fitness trade-offs that would favour local adaptation. These findings highlight the importance of (i) measuring genetic variation in key traits under ecologically relevant conditions, and (ii) considering the effect of biotic interactions when predicting species’ responses to environmental change. © 2017 The Authors.

Our approach involves a double-digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD-seq) technique, applied to adult females, nonpregnant males, pregnant males, and their offspring. An FST comparison of allele frequencies among these groups reveals 47 genomic regions putatively experiencing sexual selection, as well as 468 regions showing a signature of differential viability selection between males and females. A complementary likelihood ratio test identifies similar patterns in the data as the FST analysis. Sexual selection and viability selection both tend to favor the rare alleles in the population.

This genetic variation occurs both spatially and temporally through decades of heavy fishing, and is concentrated in three linkage disequilibrium blocks, previously defined by pedigreed linkage mapping analysis. Variation within these genomic regions is correlated with both seawater temperature and behavioral ecotype. The full extent and nature of these linkage groups is important information for interpreting cod genetic structure as a tool for future fisheries management. Results: We conducted whole genome sequencing for 31 individual cod from three sub-populations in the Gulf of Maine. Across the genome, we found 3,390,654 intermediate to high frequency Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). We show that pairwise linkage analysis among these SNPs is a powerful tool to detect linkage disequilibrium clusters by recovering the three previously detected linkage groups and identifying the 1031 genes contained therein. Across these genes, we found significant population differentiation among spawning groups in the Gulf of Maine and between Georges Bank and Gulf of Maine. Coordinated divergence among these genes and their differentiation at both short and long spatial scales suggests that they are acting as linked supergenes in local adaptation of cod populations. Conclusions: Differentiation between SNPs in linkage disequilibrium blocks is the major signal of genetic differentiation between all groups tested within the Gulf of Maine. Our data provide a map of genes contained in these blocks, allowing an enhanced search for neutral genetic structure for demographic inference and fisheries modeling. Patterns of selection and the history of populations may be possible to identify in cod using this description of linkage disequilibrium blocks and future data sets to robustly separate neutral and selected genetic markers. © 2017 The Author(s).","Atlantic cod; Gadus morhua; Genomic divergence; Gulf of Maine; Linkage disequilibrium; Linkage map; Supergene","Atlantic cod; fishery management; gene frequency; gene linkage disequilibrium; gene mutation; gene structure; genetic marker; genetic variability; linkage analysis; local adaptation; Maine; nonhuman; population differentiation; population model; single nucleotide polymorphism; spawning; whole genome sequencing; animal; Atlantic cod; chromosomal mapping; gene linkage disequilibrium; genetic linkage; genetic variation; genetics; genome; genomics; geography; Maine; population genetics; genetic marker; Animals; Chromosome Mapping; Gadus morhua; Genetic Linkage; Genetic Markers; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Genome; Genomics; Geography; Linkage Disequilibrium; Maine; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

This species is sessile as an adult, has a short-lived larval stage, and may also be dispersed by artificial transport as biofouling. We found that the main signal in neutral loci was a highly divergent lineage present at 39°S, and a subjacent signal that indicated a separation at 30°S (north/south), widely reported in the area.

An understanding of the ecological, life-history and geographic variables that predict this intra- and interspecific variation can guide our projections of how populations and species are likely to respond to future climate change. Here, we conduct phylogenetic meta-analyses addressing slope estimates of the timing of avian spring migration regressed on (i) year and (ii) temperature, representing a total of 413 species across five continents. We take into account slope estimation error and examine phylogenetic, ecological and geographic predictors of intra- and interspecific variation. We confirm earlier findings that on average birds have significantly advanced their spring migration time by 2·1 days per decade and 1·2 days °C−1. We find that over time and in response to warmer spring conditions, short-distance migrants have advanced spring migratory phenology by more than long-distance migrants. We also find that larger bodied species show greater advance over time compared to smaller bodied species. Our results did not reveal any evidence that interspecific variation in migration response is predictable on the basis of species' habitat or diet. We detected a substantial phylogenetic signal in migration time in response to both year and temperature, suggesting that some of the shifts in migratory phenological response to climate are predictable on the basis of phylogeny. However, we estimate high levels of species and spatial variance relative to phylogenetic variance, which is consistent with plasticity in response to climate evolving fairly rapidly and being more influenced by adaptation to current local climate than by common descent. On average, avian spring migration times have advanced over time and as spring has become warmer. While we are able to identify predictors that explain some of the true among-species variation in response, substantial intra- and interspecific variation in migratory response remains to be explained. © 2016 The Authors.

To address this limitation, spatial-temporal genetic structure using 8 microsatellite loci was assessed across the majority of the species' NE Atlantic distribution. Neutral genetic structuring revealed a background of high gene flow throughout the region, with a superimposed pattern of chaotic genetic patchiness (CGP) linked to stochastic recruitment variability. The CGP was geographically patterned, being prevalent among English Channel samples but absent among North Sea samples, suggesting specific biological (e.g. reproductive ecology) and environmental (seascape) drivers. Such recruitment variability may compromise stock resilience and must be considered within spatial management strategies. Another prominent feature was pronounced differentiation at a single locus for males sampled within a single fjord (Gulmarsfjord) from all other samples, exhibiting the effects of divergent selection. Gulmarsfjord females were genetically similar to all other 'non-fjord' samples, and exhibited a comparative level of differentiation at the outlier locus from the Gulmarsfjord males. Due to known dispersal differences between the sexes, the pattern within Gulmarsfjord can be explained by the intermingling of allochthonous females with resident, locally adapted males and demonstrates the occurrence of fine-scale local adaptation in this species. Collectively, the study highlights how considerable intraspecific eco-evolutionary diversification can occur despite high levels of dispersal/gene flow. © Inter-Research 2017.","Adaptation; Conservation; Dispersal; Gene flow; Sustainability; Sweepstakes recruitment","connectivity; conservation; crab; dispersal; fjord; gene flow; genetic marker; life history; local adaptation; patchiness; population structure; recruitment (population dynamics); Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean; English Channel; North Sea; Cancer pagurus; Decapoda (Crustacea)",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

In particular, both local adaptation to pathogens and gene flow are thought to explain a large part of the intraspecific variation observed in MHC allelic diversity. To date, however, evidence that adaptation to locally prevalent pathogens maintains MHC variation is limited to species with limited dispersal and, hence, reduced gene flow. On the one hand high gene flow can disrupt local adaptation in species with high dispersal rates, on the other hand such species are much more likely to experience spatial variation in pathogen pressure, suggesting that there may be intense pathogen mediated selection pressure operating across breeding sites in panmictic species. Such pathogen mediated selection pressure operating across breeding sites should therefore be sufficient to maintain high MHC diversity in high dispersing species in the absence of local adaptation mechanisms. We used the Greater Flamingo, Phoenicopterus roseus, a long-lived colonial bird showing a homogeneous genetic structure of neutral markers at the scale of the Mediterranean region, to test the prediction that higher MHC allelic diversity with no population structure should occur in large panmictic populations of long-distance dispersing birds than in other resident species. Results: We assessed the level of allelic diversity at the MHC Class IIB exon 2 from 116 individuals born in four different breeding colonies of Greater Flamingo in the Mediterranean region. We found one of the highest allelic diversity (109 alleles, 2 loci) of any non-passerine avian species investigated so far relative to the number of individuals and loci genotyped. There was no evidence of population structure between the four major Mediterranean breeding colonies. Conclusion: Our results suggest that local adaptation at MHC Class IIB in Greater Flamingos is constrained by high gene flow and high MHC diversity appears to be maintained by population wide pathogen-mediated selection rather than local pathogen-mediated selection. Further understanding of how pathogens vary across space and time will be crucial to further elucidate the mechanisms maintaining MHC diversity in species with large panmictic populations and high dispersal rates. © 2017 The Author(s).","Allelic diversity; Greater flamingos; Local adaptation; MHC genes; Pathogen-mediated balancing selection","allele; breeding population; dispersal; gene flow; genetic analysis; genetic differentiation; genetic structure; local adaptation; major histocompatibility complex; Mediterranean environment; natural selection; pathogenicity; spatial variation; wader; Aves; Passeriformes; Phoenicopterus; Vertebrata; HLA antigen class 2; allele; animal; bird; exon; gene; gene flow; genetic selection; genetic variation; genetics; genotype; Alleles; Animals; Birds; Exons; Gene Flow; Genes, MHC Class II; Genetic Variation; Genotype; Histocompatibility Antigens Class II; Selection, Genetic",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

In such systems, local competition for access to females is intense and typically only a few males obtain matings, leading to strong sexual selection. Sampling multiple breeding areas could then provide a mechanism for males to increase their chances to reproduce. However, little is known about such sampling behaviour and about the spatial scale at which males compete. Here we show that most males of a migratory, polygynous shorebird, the pectoral sandpiper (Calidris melanotos), that arrived at a known breeding location in northern Alaska subsequently moved through a considerable part of the entire species' breeding range (up to 13,045 km in a four-week period), sampling as many as 23 additional potential breeding sites. Our data suggest that males do not have a final breeding destination after migration from their wintering quarters, but make nomadic movements that are probably not a consequence of breeding failure. Tenure, the duration of stay at a site, correlated strongly with the number of breeding females at the site, suggesting that decisions to leave are dependent on local mating opportunities. Nomadic movements may allow males to display and sire offspring at multiple sites within a single breeding season. Sexual selection may then favour high-performance males that are able to reduce sleep to compete locally and to fly long distances between breeding sites, leading to a population with unrestricted interbreeding and without local adaptation and speciation. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.",,"arctic environment; breeding season; breeding site; decision analysis; dominance; individual variation; local adaptation; male; movement; polygyny; population migration; sampling; sexual selection; wader; Alaska; Arctic; Article; breeding; local adaptation; male; mating; migrant bird; migration; nonhuman; polygyny; priority journal; progeny; reproductive success; sexual selection; shorebird; species differentiation; spring; animal; Canada; Charadriiformes; competitive behavior; female; genetics; mate choice; pair bonding; physiology; population migration; reproduction; Russian Federation; season; sexual behavior; sleep; Alaska; United States; Calidris melanotos; Alaska; Animal Migration; Animals; Arctic Regions; Canada; Charadriiformes; Competitive Behavior; Female; Genetic Speciation; Male; Mating Preference, Animal; Pair Bond; Reproduction; Russia; Seasons; Sexual Behavior, Animal; Siberia; Sleep",Article,"",Scopus

In this framework, it is important to focus research on the photosynthetic response of habitat-forming species which have an important structural and functional role in coastal ecosystems. Most of the studies on the impacts of OA involve short-term laboratory or micro/mesocosm experiments. It is more challenging to assess the adaptive responses of macroalgal community to decreasing ocean pH over long-term periods, as they represent the basis of trophic dynamics in marine environments. This work aims to study the physiological traits of a population of Sargassum vulgare that lives naturally in the high pCO2 vents system in Ischia (Italy), in order to predict the species behaviour in a possible OA future scenario. With this purpose, the photosynthetic performance of S. vulgare was studied in a wild, natural population living at low pH (6.7) as well as in a population transplanted from native (6.7) to ambient pH (8.1) for three weeks. The main results show that the photochemical activity and Rubisco expression decreased by 30% after transplanting, whereas the non-photochemical dissipation mechanisms and the photosynthetic pigment content increased by 50% and 40% respectively, in order to compensate for the decrease in photochemical efficiency at low pH. Our data indicated a stress condition for the S. vulgare population induced by pH variation, and therefore a reduced acclimation capability at different pH conditions. The decline of the PSII maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm) and the increase of PARP enzyme activity in transplanted thalli further supported this hypothesis. The absence of the species at ambient pH conditions close to the vent system, as well as the differences in physiological traits, suggest a local adaptation of S. vulgare at pH 6.7, through optimization of photosynthetic performance. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptive response; Brown algae; Ecophysiology; Ocean acidification; Poly(ADP-ribosylation); Stress response","Acidification; Algae; Ecosystems; Enzyme activity; pH; Physiology; Population statistics; Adaptive response; ADP-ribosylation; Brown algae; Ecophysiology; Ocean acidifications; Stress response; Physiological models; carbon dioxide; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase; pigment; ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase; carbon dioxide; sea water; acidification; adaptation; brown alga; ecophysiology; environmental stress; pH; photosynthesis; physiological response; population dynamics; acidification; Article; carbon fixation; controlled study; enzyme activity; fresh weight; Italy; local adaptation; nonhuman; ocean acidification; pH; photochemistry; plasticity; priority journal; protein function; quantum yield; Sargassum; Sargassum vulgare; species distribution; stress; stress management; chemistry; pH; physiology; Sargassum; Campania [Italy]; Ischia; Italy; Napoli [Campania]; Phaeophyceae; Sargassum vulgare; Carbon Dioxide; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Italy; Sargassum; Seawater",Article,"",Scopus

Under the Core-Periphery Hypothesis (CPH), genetic diversity is expected to be highest at the centre of a species' distribution, progressively decreasing with increased differentiation towards outer range limits, as populations become increasingly isolated, fragmented and locally adapted. The unique life history characteristics of many marine invertebrates such as high dispersal rates, stochastic survival and variable recruitment are also likely to influence how populations are organised. To examine the microevolutionary forces influencing population structure, connectivity and adaptive variation in a highly-dispersive bivalve, populations of the black-lip pearl oyster Pinctada margaritifera were examined across its ~18,000 km Indo-Pacific distribution. Results: Analyses utilising 9,624 genome-wide SNPs and 580 oysters, discovered differing patterns of significant and substantial broad-scale genetic structure between the Indian and Pacific Ocean basins.

Partitioning of genetic diversity (hierarchical AMOVA) attributed 18.1% of variance between ocean basins, whereas greater proportions were resolved within samples and populations (45.8% and 35.7% respectively). Visualisation of population structure at selectively neutral loci resolved three and five discrete genetic clusters for the Indian and Pacific Oceans respectively. Evaluation of genetic structure at adaptive loci for Pacific populations (89 SNPs under directional selection; F st = 0.1012-0.4371, FDR = 0.05), revealed five clusters identical to those detected at neutral SNPs, suggesting environmental heterogeneity within the Pacific. Patterns of structure and connectivity were supported by Mantel tests of isolation by distance (IBD) and independent hydrodynamic particle dispersal simulations. Conclusions: It is evident that genetic structure and connectivity across the natural range of P. margaritifera is highly complex, and produced by the interaction of ocean currents, IBD and seascape features at a broad scale, together with habitat geomorphology and local adaptation at regional levels. Overall population organisation is far more elaborate than generalised CPH predictions, however valuable insights for regional fishery management, and a greater understanding of range-wide genetic structure in a highly-dispersive marine invertebrate have been gained. © 2017 The Author(s).","Aquaculture; Core-periphery hypothesis; Hydrodynamic dispersal; Population genomics; SNP; Species distribution","aquaculture; directional selection; fishery management; gene flow; gene structure; genetic isolation by distance; genetic variability; genome; genomics; geomorphology; habitat; hydrodynamics; Indian Ocean; local adaptation; nonhuman; ocean current; Pacific Ocean; Pinctada; population model; population structure; prediction; species distribution; adaptation; animal; animal dispersal; genetic variation; genetics; physiology; Pinctada; population migration; single nucleotide polymorphism; Adaptation, Physiological; Animal Distribution; Animal Migration; Animals; Genetic Variation; Indian Ocean; Pacific Ocean; Pinctada; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Unlike morphological traits in plants, photosythesis has been shown to exhibit phenotypic plasticity, responding rapidly to environmental conditions. Meanwhile, local adaptation at small scales is considered to be rare. Thus, detecting the small-scale adaptive divergence of photosynthetic pigments presents a challenge. Leaf concentrations of photosynthetic pigments under stressful conditions may be reduced or maintained. Concentrations of some pigments and/or ratio of Chlorophyll a (Chla) to Chlorophyll b (Chlb) do not change markedly in some species, such as the common reed, Phragmites australis, a cosmopolitan grass and common invader. Little is known about photosynthetic responses of this plant to varying levels of alkali salt. Few studies have attempted to account for the relationship between pigment accumulation and leaf position in wild plant populations in grasslands. In this study, photosynthetic pigment concentrations and the total Chl(a+b)/Car ratio decreased as the growing season progressed and were shown to be significantly lower in the habitat with a higher soil pH value and less moisture when compared between habitats. The Chla/Chlb ratio did not differ significantly between habitats, although it increased significantly over time. Leaves in the middle position may be functionally important in the response to soil conditions because only pigment concentrations and the Chl(a+b)/Car ratio of those leaves varied between habitats significantly. The outlier loci, used to evaluate molecular signatures of selection, were detected by Arlequin, Bayescan, and Bayenv analyses. In the simulated habitats of common garden, the local genotypes had higher values of Chla, Chlb, Chl(a+b), Car in their home habitat than did genotypes originating from the other habitat. QST-FST comparisons provided evidence of divergent selection. It appears likely that soil moisture, pH and electric conductivity drove local adaptation. Combined approaches that utilize information on phenotypes from field and common garden experiments, genome-wide markers, and environmental data will be the most informative for understanding the adaptive nature of the intraspecific divergence. © 2017 Qiu, Jiang, Li and Yang.","Alkali salt; Leaf position; Local adaptation; Outlier loci; Photosynthetic pigment; Population genomics; Reed; Selection",,Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

To ask whether rapid adaptation in reef-building corals can keep pace with future ocean warming, we measured genetic variation at predicted warm-adapted loci and simulated future evolution and persistence in a high-latitude population of corals from Rarotonga, Cook Islands. Alleles associated with thermal tolerance were present but at low frequencies in this cooler, southerly locality. Simulations based on predicted ocean warming in Rarotonga showed rapid evolution of heat tolerance resulting in population persistence under mild warming scenarios consistent with low CO2 emission plans, RCP2.6 and RCP4.5. Under more severe scenarios, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5, adaptation was not rapid enough to prevent extinction. Population adaptation was faster for models based on smaller numbers of additive loci that determine thermal tolerance and for higher population growth rates. Finally, accelerated migration via transplantation of thermally tolerant individuals (1 to 5%/year) sped adaptation. These results show that cool-water corals can adapt to warmer oceans but only under mild scenarios resulting from international emissions controls. Incorporation of genomic data into models of species response to climate change offers a promising method for estimating future adaptive processes.

Performance traits and environmental tolerance limits are predicted to be related to the typical abiotic and biotic conditions encountered by each population. Endurance swim performance at three different temperatures (8, 12, 22 °C) was compared across nine populations of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka (Walbaum, 1792)) parr from British Columbia, Canada, reared in a common laboratory environment. In addition, relative ventricular mass (RVM) was compared between good and poor performers from each population. Populations significantly differed in endurance swim performance and these differences were related to the natal lake environment. Specifically, parr populations that reside in warm, shallow lakes (Okanagan, Scotch, and Stellako) had superior swim performance at 12 °C compared with 8 °C. All other populations from deeper, cooler lakes had equivalent swim performance at 8 and 12 °C. Individual variability in swim performance within a population was not due to differences in cardiac size. Similarly, RVM did not vary across parr populations, suggesting that population differences in swim performance were not associated with cardiac size. This study provides further support that sockeye salmon parr are locally adapted to their environmental conditions. © 2017, Published by NRC Research Press.","Aerobic swim performance; Cardiac; Endurance; Heart; Local adaptation; Oncorhynchus nerka; Population; Sockeye salmon; Temperature","body size; cardiovascular system; environmental conditions; intraspecific variation; local adaptation; oxic conditions; performance assessment; population size; salmonid; swimming behavior; temperature; testing method; Oncorhynchus; Oncorhynchus nerka",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

Species distributed across such biogeographic discontinuities are thus more prone to develop genetic clines and adaptations to environmental variation. The northwest coast of France encompasses a biogeographic boundary between cold- and warmerate marine ecosystems. Distinct hydrographic features characterize northern and southern shores, promoting physical oceanographic breaks that can affect dispersal and connectivity between populations. Furthermore, mosaics of contrasting conditions may affect local patterns of species assemblages and potential adaptive pressures. Along this stretch of coast, the intertidal habitat is largely dominated by brown algae of the genus Fucus, key structuring species common along North Atlantic shorelines. Fucus spiralis, F. guiryi and F. vesiculosus are sister species with different mating systems. They have extensive sympatric geographical distributions and distinct but overlapping vertical distributions in the intertidal zone. We examined genetic structure and diversity across this major environmental transition zone using neutral microsatellite markers to investigate patterns of differentiation between populations of each species inhabiting the two different biogeographic regions. We found contrasting results between the dioecious species (F. vesiculosus) and the two selfing hermaphroditic lineages (F. spiralis and F. guiryi). Genetic differentiation of northern and southern populations of F. vesiculosus followed the expectation from a hypothetical oceanographic discontinuity across this biogeographical transition zone, but this was not the case for the two hermaphroditic species. The former had higher genetic diversity and structure along the distribution range investigated whereas selfing hermaphrodites had less variability and were not geographically structured. Our results suggest that genetic patterns are correlated with this biogeographical transition zone but this effect is dependent on mating system, a determining factor affecting population structure. Additionally, other factors such as intertidal elevation may also play a role in observed difference in genetic structuring. © EDP Sciences 2017.","Biogeographic transition zones; Fucus; Genetic diversity; Mating system; Microsatellites","biogeography; brown alga; genetic analysis; genetic differentiation; genetic marker; genetic variation; geographical distribution; hermaphrodite; intertidal environment; local adaptation; marine ecosystem; population genetics; population structure; reproductive strategy; transition zone; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); France; Fucus; Fucus spiralis; Fucus vesiculosus; Phaeophyceae",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus

One emerging tool for this goal is high-throughput sequencing technology, which can now be used to scan the genome for signs of environmental selection in any species and any system. This explosion of data provides a powerful new window into the molecular mechanisms of adaptation, and although there has been some success in using genomic data to predict responses to selection in fields such as agriculture, thus far genomic data are rarely integrated into predictive frameworks of future adaptation in natural populations. Here, we review both theoretical and empirical studies of adaptation to rapid environmental change, focusing on areas where genomic data are poised to contribute to our ability to estimate species and population persistence and adaptation. We advocate for the need to study and model evolutionary response architectures, which integrate spatial information, fitness estimates, and plasticity with genetic architecture.

However, once established, invaders might also be controlled by taking advantage of adaptations of threatened species to local conditions. This strategy was explored in dwarf galaxias (Galaxiella pusilla) a freshwater-dependent species of national conservation significance in Australia, threatened by invasive eastern gambusia (Gambusia holbrooki). Most habitats occupied by G. pusilla experience a seasonally variable and unpredictable hydrologic regime, where water levels substantially contract during dry periods and expand during wet periods. It was hypothesised that they are likely to have developed adaptations to surviving in these habitats by persisting without surface water. In contrast to G. holbrooki, we found that G. pusilla could withstand longer periods without surface water, including air breathing and higher respiration rates in air, than could G. holbrooki. We showed, within a single G. pusilla population, large inter-annual variability in fish densities linked to natural wetting and drying regimes. These findings indicate that periodic drying provides a way of protecting G. pusilla in water bodies where G. holbrooki has invaded, representing a strategy that takes advantage of local adaptation and metapopulation structure of G. pusilla. © CSIRO 2017.","air breathing; behavioural adaptation; Gambusia holbrooki; invasive; metapopulation; physiological adaptation.","annual variation; behavioral response; biological invasion; conservation management; endangered species; hydrological regime; invasive species; local adaptation; metapopulation; physiological response; population density; population structure; respiration; species conservation; survival; teleost; Australia; Galaxias divergens; Galaxiella pusilla; Galaxiidae; Gambusia; Gambusia holbrooki; Teleostei",Article,"",Scopus

For marine ectotherms such as fish, temperature is a key abiotic factor, influencing metabolic processes. Species distribution and abundance are driven by reproduction and growth, which depend on available energy exceeding baseline maintenance costs. These routine metabolic costs make up a large part of the energy expenditure. Thermal stress can increase routine metabolism, affecting an organism’s fitness. Data of routine metabolic rates of Antarctic fish are scarce, and comparability of existing data sets is often problematic due to ecological differences between species and in experimental protocols. Our objective was to compare routine metabolism and thermal sensitivity of species with similar ecotypes but different thermal environments to assess possible ecological implications of warming waters on energy expenditure in Antarctic fish, a fauna characterised by geographic isolation, endemism and putative thermal adaptation. We measured routine metabolic rates of three benthic Antarctic fish species from low- and high-Antarctic regions at habitat temperature and during acute temperature increase. Our analysis revealed differences in metabolic rates at the same temperature suggesting local adaptation to habitat temperature. Acute thermal stress induced a comparable response of metabolic rates to increasing temperature. We conclude that higher metabolic rates and thus higher energetic costs could be associated with narrower thermal windows, a potential disadvantage to the endemic high-Antarctic fish fauna facing the challenge of climate change. © 2016, The Author(s).","Metabolic cold adaptation; Notothenioids; Polar fish; Respiration; Routine metabolic rate","abiotic factor; abundance; behavioral response; climate change; ecotype; ectothermy; fitness; local adaptation; metabolism; perciform; polar region; population distribution; reproduction; respiration; temperature effect; temperature tolerance; Antarctica",Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus

To date, these marine studies have predominantly focused on rudimentary metrics describing the spatial and environmental context of their study region (e.g., geographical distance, average sea surface temperature, average salinity). We contend that a more nuanced and considered approach to quantifying seascape dynamics and patterns can strengthen population genomic investigations and help identify spatial, temporal, and environmental factors associated with differing selective regimes or demographic histories. Nevertheless, approaches for quantifying marine landscapes are complicated. Characteristic features of the marine environment, including pelagic living in flowing water (experienced by most marine taxa at some point in their life cycle), require a well-designed spatial-temporal sampling strategy and analysis. Many genetic summary statistics used to describe populations may be inappropriate for marine species with large population sizes, large species ranges, stochastic recruitment, and asymmetrical gene flow. Finally, statistical approaches for testing associations between seascapes and population genomic patterns are still maturing with no single approach able to capture all relevant considerations. None of these issues are completely unique to marine systems and therefore similar issues and solutions will be shared for many organisms regardless of habitat. Here, we outline goals and spatial approaches for landscape genomics with an emphasis onmarine systems and review the growing empirical literature on seascape genomics. We review established tools and approaches and highlight promising new strategies to overcome select issues including a strategy to spatially optimize sampling. Despite the many challenges, we argue that marine systems may be especially well suited for identifying candidate genomic regions under environmentally mediated selection and that seascape genomic approaches are especially useful for identifying robust locus-by-environment associations. © The Author (2016).","Adaptation; Genetic-environment association; Landscape; Oceanography; Population genomics; Remote sensing; Seascape genetics",,Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

We investigate spatial distributions of immunogenetic variation in American badger subspecies (Taxidea taxus), as a proxy for evaluating their evolutionary potential across the northern extent of the species’ range. We compared genetic structure of 20 microsatellites and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC DRB exon 2) to evaluate whether small, isolated populations show low adaptive polymorphism relative to large and well-connected populations. Our results suggest that gene flow plays a prominent role in shaping MHC polymorphism across large spatial scales, while the interplay between gene flow and selection was stronger towards the northern peripheries. The similarity of MHC alleles within subspecies relative to their neutral genetic differentiation suggests that adaptive divergence among subspecies can be maintained despite ongoing gene flow along subspecies boundaries. Neutral genetic diversity was low in small relative to large populations, but MHC diversity within individuals was high in small populations. Despite reduced neutral genetic variation, small and isolated populations harbour functional variation that likely contribute to the species evolutionary potential at the northern range.

Several mechanisms are discussed that may enhance the maintenance of genetic variation and evolutionary potential, which have been overlooked and should be considered in future theoretical development and predictive models: the prevalence of soft sweeps, polygenic basis of adaptation, balancing selection and transient polymorphisms, parallel evolution, as well as epigenetic variation. Research on fish population genomics has provided ample evidence for local adaptation at the genome level. Pervasive adaptive evolution, however, seems to almost never involve the fixation of beneficial alleles. Instead, adaptation apparently proceeds most commonly by soft sweeps entailing shifts in frequencies of alleles being shared between differentially adapted populations. One obvious factor contributing to the maintenance of standing genetic variation in the face of selective pressures is that adaptive phenotypic traits are most often highly polygenic, and consequently the response to selection should derive mostly from allelic co-variances among causative loci rather than pronounced allele frequency changes. Balancing selection in its various forms may also play an important role in maintaining adaptive genetic variation and the evolutionary potential of species to cope with environmental change. A large body of literature on fishes also shows that repeated evolution of adaptive phenotypes is a ubiquitous evolutionary phenomenon that seems to occur most often via different genetic solutions, further adding to the potential options of species to cope with a changing environment. Moreover, a paradox is emerging from recent fish studies whereby populations of highly reduced effective population sizes and impoverished genetic diversity can apparently retain their adaptive potential in some circumstances. Although more empirical support is needed, several recent studies suggest that epigenetic variation could account for this apparent paradox. Therefore, epigenetic variation should be fully integrated with considerations pertaining to role of soft sweeps, polygenic and balancing selection, as well as repeated adaptation involving different genetic basis towards improving models predicting the evolutionary potential of species to cope with a changing world. © 2016 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles","adaptation; conservation; environmental change; parallel evolution; population genomics; RADseq","adaptation; allele; animal; environment; evolution; fish; gene frequency; genetic epigenesis; genetic polymorphism; genetic selection; genetic variation; genetics; metagenomics; phenotype; population density; Adaptation, Biological; Alleles; Animals; Biological Evolution; Environment; Epigenesis, Genetic; Fishes; Gene Frequency; Genetic Variation; Metagenomics; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Genetic; Population Density; Selection, Genetic",Article,"",Scopus

Uncovering the level of migratory connectivity is crucial for effective conservation actions and for understanding of the evolution of local adaptations and migratory routes. Here we investigate migration patterns in a passerine bird, the great reed warbler Acrocephalus arundinaceus, over its wide Western Palearctic breeding range using geolocators from Spain, Sweden, Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Turkey. We found moderate migratory connectivity: a highly significant spatial structure in the connections between breeding and sub-Saharan non-breeding grounds, but at the same time a partial overlap between individual populations, particularly along the Gulf of Guinea where the majority of birds from the Spanish, Swedish and Czech populations spent their non-breeding period. The post-breeding migration routes were similar in direction and rather parallel for the five populations. Birds from Turkey showed the most distinctive migratory routes and sub-Saharan non-breeding range, with a post-breeding migration to east Africa and, together with birds from Bulgaria, a previously unknown pre-breeding migration over the Arabian Peninsula indicating counter-clockwise loop migration. The distances between breeding and sub-Saharan non-breeding sites, as well as between first and final sub-Saharan non-breeding sites, differed among populations. However, the total speed of migration did not differ significantly between populations; neither during post-breeding migration in autumn, nor pre-breeding migration in spring. There was also no significant relationship between the total speed of migration and distance between breeding and non-breeding sites (neither post- nor pre-breeding) and, surprisingly, the total speed of migration generally did not differ significantly between post-breeding and pre-breeding migration. Future challenges include understanding whether non-breeding environmental conditions may have influenced the differences in migratory patterns that we observed between populations, and to which extent non-breeding habitat fluctuations and loss may affect population sizes of migrants. © 2016 The Authors",,"breeding population; connectivity; environmental conditions; evolutionary biology; habitat fragmentation; local adaptation; migration; migration route; migratory behavior; Palearctic Ecozone; passerine; population size; spatiotemporal analysis; Arabian Peninsula; Bulgaria; Czech Republic; East Africa; Spain; Sub-Saharan Africa; Sweden; Turkey; Acrocephalus arundinaceus; Aves; Passeriformes",Article,"",Scopus

Here, we used a combination of common garden phenotyping for a variety of growth, plant architecture, and seed traits, along with single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping to characterize range-wide patterns of diversity in 15 populations of wild sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) sampled along a latitudinal gradient in central North America. We analyzed geographic patterns of phenotypic diversity, quantified levels of within-population SNP diversity, and also determined the extent of population structure across the range of this species. We then used these data to identify significantly over-differentiated loci as indicators of genomic regions that likely contribute to local adaptation. Results: Traits including flowering time, plant height, and seed oil composition (i.e., percentage of saturated fatty acids) were significantly correlated with latitude, and thus differentiated northern vs. southern populations. Average pairwise FST was found to be 0.21, and a STRUCTURE analysis identified two significant clusters that largely separated northern and southern individuals. The significant FST outliers included a SNP in HaFT2, a flowering time gene that has been previously shown to co-localize with flowering time QTL, and which exhibits a known cline in gene expression. Conclusions: Latitudinal differentiation in both phenotypic traits and SNP allele frequencies is observed across wild sunflower populations in central North America. Such differentiation may play an important adaptive role across the range of this species, and could facilitate adaptation to a changing climate. © 2016 The Author(s).","Latitudinal variation; Local adaptation; Phenotypic differentiation; Population genetics; Sunflower","plant protein; classification; gene frequency; genetic selection; genetic variation; genetics; genotype; phenotype; single nucleotide polymorphism; sunflower; Gene Frequency; Genetic Variation; Genotype; Helianthus; Phenotype; Plant Proteins; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Selection, Genetic",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

One of the most prominent questions in invasion genetics is how invasive populations can overcome genetic founder effects to establish stable populations after colonization of new habitats. High native genetic diversity and multiple introductions are expected to increase genetic diversity and adaptive potential in the invasive range. Our aim was to identify the European source populations of Frangula alnus (glossy buckthorn), an ornamental and highly invasive woody species that was deliberately introduced into North America at the end of the 18th century. A second aim of this study was to assess the adaptive potential as an explanation for the invasion success of this species. Methods Using a set of annotated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were assigned a putative function based on sequence comparison with model species, a total of 38 native European and 21 invasive North American populations were subjected to distance-based structure and assignment analyses combined with population genomic tools. Genetic diversity at SNPs with ecologically relevant functions was considered as a proxy for adaptive potential. Key Results Patterns of invasion coincided with early modern transatlantic trading routes. Multiple introductions through transatlantic trade from a limited number of European port regions to American urban areas led to the establishment of bridgehead populations with high allelic richness and expected heterozygosity, allowing continuous secondary migration to natural areas. Conclusions Targeted eradication of the urban populations, where the highest genetic diversity and adaptive potential were observed, offers a promising strategy to arrest further invasion of native American prairies and forests. © The Author 2016.

In some cases, however, morphological evolution can obscure the taxonomic status of recently founded populations. Here, we use molecular markers to show that an anchialinelake-restricted population of seahorses, originally identified as Hippocampus reidi, appears on the basis of DNA data to be Hippocampus erectus. We collected seahorses from Sweetings Pond, on Eleuthera Island, Bahamas, during the summer of 2014. We measured morphological traits and sequenced 2 genes, cytochrome b and ribosomal protein S7, from 19 seahorses in our sample. On the basis of morphology, Sweetings Pond seahorses could not be assigned definitively to either of the 2 species of seahorse, H. reidi and H. erectus, that occur in marine waters surrounding the Bahamas. However, our DNA-based phylogenetic analysis showed that the Sweetings Pond fish were firmly nested within the H. erectus clade with a Bayesian posterior probability greater than 0.99. Thus, Sweetings Pond seahorses most recently shared a common ancestor with H. erectus populations from the Western Atlantic. Interestingly, the seahorses from Sweetings Pond differ morphologically from other marine populations of H. erectus in having a more even torso to tail length ratio. The substantial habitat differences between Sweetings Pond and the surrounding coastal habitat make Sweetings Pond seahorses particularly interesting from the perspectives of conservation, local adaptation, and incipient speciation. © The American Genetic Association 2016.","Cytochrome b; Fish; Genetics; Hippocampus erectus; Isolated population; Lake; Nuclear gene S7; Seahorse","cytochrome b; molecular marker; ribosome protein; ribosome protein s7; unclassified drug; cytochrome b; adult; animal experiment; Article; cladistics; female; gene sequence; genetic variability; Hippocampus erectus; Hippocampus reidi; horse; local adaptation; male; morphological trait; nonhuman; phylogeny; population genetics; priority journal; species differentiation; tail; trunk; anatomy and histology; animal; Bayes theorem; classification; genetic variation; genetics; lake; Smegmamorpha; Animals; Bayes Theorem; Cytochromes b; Genetic Variation; Lakes; Phylogeny; Smegmamorpha",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus

That many species’ geographic range limits are coincident with niche limits suggests limited evolutionary potential of marginal populations to adapt to conditions experienced beyond the range. We provide a test of range limit theory by combining population genetic analysis of microsatellite polymorphisms with a transplant experiment within, at the edge of, and 60 km beyond the northern range of a coastal dune plant. Contrary to expectations, lifetime fitness increased toward the range limit with highest fitness achieved by most populations at and beyond the range edge. Genetic differentiation among populations was strong, with very low, nondirectional gene flow suggesting range limitation via constraints to dispersal. In contrast, however, local adaptation was negligible, and a distance-dependent decline in fitness only occurred for those populations furthest from home when planted beyond the range limit. These results challenge a commonly held assumption that stable range limits match niche limits, but also raise questions about the unique value of peripheral populations in expanding species’ geographical ranges. © 2016 The Author(s).

However, few studies consider how phenotypic traits vary with regard to neutral genetic partitioning along ecological gradients. Here, we present the first detailed investigation of lake trout Salvelinus namaycush that considers variation as a cline rather than discriminatory among ecotypes. Genetic and phenotypic traits organized along common ecological gradients of water depth and geographic distance provide important insights into diversification processes in a lake with high levels of human disturbance from over-fishing. Results: Four putative lake trout ecotypes could not be distinguished using population genetic methods, despite morphological differences. Neutral genetic partitioning in lake trout was stronger along a gradient of water depth, than by locality or ecotype. Contemporary genetic migration patterns were consistent with isolation-by-depth. Historical gene flow patterns indicated colonization from shallow to deep water. Comparison of phenotypic (Pst) and neutral genetic variation (Fst) revealed that morphological traits related to swimming performance (e.g., buoyancy, pelvic fin length) departed more strongly from neutral expectations along a depth gradient than craniofacial feeding traits. Elevated phenotypic variance with increasing water depth in pelvic fin length indicated possible ongoing character release and diversification. Finally, differences in early growth rate and asymptotic fish length across depth strata may be associated with limiting factors attributable to cold deep-water environments. Conclusion: We provide evidence of reductions in gene flow and divergent natural selection associated with water depth in Lake Superior. Such information is relevant for documenting intraspecific biodiversity in the largest freshwater lake in the world for a species that recently lost considerable genetic diversity and is now in recovery. Unknown is whether observed patterns are a result of an early stage of incipient speciation, gene flow-selection equilibrium, or reverse speciation causing formerly divergent ecotypes to collapse into a single gene pool. © 2016 The Author(s).","Adaptation; Geometric morphometrics; Intraspecific variation; Lake Superior; Microsatellite DNA; Multiple coinertia analysis; Phenotype","divergence; ecotype; environmental gradient; freshwater ecosystem; gene flow; genetic marker; genetic variation; intraspecific variation; local adaptation; morphology; morphometry; phenotypic plasticity; salmonid; swimming behavior; water depth; Great Lakes [North America]; Lake Superior; Pisces; Salvelinus namaycush; water; animal; ecosystem; gene flow; genetic selection; genetic variation; genetics; geography; lake; phenotype; population density; population genetics; salmonine; Animals; Ecosystem; Gene Flow; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Geography; Lakes; Phenotype; Population Density; Selection, Genetic; Trout; Water",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Currently, there is limited comparative genomics insight into the evolution of dietary specializations in mammals. Due to recent advances in sequencing technologies, we were able to perform in-depth whole genome analyses of representatives of these three dietary groups. Results: We investigated the evolution of carnivory by comparing 18 representative genomes from across Mammalia with carnivorous, omnivorous, and herbivorous dietary specializations, focusing on Felidae (domestic cat, tiger, lion, cheetah, and leopard), Hominidae, and Bovidae genomes. We generated a new high-quality leopard genome assembly, as well as two wild Amur leopard whole genomes. In addition to a clear contraction in gene families for starch and sucrose metabolism, the carnivore genomes showed evidence of shared evolutionary adaptations in genes associated with diet, muscle strength, agility, and other traits responsible for successful hunting and meat consumption. Additionally, an analysis of highly conserved regions at the family level revealed molecular signatures of dietary adaptation in each of Felidae, Hominidae, and Bovidae. However, unlike carnivores, omnivores and herbivores showed fewer shared adaptive signatures, indicating that carnivores are under strong selective pressure related to diet. Finally, felids showed recent reductions in genetic diversity associated with decreased population sizes, which may be due to the inflexible nature of their strict diet, highlighting their vulnerability and critical conservation status. Conclusions: Our study provides a large-scale family level comparative genomic analysis to address genomic changes associated with dietary specialization.

In this study, we assessed the relative importance of spatial distribution, ocean currents and sea surface temperature (SST) on patterns of putatively neutral and adaptive genetic variation among American lobster from 19 locations using population differentiation (PD) approaches combined with environmental association (EA) analyses. First, PD approaches (using bayescan, arlequin and outflank) found 28 outlier SNPs putatively under divergent selection and 9770 neutral SNPs in common. Redundancy analysis revealed that spatial distribution, ocean current-mediated larval connectivity and SST explained 31.7% of the neutral genetic differentiation, with ocean currents driving the majority of this relationship (21.0%). After removing the influence of spatial distribution, no SST were significant for putatively neutral genetic variation whereas minimum annual SST still had a significant impact and explained 8.1% of the putatively adaptive genetic variation. Second, EA analyses (using Pearson correlation tests, bayescenv and lfmm) jointly identified seven SNPs as candidates for thermal adaptation. Covariation at these SNPs was assessed with a spatial multivariate analysis that highlighted a significant temperature association, after accounting for the influence of spatial distribution. Among the 505 candidate SNPs detected by at least one of the three approaches, we discovered three polymorphisms located in genes previously shown to play a role in thermal adaptation.

However, different lineages or populations inhabiting distinct bioregions within a species' distributional range can retain unique genetic diversity that could result in distinct adaptive capacities. A recent, large, climate-correlated distributional range contraction occurred at the southern edge of the intertidal macroalga Fucus vesiculosus, causing loss of genetic diversity unique to the southern clade. We tested for differential selective constraints and signs of local adaptation to thermal stress in the two genetic lineages. Location: Iberian Atlantic shores. Methods: We performed a series of common garden experiments and a field reciprocal transplant. Results: In the laboratory, southern F. vesiculosus showed higher resilience to heat stress than northern individuals. On the southwest coast of Portugal, local individuals grew more than those transplanted from the northern range; in the north of Portugal, growth rates did not differ significantly between lineages. Conclusions: We present evidence for unique adaptive traits at the retreating edge of the species' distribution that could be lost if warming trends persist.

We studied experimentally the parental effects on the HT and size of vendace (Coregonus albula (L.)) and whitefish (C. lavaretus L.) larvae under short and long winter conditions using a full-factorial breeding design. Both parents significantly affected the HT of vendace, mostly by additive genetic effects, and the difference between short and long winter treatment was also significant. In whitefish, the female × male interaction was significant, implying non-additive genetic effects. The maximum range of the HT of eggs between parent pairs within certain winter condition was 3 weeks and was clearly lower than the potential range for the temperature-adjusted HT. The size of eggs or hatched larvae did not correlate with the HT in either of the species.

Because sexual conflict is common in the suborder Calanoida, we tested whether sexual selection drives differentiation between populations. We conducted mating experiments between two geographically adjacent but morphologically different populations of the calanoid copepod Acanthodiaptomus denticornis from the French lakes Lac Pavin and Lac de Montcineyre. We detected sex-specific inter-population differences in mating success. In particular, Lac de Montcineyre males (M males) exhibited a higher mating success in short matings than Lac Pavin males (P males). In contrast to M females, P females showed population-density-dependent fecundity. Furthermore, survival of P females decreased in inter-population groups. We suggest that planktivorous glassworm larvae, which inhabit only Lac de Montcineyre, impose selection on copulating pairs of copepods. This may adaptively increase the ability of M males to fertilize eggs during short matings and indirectly decrease sensitivity of M females to male coercion.

Evaluating population-level impacts of sublethal exposure concentrations is, however, complex and confounded by other environmental pressures. Applying effect measures derived from laboratory-based chemical exposures to impacts in wild fish populations is constrained by uncertainty on how biochemical response measures (biomarkers) translate into health outcomes, lack of available data for chronic exposures and the many uncertainties in available fish population models. Furthermore, wild fish show phenotypic plasticity and local adaptations can occur that adds geographic and temporal variance on responses. Such population-level factors are rarely considered in the chemical risk assessment process and can probably be derived only from studies on wild fish. Molecular technologies, including microsatellite and SNP genotyping, and RNASeq for gene expression studies, are advancing our understanding of mechanisms of eco-toxicological response, tolerance, adaptation and selection in wild populations. We examine critically the application of such approaches with examples including using microsatellites that has identified roach (Rutilus rutilus) populations living in rivers contaminated with sewage effluents that are self-sustaining, and studies of stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) that have identified genomic regions under selection putatively related to pollution tolerance. Integrating data on biological effects between laboratory-based studies and wild populations, and building understanding on adaptive responses to sublethal exposure are some of the priority research areas for more effective evaluation of population risks and resilience to contaminant exposure. © 2015 The Authors.

Unfortunately for high gene flow species which may display low, but statistically significant population structure, there is no clear consensus on the level of differentiation required to resolve distinct stocks. The use of fine-scale neutral and adaptive variation, considered together with environmental data can offer additional insights to this problem. Genome-wide genetic data (4,123 SNPs), together with an independent hydrodynamic particle dispersal model were used to inform farm and fishery management in the Fijian black-lip pearl oyster Pinctada margaritifera, where comprehensive fishery management is lacking, and the sustainability of exploitation uncertain. Weak fine-scale patterns of population structure were detected, indicative of broad-scale panmixia among wild oysters, while a hatchery-sourced farmed population exhibited a higher degree of genetic divergence (Fst = 0.0850-0.102). This hatchery-produced population had also experienced a bottleneck (NeLD = 5.1; 95% C.I. = [5.1-5.3]); compared to infinite NeLD estimates for all wild oysters. Simulation of larval transport pathways confirmed the existence of broad-scale mixture by surface ocean currents, correlating well with finescale patterns of population structuring. Fst outlier tests failed to detect large numbers of loci supportive of selection, with 2-5 directional outlier SNPs identified (average Fst = 0.116). The lack of biologically significant population genetic structure, absence of evidence for local adaptation and larval dispersal simulation, all indicate the existence of a single genetic stock of P. margaritifera in the Fiji Islands. This approach using independent genomic and oceanographic tools has allowed fundamental insights into stock structure in this species, with transferability to other highly-dispersive marine taxa for their conservation and management. © 2016 Lal et al.

This phenomenon would be accentuated for species with large range areas, with discontinuities and marginal populations. We herein compare the genetic patterns of central populations of Coccinella septempunctata L. with those of two phenotypically differentiated populations considered as rear-edge populations and subspecies based on phenotype (Algeria and Japan). According to the central-marginal model and expected characteristics of rear-edge populations, we hypothesize that these rear-edge populations have (1) a reduced genetic diversity, resulting from their relative isolation over long periods of time, (2) a higher population genetic differentiation, explained by low contemporary gene flow levels, and (3) a relationship between genetic diversity characteristics and phenotypes, due to historical isolation and/or local adaptation. Based on genotyping of 28 populations for 18 microsatellite markers, several levels of regional genetic diversity and differentiation are observed between and within populations, according to their localization: low within-population genetic diversity and higher genetic differentiation of rear-edge populations. The genetic structuring clearly dissociates the Algerian and Eastern Asia populations from the others. Geographical patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation support the hypothesis of the central-marginal model. The pattern observed is in agreement with the phenotypic structure across species range. A clear genetic break between populations of Algeria, the Eastern Asia, and the remaining populations is a dominant feature of the data. Differential local adaptations, absence of gene flow between marginal and central populations, and/or incapacity to mate after colonization, have contributed to their distinct genotypic and phenotypic characteristics. © 2016 The Authors.

Females in spawning runs tended to be larger and older than males, but growth rates were similar between sexes. As predicted, females had larger and more lipid-rich gonads and livers, and lower somatic condition and muscle lipid concentrations than males. Within populations, gonad size, fecundity, and egg size were related primarily to body size, and secondarily to indices of adult condition. Gonadosomatic index (GSI) increased with body size in females and declined with body size in males. Egg size increased with female size and declined with liver size and/or lipid content, whereas relative fecundity showed opposite trends. In contrast, egg lipid content appeared to be more strongly related to liver size and lipid content (positive effects) than to female size. Among populations, growth rate and muscle lipid concentration declined from south to north, but contrary to predictions, none of the reproductive traits examined showed strong covariation with environmental gradients.

However, evidence for local adaptation and phenotypic differentiation in highly mobile species, experiencing high levels of gene flow, is emerging. Assessing population genetic structure at different spatial scales is thus a crucial step towards understanding mechanisms underlying intraspecific differentiation and diversification. Here, we studied the population genetic structure of a highly mobile species - the great tit Parus major - at different spatial scales. We analysed 884 individuals from 30 sites across Europe including 10 close-by sites (&lt; 50 km), using 22 microsatellite markers. Overall we found a low but significant genetic differentiation among sites (FST = 0.008). Genetic differentiation was higher, and genetic diversity lower, in south-western Europe. These regional differences were statistically best explained by winter temperature. Overall, our results suggest that great tits form a single patchy metapopulation across Europe, in which genetic differentiation is independent of geographical distance and gene flow may be regulated by environmental factors via movements related to winter severity. This might have important implications for the evolutionary trajectories of sub-populations, especially in the context of climate change, and calls for future investigations of local differences in costs and benefits of philopatry at large scales. © 2016 The Linnean Society of London.","F-statistics; Isolation-by-distance; Latitude; Microsatellites; Parus major; Population genetic structure; Winter severity","divergence; evolutionary biology; gene flow; genetic differentiation; genetic marker; genetic structure; genetic variation; local adaptation; metapopulation; passerine; philopatry; severe weather; species diversity; statistical analysis; temperature effect; winter; Europe; Parus major",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus

However, genomic sites subject to directional selection stemming from variation in local environmental conditions can still show substantial genetic differentiation, yet these signatures can be hard to detect with low-throughput approaches. Using a pooled RAD-seq approach, we investigated genomewide patterns of genetic variability and differentiation within and among 20 populations of Atlantic herring in the Baltic Sea (and adjacent Atlantic sites), where previous low-throughput studies and/or studies based on few populations have found limited evidence for genetic differentiation. Stringent quality control was applied in the filtering of 1 791 254 SNPs, resulting in a final data set of 68 182 polymorphic loci. Clear differentiation was identified between Atlantic and Baltic populations in many genomic sites, while differentiation within the Baltic Sea area was weaker and geographically less structured. However, outlier analyses - whether including all populations or only those within the Baltic Sea - uncovered hundreds of directionally selected loci in which variability was associated with either salinity, temperature or both. Hence, our results support the view that although the degree of genetic differentiation among Baltic Sea herring populations is low, there are many genomic regions showing elevated divergence, apparently as a response to temperature- and salinity-related natural selection. As such, the results add to the increasing evidence of local adaptation in highly mobile marine organisms, and those in the young Baltic Sea in particular. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Clupea harengus; local adaptation; RAD-seq; salinity; SNP; temperature","adaptation; animal; Atlantic Ocean; biological model; DNA sequence; environment; gene flow; gene frequency; genetics; Perciformes; population genetics; single nucleotide polymorphism; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Atlantic Ocean; Environment; Gene Flow; Gene Frequency; Genetics, Population; Models, Genetic; Perciformes; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Sequence Analysis, DNA",Article,"",Scopus

It is hypothesized that selection will reduce energetic costs of osmoregulation in a population's native osmotic habitat, producing patterns of local adaptation. Killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus, occupy estuarine habitats where salinities range from fresh to seawater. Populations inhabiting an environmental salinity gradient differ in physiological traits associated with acclimation to acute salinity stress, consistent with local adaptation. Similarly, metabolic rates differ in populations adapted to different temperatures, but have not been studied in regard to salinity. We investigated evidence for local adaptation between populations of killifish native to fresh and brackish water habitats. Aerobic scope (the difference between minimum and maximum metabolic rates), excess post-exercise oxygen consumption, and swimming performance (time and distance to reach exhaustion) were used as proxies for fitness in fresh and brackish water treatments. Swimming performance results supported local adaptation; fish native to brackish water habitats performed significantly better than freshwater-native fish at high salinity while low salinity performance was similar between populations. However, results from metabolic measures did not support this conclusion; both populations showed an increase in resting metabolic rate and a decrease of aerobic scope in fresh water. Similarly, excess post-exercise oxygen consumption was higher for both populations in fresh than in brackish water. While swimming results suggest that environmentally dependent performance differences may be a result of selection in divergent osmotic environments, the differences between populations are not coupled with divergence in metabolic performance. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Aerobic scope; Excess post-exercise oxygen consumption; Fundulus heteroclitus; Local adaptation; Osmoregulation; Salinity","brackish water; fresh water; sea water; adult; aerobic exercise; aerobic scope; animal experiment; animal model; aquatic species; Article; controlled study; environmental temperature; exhaustion; fitness; Fundulus heteroclitus; killifish; local adaptation; marine environment; metabolic rate; nonhuman; osmoregulation; osmosis; oxygen consumption; physiological process; population; resting metabolic rate; salinity; salt stress; species habitat; swimming; task performance; adaptation; animal; basal metabolic rate; body weight; ecosystem; Fundulidae; Maryland; oxygen consumption; physiology; swimming; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Basal Metabolism; Body Weight; Ecosystem; Fresh Water; Fundulidae; Maryland; Osmoregulation; Oxygen Consumption; Salinity; Seawater; Swimming",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus

However, tests of local adaptation rarely consider multiple fitness-related traits although focus on a single component of fitness can be misleading. Here, we concomitantly examined genetic structure and co-divergence patterns of the trematode Coitocaecum parvum and its crustacean host Paracalliope fluviatilis among isolated populations using the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene (COI). We then performed experimental cross-infections between two genetically divergent host-parasite populations. Both hosts and parasites displayed genetic differentiation among populations, although genetic structure was less pronounced in the parasite. Data also supported a co-divergence scenario between C. parvum and P. fluviatilis potentially related to local co-adaptation. Results from cross-infections indicated that some parasite lineages seemed to be locally adapted to their sympatric (home) hosts in which they achieved higher infection and survival rates than in allopatric (away) amphipods. However, local, intrinsic host and parasite characteristics (host behavioural or immunological resistance to infections, parasite infectivity or growth rate) also influenced patterns of host-parasite interactions. For example, overall host vulnerability to C. parvum varied between populations, regardless of parasite origin (local vs. foreign), potentially swamping apparent local co-adaptation effects. Furthermore, local adaptation effects seemed trait specific; different components of parasite fitness (infection and survival rates, growth) responded differently to cross-infections. Overall, data show that genetic differentiation is not inevitably coupled with local adaptation, and that the latter must be interpreted with caution in a multi-trait context. © 2016 The Linnean Society of London.","Coitocaecum parvum; Cross-infections; Isolated host-parasite populations; Paracalliope fluviatilis; Sympatric versus allopatric hosts","amphipod; coevolution; fitness; genetic differentiation; genetic structure; host-parasite interaction; local adaptation; survival; vulnerability; Amphipoda; Crustacea; Trematoda",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus

Here, we explore the utility of an alternative approach - ""environmental correlation analysis, ECA,"" which tests for clines in allele frequencies across a gradient of an environmental selection pressure - to identify genes that have historically protected against death from malaria. We collected genotype data from 12,425 newborns on 57 candidate malaria resistance loci and 9,756 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected at random from across the genome, and examined their allele frequencies for geographic correlations with long-term malaria prevalence data based on 84,042 individuals living under different historical selection pressures from malaria in coastal Kenya. None of the 57 candidate SNPs showed significant (P < 0.05) correlations in allele frequency with local malaria transmission intensity after adjusting for population structure and multiple testing. In contrast, two of the random SNPs that had highly significant correlations (P < 0.01) were in genes previously linked to malaria resistance, namely, CDH13, encoding cadherin 13, and HS3ST3B1, encoding heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferase 3B1. Both proteins play a role in glycoprotein-mediated cell-cell adhesion which has been widely implicated in cerebral malaria, the most life-threatening form of this disease. Other top genes, including CTNND2 which encodes δ-catenin, a molecular partner to cadherin, were significantly enriched in cadherin-mediated pathways affecting inflammation of the brain vascular endothelium.

Occasionally there is a high recruitment of juveniles in Kattegat/Skagerrak, without leading to the rebuilding of adult cod stocks despite reduced fishing mortality. In a biophysical model of egg and larval drift, we examined the potential importance of extant and historical spawning grounds for recruitment of cod in the Kattegat/Skagerrak seas using data of spawning stock biomass from the 1970s and from today's reduced stocks. The results suggest that Kattegat in the 1970s relied on largely locally retained (83%) larvae with little annual variation in recruitment. Kattegat also provided a substantial proportion of larvae recruiting in Swedish Skagerrak (72%). This is in contrast to present conditions where the Kattegat spawning stock has been reduced by 94%, and Kattegat only provides 34% of locally retained larvae and 30% to Swedish Skagerrak. Instead, the protected area in the Öresund and the Belt Sea are expected today to provide most larvae recruiting in Kattegat. Also, the inflow of larvae from the North Sea to Skagerrak and Kattegat can be significant although highly variable between years, with a positive correlation to the North-Atlantic Oscillation index (NAO). The rebuilding of healthy spawning areas in the Kattegat may be key for restoring local cod stocks in both Kattegat and along the Skagerrak coast. This poses a management challenge if cod with local 'Kattegat' adaptations, e.g., in terms of egg density and migration patterns, are lost or reduced to non-resilient densities. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Gadus morhua; Biophysical model; Egg and larval dispersal; Kattegat; Local adaptation; Management; Overfishing; Skagerrak","annual variation; biomass; dispersal; egg; fishery management; juvenile; larva; local adaptation; overfishing; protected area; recruitment (population dynamics); spawning; teleost; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Kattegat; North Sea; Skagerrak; Gadus morhua",Article,"",Scopus

Here, we identified 27 556 single nucleotide polymorphisms for the small yellow croaker (Larimichthys polyactis) using restriction-site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing of 24 individuals from two populations. Significant sources of genetic variation were identified, with an average nucleotide diversity (π) of 0.00105 ± 0.000425 across individuals, and long-term effective population size was thus estimated to range between 26 172 and 261 716. According to the results, no differentiation between the two populations was detected based on the SNP data set of top quality score per contig or neutral loci. However, the two analysed populations were highly differentiated based on SNP data set of both top FST value per contig and the outlier SNPs. Moreover, local adaptation was highlighted by an FST-based outlier tests implemented in LOSITAN and a total of 538 potentially locally selected SNPs were identified. blast2go annotation of contigs containing the outlier SNPs yielded hits for 37 (66%) of 56 significant blastx matches.

The majority of this entry is concerned with methods for detecting positive selection within sequences that code for proteins. This is partly due to the clear functional importance of proteins. But it is also because the 'footprint' of functional constraint is easier to detect in coding DNA. Eukaryotic genomes also contain vast amounts of noncoding DNA, and some unknown proportion is responsible for regulating protein expression. Indeed, many believe that evolution of regulatory sequences drives phenotypic evolution. Accordingly, a section of this entry is devoted to investigating noncoding sequence evolution between species.

Here we describe a new species, S. plana, through incubation of non-calcified cysts from sediments collected in the South China Sea and Caspian Sea. The vegetative cells consist of a conical epitheca and a rounded hypotheca with the plate formula of Po, X, 4′, 3a, 7′′, 5C+t, 5S, 5′′′, 2′′′′. It differs from other Scrippsiella species by its flattened body in dorsoventral view and a small first anterior intercalary (1a) plate (half the size of plate 3a). Scrippsiellaplana strains from the South China Sea and Caspian Sea share identical internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences, and show phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation in growth rate at various salinities, consistent with the environments in which they originated. In addition, two strains of S. spinifera were obtained by incubating ellipsoid cysts with calcareous spines from sediments collected along the Turkish and Hawaiian coast. They also share identical ITS sequences and differ from Duboscquodinium collinii (a parasite of tintinnids) only at two base pair positions (in the ITS2 region). Molecular phylogeny based on ITS and large subunit ribosomal DNA (LSU rDNA) sequences revealed that S. plana was nested within the Calciodinellum (CAL) clade and S. spinifera within the S. trochoidea (STR) clade. The phylogenetic position of ‘Peridinium’ wisconsinense is reported for the first time, which supports multiple transitions of the Peridiniales to freshwater. © 2016 British Phycological Society.","calcareous dinoflagellates; cysts; Duboscquodinium collinii; growth; ITS; Peridinium wisconsinense","coastal sediment; cyst; growth rate; incubation; local adaptation; microbial activity; phenotypic plasticity; phylogenetics; population distribution; protist; Caspian Sea; Hawaii [United States]; Pacific Ocean; South China Sea; Turkey; United States; Calciodinellum; Dinophyceae; Epitheca; Peridiniales; Peridinium; Peridinium wisconsinense; Scrippsiella; Scrippsiella trochoidea; Tintinnida",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus

Here, genomic regions of elevated divergencewere observed on three chromosomes of the highlymobile fishAtlantic cod (Gadusmorhua) within geographically fine-scaled coastal areas. The ""genomic islands"" extended at least 5, 9.5, and 13megabases on linkage groups 2, 7, and 12, respectively, and coincided with large blocks of linkage disequilibrium. For each of these three chromosomes, pairs of segregating, highly divergent alleleswere identified, with little or no gene exchange between them. These patterns of recombination and divergencemirror genomic signatures previously described for large polymorphic inversions,which have been shown to repress recombination across extensive chromosomal segments. The lack of genetic exchange permits divergence between noninverted and inverted chromosomes in spite of gene flow. For the rearrangements on linkage groups 2 and 12, allelic frequency shifts between coastal and oceanic environments suggest a role in ecological adaptation, in agreement with recently reported associations between molecular variation within these genomic regions and temperature, oxygen, and salinity levels. Elevated genetic differentiation in these genomic regions has previously been described on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, and we therefore suggest that these polymorphisms are involved in adaptive divergence across the species distributional range. © The Author 2016.","Chromosomal rearrangements; Ecological adaptation; Gene flow; Marine organisms; Population genomics; Structural polymorphisms","adaptation; animal; Atlantic cod; chromosome; chromosome inversion; gene flow; gene linkage disequilibrium; genetics; genome; metagenomics; physiology; single nucleotide polymorphism; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Chromosome Inversion; Chromosomes; Gadus morhua; Gene Flow; Genome; Linkage Disequilibrium; Metagenomics; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Thus, it is important to investigate patterns of both phenotypic and genetic variations among populations to reveal the respective roles of these two types of factors in driving population differentiation. Here, we test for evidence of phenotypic and genetic structure across populations of a passerine bird (Zosterops borbonicus) distributed along a steep elevational gradient on the island of Réunion. Using 11 microsatellite loci screened in 401 individuals from 18 localities distributed along the gradient, we found that genetic differentiation occurred at two spatial levels: (i) between two main population groups corresponding to highland and lowland areas, respectively, and (ii) within each of these two groups. In contrast, several morphological traits varied gradually along the gradient. Comparison of neutral genetic differentiation (FST) and phenotypic differentiation (PST) showed that PST largely exceeds FST at several morphological traits, which is consistent with a role for local adaptation in driving morphological divergence along the gradient. Overall, our results revealed an area of secondary contact midway up the gradient between two major, cryptic, population groups likely diverged in allopatry. Remarkably, local adaptation has shaped phenotypic differentiation irrespective of population history, resulting in different patterns of variation along the elevational gradient. Our findings underscore the importance of understanding both historical and selective factors when trying to explain variation along environmental gradients. © 2016 European Society for Evolutionary Biology.","Zosterops borbonicus; Altitudinal gradient; Local adaptation; Mascarene Islands; Microsatellites; Natural selection; PST/FST comparisons; Population history; Réunion grey white-eye; Secondary contact","altitude; differentiation; environmental gradient; eye; genetic differentiation; genetic marker; historical ecology; local adaptation; morphology; natural selection; passerine; phenotype; population structure; Mascarene Islands; Aves; Passeriformes; Zosteropidae; Zosterops borbonicus; microsatellite DNA; adaptation; altitude; animal; evolution; genetic selection; genetic variation; genetics; island (geological); Passeriformes; phenotype; physiology; Adaptation, Physiological; Altitude; Animals; Biological Evolution; Genetic Variation; Islands; Microsatellite Repeats; Passeriformes; Phenotype; Selection, Genetic",Article,"",Scopus

However, the genomic architecture underlying such behavioral ecotypes is unclear. Here, we have analyzed more than 8.000 polymorphic SNPs distributed throughout all 23 linkage groups and show that loci putatively under selection are localized within three distinct genomic regions, each of several megabases long, covering approximately 4% of the Atlantic cod genome. These regions likely represent genomic inversions. The frequency of these distinct regions differ markedly between the ecotypes, spawning in the vicinity of each other, which contrasts with the low level of divergence in the rest of the genome. The observed patterns strongly suggest that these chromosomal rearrangements are instrumental in local adaptation and separation of Atlantic cod populations, leaving footprints of large genomic regions under selection.

The so-called 8.2 ka event was one of the most pronounced and abrupt Holocene cold and arid events. The 9.2 ka event was similar, albeit of a smaller magnitude. Both events affected the Northern Hemisphere climate and caused cooling and aridification in Southwest Asia. Yet, the impacts of the 8.2 and 9.2 ka events on early farming communities in this region are not well understood. Current hypotheses for an effect of the 8.2 ka event vary from large-scale site abandonment and migration (including the Neolithisation of Europe) to continuation of occupation and local adaptation, while impacts of the 9.2 ka have not previously been systematically studied. In this paper, we present a thorough assessment of available, quality-checked radiocarbon (14C) dates for sites from Southwest Asia covering the time interval between 9500 and 7500 cal BP, which we interpret in combination with archaeological evidence. In this way, the synchronicity between changes observed in the archaeological record and the rapid climate events is tested. It is shown that there is no evidence for a simultaneous and widespread collapse, large-scale site abandonment, or migration at the time of the events. However, there are indications for local adaptation.

Recently, work has focused on understanding how selection drives trait divergence, and subsequently reproductive isolation. ""Immigrant inviability,"" a barrier that arises from selection against immigrants in their nonnative environment, appears to be of particular importance. Although immigrant inviability is likely ubiquitous, we know relatively little about how selection acts on traits to drive immigrant inviability, and how important immigrant inviability is at early-versus-late stages of divergence. We present a study evaluating the role of predation in the evolution of immigrant inviability in recently diverged population pairs and a well-established species pair of Brachyrhaphis fishes. We evaluate performance in a high-predation environment by assessing survival in the presence of a predator, and swimming endurance in a low-predation environment. We find strong signatures of local adaptation and immigrant inviability of roughly the same magnitude both early and late in divergence. We find remarkably conserved selection for burst-speed swimming (important in predator evasion), and selection for increased size in low-predation environments.

Recent genomic research of modern Tibetan gene pool diversity provides evidence of numerous different founding haplogroups among populations. Age estimates suggest that much of the Tibetan gene pool is the product of Holocene migration and admixture, but at least one distinct ancestral haplotype may pre-date the last glacial maximum. Key genes conferring high-altitude adaptation to Tibetan populations suggest that those populations diverged from Han Chinese ancestors between ~ 8-18 cal ka BP. Diverse Upper Paleolithic technological packages existed in different regions around the margins of the Plateau that could have been carried up by potential early colonizers. However, archeological evidence of early (pre-Neolithic) occupation on the Plateau itself is remarkably uniform, consisting of small short-term camps with a mixed lithic technology featuring simple flakes and shatter, microblades and microcores, larger blades or bladelets, discoidal tablet cores, and occasional bipolar pebble cores; well-dated sites are all post-glacial in age. A simple biogeographic model, the ""up from the north"" hypothesis, asserts that human groups best suited to colonizing the harsh alpine Plateau environments would have been those adapted to life typical of higher latitudes, and those advantaged northern-latitude colonizers routinely carried microlithic technology with them in hunting the same Palearctic steppe fauna found on the Plateau. The archeological record of early colonizers on the Plateau should therefore be dominated by the north Asian epi-Paleolithic technological package in which microblades were a key component. Complications to this simple model, and possible scenarios addressing the disparity between the evidence from historical genetics and the archeological record, are considered. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The genetic structure of parasites is expected to conform to that of their hosts, because host dispersal is generally assumed to drive parasite dispersal. Here, we used a meta-analysis to test this paradigm and determine whether traits related to host dispersal correctly predict the spatial co-distribution of host and parasite genetic variation. We compiled data from empirical work on local adaptation and host-parasite population genetic structure from a wide range of taxonomic groups. We found that genetic differentiation was significantly lower in parasites than in hosts, suggesting that dispersal may often be higher for parasites. A significant correlation in the pairwise genetic differentiation of hosts and parasites was evident, but surprisingly weak. These results were largely explained by parasite reproductive mode, the proportion of free-living stages in the parasite life cycle and the geographical extent of the study; variables related to host dispersal were poor predictors of genetic patterns. Our results do not dispel the paradigm that parasite population genetic structure depends on host dispersal.

We used riverscape genetics modelling to assess whether climatic and habitat variables were related to neutral and adaptive patterns of genetic differentiation (population-specific and pairwise FST) within five metapopulations (79 populations, 4583 individuals) of steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in the Columbia River Basin, USA. Using 151 putatively neutral and 29 candidate adaptive SNP loci, we found that climate-related variables (winter precipitation, summer maximum temperature, winter highest 5% flow events and summer mean flow) best explained neutral and adaptive patterns of genetic differentiation within metapopulations, suggesting that climatic variation likely influences both demography (neutral variation) and local adaptation (adaptive variation). However, we did not observe consistent relationships between climate variables and FST across all metapopulations, underscoring the need for replication when extrapolating results from one scale to another (e.g. basin-wide to the metapopulation scale). Sensitivity analysis (leave-one-population-out) revealed consistent relationships between climate variables and FST within three metapopulations; however, these patterns were not consistent in two metapopulations likely due to small sample sizes (N = 10).

At rear edges (warmer, low latitude range margins), the consequences of small variations in environmental conditions can be magnified, producing large negative effects on species ranges. A major outcome of shifts in distributions that only recently received attention is the potential to reduce the levels of intra-specific diversity and consequently the global evolutionary and adaptive capacity of species to face novel disturbances. This is particularly important for low dispersal marine species, such as kelps, that generally retain high and unique genetic diversity at rear ranges resulting from long-term persistence, while ranges shifts during climatic glacial/interglacial cycles. Using ecological niche modelling, we (1) infer the major environmental forces shaping the distribution of a cold-temperate kelp, Laminaria hyperborea (Gunnerus) Foslie, and we (2) predict the effect of past climate changes in shaping regions of long-term persistence (i.e., climatic refugia), where this species might hypothetically harbour higher genetic diversity given the absence of bottlenecks and local extinctions over the long term. We further (3) assessed the consequences of future climate for the fate of L. hyperborea using different scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions (RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5). Results show NW Iberia, SW Ireland and W English Channel, Faroe Islands and S Iceland, as regions where L. hyperborea may have persisted during past climate extremes until present day. All predictions for the future showed expansions to northern territories coupled with the significant loss of suitable habitats at low latitude range margins, where long-term persistence was inferred (e.g., NW Iberia). This pattern was particularly evident in the most agressive scenario of climate change (RCP 8.5), likely driving major biodiversity loss, changes in ecosystem functioning and the impoverishment of the global gene pool of L. hyperborea. Because no genetic baseline is currently available for this species, our results may represent a first step in informing conservation and mitigation strategies. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate change; Ecologial niche modelling; Kelp forests; Laminaria hyperborea; Local persistence; Phylogeography; Range shifts","Biodiversity; Conservation; Ecology; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Population distribution; Kelp forests; Laminaria hyperborea; Local persistence; Phylogeography; RANGE shifts; Climate change; brown alga; climate change; ecological modeling; kelp forest; marine ecosystem; niche; persistence; phylogeography; population distribution; Article; biodiversity; climate change; ecological niche; ecosystem; environmental factor; evolutionary adaptation; gene pool; genetic conservation; genetic variability; glaciation; greenhouse gas; habitat quality; Iceland; interglacial; intraspecific variation; Ireland; kelp; Laminaria; Laminaria hyperborea; latitude; nonhuman; prediction; species distribution; species extinction; species refuge; cold; demography; Europe; Laminaria; phylogeography; physiology; sea; English Channel; Faroe Islands; Iberian Peninsula; Iceland; Ireland; Laminaria hyperborea; Laminariales; Climate Change; Cold Temperature; Demography; Ecosystem; Europe; Laminaria; Oceans and Seas; Phylogeography",Article,"",Scopus

We tested this prediction using natural populations of zooplankton from lakes in Connecticut that span a large gradient in the temporal dynamics of predator-induced mortality. We reared more than 120 clones of Daphnia ambigua from nine lakes for multiple generations in the presence/ absence of predator cues.We found that temporal variation in mortality selects for within-generation plasticity while consistently strong (or weak) mortality selects for increased TGP.

However, we know surprisingly little about the genetic mechanisms underlying the locally adapted traits involved in ecotype formation. The genetic architecture underlying locally adapted traits dictates how an organism will respond to environmental selection pressures, and has major implications for evolutionary ecology, conservation, and crop breeding. To understand the genetic architecture underlying the divergence of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) ecotypes, we constructed a genetic mapping population through a four-way outbred cross between two northern upland and two southern lowland accessions. Trait segregation in this mapping population was largely consistent with multiple independent loci controlling the suite of traits that characterizes ecotype divergence. We assembled a joint linkage map using ddRADseq, and mapped quantitative trait loci (QTL) for traits that are divergent between ecotypes, including flowering time, plant size, physiological processes, and disease resistance. Overall, we found that most QTL had small to intermediate effects. While we identified colocalizing QTL for multiple traits, we did not find any large-effect QTL that clearly controlled multiple traits through pleiotropy or tight physical linkage. These results indicate that ecologically important traits in switchgrass have a complex genetic basis, and that similar loci may underlie divergence across the geographic range of the ecotypes. © 2016 Milano et al.","Flowering time; Genetic architecture; Local adaptation; QTL; Trait syndromes","Article; correlation analysis; ecotype; flowering; gene mapping; genetic linkage; genotype; infection resistance; infection sensitivity; nonhuman; outbred strain; Panicum virgatum; phenotype; physiological process; pleiotropy; population; quantitative trait locus; rust (plant disease); species diversity",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

The Northeast Arctic cod (NEAC) population in the Barents Sea undertakes annual spawning migrations to the northern Norwegian coast. Although spawning occurs sympatrically with the stationary Norwegian coastal cod (NCC), phenotypic and genetic differences between NEAC and NCC are maintained. In this study, we resolve the enigma by revealing the mechanisms underlying these differences. Extended linkage disequilibrium (LD) and population divergence were demonstrated in a 17.4-Mb region on linkage group 1 (LG1) based on genotypes of 494 SNPs from 192 parents of farmed families of NEAC, NCC or NEACxNCC crosses. Linkage analyses revealed two adjacent inversions within this region that repress meiotic recombination in NEACxNCC crosses. We identified a NEAC-specific haplotype consisting of 186 SNPs that was fixed in NEAC sampled from the Barents Sea, but segregating under Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium in eight NCC stocks. Comparative genomic analyses determine the NEAC configuration of the inversions to be the derived state and date it to ~1.6–2.0 Mya. The haplotype block harbours 763 genes, including candidates regulating swim bladder pressure, haem synthesis and skeletal muscle organization conferring adaptation to long-distance migrations and vertical movements down to large depths. Our results suggest that the migratory ecotype experiences strong directional selection for the two adjacent inversions on LG1. Despite interbreeding between NEAC and NCC, the inversions are maintaining genetic differentiation, and we hypothesize the co-occurrence of multiple adaptive alleles forming a ‘supergene’ in the NEAC population. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","chromosomal inversion; gene flow; local adaptation; recombination; supergene; swim bladder","animal; Atlantic cod; chromosome inversion; DNA sequence; ecotype; gene linkage disequilibrium; genetic linkage; genetic selection; genetics; genotype; haplotype; Norway; population genetics; population migration; single nucleotide polymorphism; Animal Migration; Animals; Chromosome Inversion; Ecotype; Gadus morhua; Genetic Linkage; Genetics, Population; Genotype; Haplotypes; Linkage Disequilibrium; Norway; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Selection, Genetic; Sequence Analysis, DNA",Article,"",Scopus

Phenotypes that are positively associated with fitness were observed at temperatures closest to those experienced in the wild, consistent with the hypothesis that these populations are adapted to local thermal regimes. The lack of growth plasticity observed in Sambro cod might be due to costly maintenance of plasticity in stable environments or energy savings at cold temperatures.

Here, we applied restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-Seq) to test whether phenotypically differentiated populations of wild blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) breeding in a highly heterogeneous environment exhibit genetic structure related to habitat type. Using 12 106 SNPs in 197 individuals from deciduous and evergreen oak woodlands, we applied complementary population genomic analyses, which revealed that genetic variation is influenced by both geographical distance and habitat type. A fine-scale genetic differentiation supported by genome- and transcriptome-wide analyses was found within Corsica, between two adjacent habitats where blue tits exhibit marked differences in breeding time while nesting < 6 km apart. Using redundancy analysis (RDA), we show that genomic variation remains associated with habitat type when controlling for spatial and temporal effects. Finally, our results suggest that the observed patterns of genomic differentiation were not driven by a small proportion of highly differentiated loci, but rather emerged through a process such as habitat choice, which reduces gene flow between habitats across the entire genome.

Pioneering experiments emphasized the importance of aerobic scope in setting the functional thermal tolerance for activity in fishes. Variation in routine metabolism can have important performance and fitness consequences as it is related to dominance, aggression, boldness, territoriality, growth rate, postprandial oxygen consumption, life history, season, time of day, availability of shelter and social interactions. Wild fishes must perform many activities simultaneously (e.g. swim, obtain prey, avoid predators, compete, digest and reproduce) and oxygen delivery is allocated among competing organ systems according to the capacity of the heart to deliver blood. For example, salmonids that are simultaneously swimming and digesting trade-off maximum swimming performance in order to support the oxygen demands of digestion. As adult Pacific salmonids cease feeding in the ocean prior to their home migration, endogenous energy reserves and cardiac capacity are primarily partitioned among the demands for swimming upriver, sexual maturation and spawning behaviours. Furthermore, the upriver spawning migration is under strong selection pressure, given that Pacific salmonids are semelparous (single opportunity to spawn). Consequently, these fishes optimize energy expenditures in a number of ways: strong homing, precise migration timing, choosing forward-assist current paths and exploiting the boundary layer to avoid the strong currents in the middle of the river, using energetically efficient swimming speeds, and recovering rapidly from anaerobic swimming. Upon arrival at the spawning ground, remaining energy can be strategically allocated to the various spawning behaviours. Strong fidelity to natal streams has resulted in reproductively isolated populations that appear to be locally adapted physiologically to their specific environmental conditions. Populations with more challenging migrations have enhanced cardiorespiratory performance. Pacific salmonids are able to maintain aerobic scope across the broad range of temperatures encountered historically during their migration; however, climate change-induced river warming has created lethal conditions for many populations, raising conservation concerns. Despite considerable research examining cardiorespiratory physiology in Pacific salmonids over the last 70 years, critical knowledge gaps are identified. © 2016 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.","Aerobic scope; Energetics; Local adaptation; Migration; Oxygen consumption; Temperature","oxygen; animal; climate change; digestion; energy metabolism; heart; Oncorhynchus; oxygen consumption; physiology; population migration; reproduction; swimming; temperature; Animal Migration; Animals; Climate Change; Digestion; Energy Metabolism; Heart; Oncorhynchus; Oxygen; Oxygen Consumption; Reproduction; Swimming; Temperature",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus

One predicted consequence of flight loss is reduced dispersal ability, which should lead to population genetic differentiation and perhaps ultimately to speciation. Using a dataset of 15,123 SNP loci, we present comparative analyses of fine-scale population structure in codistributed Zelandoperla stonefly species, across three parallel altitudinal transects in New Zealand's Rock and Pillar mountain range. We find that winged populations (altitude 200-500 m; Zelandoperla decorata) show no genetic structuring within or among streams, suggesting substantial dispersal mediated by flight. By contrast, wingless populations (Zelandoperla fenestrata; altitude 200-1100 m) exhibit distinct genetic clusters associated with each stream, and additional evidence of isolation by distance within streams. Our data support the hypothesis that wing-loss can initiate diversification in alpine insect populations over small spatial scales. The often deep phylogenetic placement of lowland Z. fenestrata within their stream-specific clades suggests the possibility of independent alpine colonization events for each stream. Additionally, the detection of winged, interspecific hybrid individuals raises the intriguing possibility that a previously flightless lineage could reacquire flight via introgression. © 2016, Society for the Study of Evolution.","Adaptation; Alpine; Dispersal; Divergence; Flight loss; Genomics; Hybridization; Insect; Introgression; Speciation","alpine environment; altitude; comparative study; data set; dispersal; divergence; fecundity; flightlessness; genetic differentiation; genome; hybrid; hybridization; introgression; phylogenetics; population structure; recruitment (population dynamics); speciation (biology); stonefly; wing; New Zealand; Otago; Rock and Pillar Range; South Island; Fenestrida; Hexapoda; Plecoptera; Zelandoperla; animal; ecosystem; gene flow; genetics; growth, development and aging; insect; phylogeny; single nucleotide polymorphism; wing; Animals; Ecosystem; Gene Flow; Insects; Phylogeny; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Wings, Animal",Article,"",Scopus

However, few experiments have examined the drivers of differentiation among populations in asexual land plants with limited dispersal potential. Here, we evaluated the role of temperature in driving population differentiation in an asexual, obligate gametophyte fern species. METHODS: We reciprocally transplanted Vittaria appalachiana gametophytes among six populations that spanned the species’ geographic range in the Appalachian Mountains and Plateau. Temperature, survival, and senescence rates were measured for 1 year. KEY RESULTS: Populations had significantly different fitness responses to different sites, consistent with the hypothesis that populations have differentiated across the species’ range. There was some evidence for local adaptation in marginal populations and for countergradient selection favoring particularly robust genotypes at the northern range edge. Most populations had relatively high fitness at the site with the most stable temperature conditions and were negatively affected by decreasing minimum temperatures. CONCLUSIONS: Populations of Vittaria appalachiana exhibit highly variable responses to transplantation across the species’ range, and only a small subset of these responses are due to local adaptation. Differences in daily minimum temperature explain some variation in fitness, but other site-specific factors also have significant impacts on transplant fitness. These results indicate that asexual, patchily distributed species with limited dispersal may exhibit population-specific responses to global climate change that have not been elucidated by empirical work focused on sexually reproducing angiosperms. © 2016 Botanical Society of America.","Climate change; Countergradient selection; Gametophyte; Geographic range; Local adaptation; Population differentiation; Pteridaceae; Reciprocal transplant; Temperature variation; Vittaria appalachiana","angiosperm; climate change; dispersal; fern; fitness; gametophyte; gene flow; genetic differentiation; geographical variation; local adaptation; senescence; survival; temperature profile; transplantation; Appalachian Plateau; Appalachians; United States; Embryophyta; Filicophyta; Magnoliophyta; Pteridaceae; Vittaria appalachiana; adaptation; fern; flower; gene flow; genetics; Indiana; physiology; plant dispersal; United States; Adaptation, Biological; Appalachian Region; Ferns; Gene Flow; Germ Cells, Plant; Indiana; Plant Dispersal",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus

This is very useful, for example, in the field of conservation biology and evolutionary biology. Thanks to Next Generation Sequencing, genomic resources are growing exponentially, improving genome scan analyses in non-model species. Thousands of SNPs called using Reduced Representation Sequencing are increasingly used in genome scans. Besides, genome sequences are also becoming increasingly available, allowing better processing of short-read data, offering physical localization of variants, and improving haplotype reconstruction and data imputation. Ultimately, genome sequences are also becoming the raw material for selection inferences. Here, we discuss how the increasing availability of such genomic resources, notably genome sequences, influences the detection of signals of selection. Mainly, increasing data density and having the information of physical linkage data expand genome scans by (i) improving the overall quality of the data, (ii) helping the reconstruction of demographic history for the population studied to decrease false-positive rates and (III) improving the statistical power of methods to detect the signal of selection. Of particular importance, the availability of a high-quality reference genome can improve the detection of the signal of selection by (i) allowing matching the potential candidate loci to linked coding regions under selection, (ii) rapidly moving the investigation to the gene and function and (III) ensuring that the highly variable regions of the genomes that include functional genes are also investigated. For all those reasons, using reference genomes in genome scan analyses is highly recommended. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","conservation biology; landscape genetics; landscape genomics; local adaptation; natural population; population genomics","animal; DNA sequence; evolution; genetic selection; genetic variation; genomics; high throughput sequencing; population genetics; procedures; single nucleotide polymorphism; Animals; Biological Evolution; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Genomics; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Selection, Genetic; Sequence Analysis, DNA",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

The Ainu, a hunter–gatherer population of northern Japan and Sakhalin island of Russia, are thought to be key to elucidating the prehistory of Japan and the peopling of East Asia. Here, we study the genetic relationship of the Ainu with other East Asian and Siberian populations outside the Japanese archipelago using genome-wide genotyping data. We find that the Ainu represent a deep branch of East Asian diversity more basal than all present-day East Asian farmers. However, we did not find a genetic connection between the Ainu and populations of the Tibetan plateau, rejecting their long-held hypothetical connection based on Y chromosome data. Unlike all other East Asian populations investigated, the Ainu have a closer genetic relationship with northeast Siberians than with central Siberians, suggesting ancient connections among populations around the Sea of Okhotsk. We also detect a recent genetic contribution of the Ainu to nearby populations, but no evidence for reciprocal recent gene flow is observed.

Many organisms are facultative sexuals, with the ability to reproduce both sexually and asexually. Reduced sequencing costs means it is now possible to start investigating genome sequences of a wider number of these organisms in depth, but teasing apart the genetic forces underlying the maintenance of facultative sexual reproduction remains a challenge. An analogous problem exists when determining the genetic consequences of a degree of outcrossing (and recombination) in otherwise self-fertilizing organisms. Here, I provide an overview of existing research on the evolutionary basis behind different reproductive modes, with a focus on explaining the population genetic effects favouring low outcrossing rates in either partially selfing or asexual species. I review the outcomes that both self-fertilization and asexuality have on either purging deleterious mutations or fixing beneficial alleles, and what empirical data exist to support these theories. In particular, a greater application of mathematical models to genomic data has provided insight into the numerous effects that transitions to self-fertilization from outcrossing have on genetic architecture. Similar modelling approaches could be used to determine the forces shaping genetic diversity of facultative sexual species. Hence, a further unification of mathematical models with next-generation sequence data will prove important in exploring the genetic influences on reproductive system evolution. © 2016 European Society for Evolutionary Biology.","Adaptation; Asexuality; Genomics; Selfing; Sexual reproduction","adaptation; autogamy; evolutionary biology; genomics; outcrossing; population genetics; sexual reproduction; adaptation; animal; evolution; genetics; high throughput sequencing; inbreeding; mutation; parthenogenesis; phylogeny; plant; reproduction; self fertilization; Adaptation, Biological; Animals; Biological Evolution; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Inbreeding; Mutation; Parthenogenesis; Phylogeny; Plants; Reproduction; Self-Fertilization",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus

The first step to elucidate the potential for adaptation to unfavorable thermal conditions is to assess the degree of genotype-based variation in thermal reaction norms of vital fitness traits. Marine broadcast spawning fishes experience extremely high rates ofmortality during early life stages. Paternally derived (genetic) variation underlying offspring fitness in adverse environmental conditions may therefore hold important implications for resilience. This study examined how males differ in their ability to sire viable offspring and whether the paternal contribution modified thermal reaction norms for hatching success in two replicated trials with cod Gadus morhua from the Northwest Atlantic (trial 1) and Baltic Sea (trial 2). Each trial included five temperature treatments (2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0 °C in trial 1, and 6.5, 8.0, 9.5, 11.0, 12.5 °C in trial 2) encompassing optimum conditions as well as the amount of warming projected in various future pathways for the year 2100. In both trials, mean hatching success significantly decreased towards thermal extremes. However, half-sibling families varied in their response to different incubation temperatures as indicated by significant paternity × temperature interactions and crossing of reaction norms. The influence of paternity itself was highly significant and explained 56% and 44% of the observed variation in hatching success in trials 1 and 2, respectively. Early embryogenesis represented the most crucial developmental period in terms of thermal tolerance and paternally mediated variation in hatching success. High variation in daily embryo survival among half-sibling families and temperature treatments was observed during blastula and gastrulation stages (until 100% epiboly), while almost no mortality occurred during subsequent development and throughout the hatching period. The observed magnitude of genetic variation underlying thermal reaction norms for embryo viability represents a relevant resource for adaptive responses (favorable selection) of cod populations exposed to environmental variability and/or directional changes, such as ongoing ocean warming. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation; Atlantic cod; Gastrulation; Ocean warming; Paternal effects","adaptation; climate change; fitness; genetic variation; genotype-environment interaction; hatching; local extinction; parent-offspring interaction; paternity; perciform; reaction norm; reproductive success; sibling; spawning population; temperature tolerance; warming; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Northwest); Baltic Sea; Gadus morhua; Pisces",Article,"",Scopus

Uplift during the 1964 Great Alaska Earthquake abruptly created freshwater ponds on multiple islands in Prince William Sound and the Gulf of Alaska. In the short time since the earthquake, the phenotypes of resident freshwater threespine stickleback fish on at least three of these islands have changed dramatically from their oceanic ancestors. To test the hypothesis that these freshwater populations were derived from oceanic ancestors only 50 y ago, we generated over 130,000 singlenucleotide polymorphism genotypes from more than 1,000 individuals using restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq). Population genomic analyses of these data support the hypothesis of recent and repeated, independent colonization of freshwater habitats by oceanic ancestors. We find evidence of recurrent gene flow between oceanic and freshwater ecotypes where they co-occur. Our data implicate natural selection in phenotypic diversification and support the hypothesis that the metapopulation organization of this species helps maintain a large pool of genetic variation that can be redeployed rapidly when oceanic stickleback colonize freshwater environments. We find that the freshwater populations, despite population genetic analyses clearly supporting their young age, have diverged phenotypically from oceanic ancestors to nearly the same extent as populations that were likely founded thousands of years ago. Our results support the intriguing hypothesis that most stickleback evolution in fresh water occurs within the first few decades after invasion of a novel environment.","Adaptation; Contemporary evolution; Ecological divergence; Metapopulation; Population genomics","ancestry group; animal experiment; Article; DNA sequence; earthquake; ecotype; environmental recolonization; evolution; freshwater fish; gene flow; genetic analysis; genetic variability; genomics; genotype; habitat; hybridization; island (geological); metapopulation; natural selection; nonhuman; oceanic regions; phenotypic variation; population genetics; priority journal; restriction site; single nucleotide polymorphism; stickleback; Alaska; animal; classification; ecosystem; genetic variation; genetics; geography; island (geological); phenotype; phylogeny; physiology; sea; Smegmamorpha; fresh water; Alaska; Animals; Biological Evolution; Earthquakes; Ecosystem; Fresh Water; Gene Flow; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Genotype; Geography; Islands; Oceans and Seas; Phenotype; Phylogeny; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Smegmamorpha",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus

We test these models for a range-contracting seaweed using observations from a marine heatwave and a 12-month experiment, translocating seaweeds among central, present and historic range edge locations. Growth, reproductive development and survivorship display different temperature thresholds among central and rear-edge populations, but share a 2.5 °C anomaly threshold. Range contraction, therefore, reflects variation in local anomalies rather than differences in absolute temperatures.

Studies of highly mobile marine fish populations provide an opportunity to investigate this kind of heterogeneous genomic differentiation, but most studies to this effect have focused on a relatively low number of genetic markers and/or few populations. Hence, the patterns and extent of genomic divergence in high-gene-flow marine fish populations remain poorly understood. Results: We here investigated genome-wide patterns of genetic variability and differentiation in ten marine populations of three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) distributed across a steep salinity and temperature gradient in the Baltic Sea, by utilizing >30,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms obtained with a pooled RAD-seq approach. We found that genetic diversity and differentiation varied widely across the genome, and identified numerous fairly narrow genomic regions exhibiting signatures of both divergent and balancing selection. Evidence was uncovered for substantial genetic differentiation associated with both salinity and temperature gradients, and many candidate genes associated with local adaptation in the Baltic Sea were identified. Conclusions: The patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation, as well as candidate genes associated with adaptation, in Baltic Sea sticklebacks were similar to those observed in earlier comparisons between marine and freshwater populations, suggesting that similar processes may be driving adaptation to brackish and freshwater environments. Taken together, our results provide strong evidence for heterogenic genomic divergence driven by local adaptation in the face of gene flow along an environmental gradient in the post-glacially formed Baltic Sea. © 2015 Guo et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Baltic Sea; Gasterosteus aculeatus; local adaptation; RAD-sequencing; SNP, population differentiation","Gasterosteus aculeatus; Spinachia spinachia; adaptation; animal; DNA sequence; gene ontology; genetic association; genetic database; genetics; genome; geography; population genetics; restriction mapping; sea; single nucleotide polymorphism; Smegmamorpha; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Databases, Genetic; Gene Ontology; Genetic Association Studies; Genetics, Population; Genome; Geography; Oceans and Seas; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Restriction Mapping; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Smegmamorpha",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Results: Here the genome sequence of wild-born African cheetahs reveals extreme genomic depletion in SNV incidence, SNV density, SNVs of coding genes, MHC class I and II genes, and mitochondrial DNA SNVs. Cheetah genomes are on average 95 % homozygous compared to the genomes of the outbred domestic cat (24.08 % homozygous), Virunga Mountain Gorilla (78.12 %), inbred Abyssinian cat (62.63 %), Tasmanian devil, domestic dog and other mammalian species. Demographic estimators impute two ancestral population bottlenecks: one >100,000 years ago coincident with cheetah migrations out of the Americas and into Eurasia and Africa, and a second 11,084-12,589 years ago in Africa coincident with late Pleistocene large mammal extinctions. MHC class I gene loss and dramatic reduction in functional diversity of MHC genes would explain why cheetahs ablate skin graft rejection among unrelated individuals. Significant excess of non-synonymous mutations in AKAP4 (p<0.02), a gene mediating spermatozoon development, indicates cheetah fixation of five function-damaging amino acid variants distinct from AKAP4 homologues of other Felidae or mammals; AKAP4 dysfunction may cause the cheetah's extremely high (>80 %) pleiomorphic sperm.

In its interaction with selection, this is predicted to increase the genetic load, reduce inbreeding depression, and increase hybrid vigor, and in turn affect phenotypic evolution. Several of these predictions have been tested, but comprehensive studies controlling for confounding factors are scarce. Here, we show that populations of Daphnia magna, which vary strongly in genetic diversity, also differ in genetic load, inbreeding depression, and hybrid vigor in a way that strongly supports theoretical predictions. Inbreeding depression is positively correlated with genetic diversity (a proxy for Ne), and genetic load and hybrid vigor are negatively correlated with genetic diversity. These patterns remain significant after accounting for potential confounding factors and indicate that, in small populations, a large proportion of the segregation load is converted into fixed load. Overall, the results suggest that the nature of genetic variation for fitness-related traits differs strongly between large and small populations.

High genetic diversity at loci under selection in particular, indicated considerable adaptive potential, which may nevertheless be compromised by the combined effects of climate change and habitat fragmentation.",,"climate change; environmental cue; gene flow; genetic variation; geographical distribution; habitat fragmentation; natural selection; precipitation (climatology); shrub; Alnus; Frangula alnus; Hexapoda; Rhamnaceae; adaptation; animal; Bayes theorem; climate; DNA sequence; Europe; Frangula; genetic selection; genetic variation; genetics; genomics; genotype; geography; insect; plant genome; pollination; population genetics; single nucleotide polymorphism; tree; Adaptation, Biological; Animals; Bayes Theorem; Climate; Europe; Frangula; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Genome, Plant; Genomics; Genotype; Geography; Insects; Pollination; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Selection, Genetic; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Trees",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus

Though not readily apparent, constraints during one phase might influence the foraging strategies observed in another. For marine birds that fly and dive, body size constraints likely present a trade-off between foraging ability and migration as smaller bodies reduce flight costs, whereas larger bodies are advantageous for diving deeper. This study examines individual wintering strategies of deep diving thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia) breeding at three colonies in the south-eastern Bering Sea: St Paul, St George and Bogoslof. These colonies, arranged north to south, are located such that breeding birds forage in a gradient from shelf to deep-water habitats. We used geolocation time-depth recorders and stable isotopes from feathers to determine differences in foraging behaviour and diet of murres during three non-breeding periods, 2008-2011. Body size was quantified by a principal component analysis (wing, culmen, head+bill and tarsus length). A hierarchical cluster analysis identified winter foraging strategies based on individual movement, diving behaviour and diet (inferred from stable isotopes). Structural body size differed by breeding island. Larger birds from St Paul had higher wing loading than smaller birds from St George. Larger birds, mainly from St Paul, dove to deeper depths, spent more time in the Bering Sea, and likely consumed higher trophic-level prey in late winter. Three winter foraging strategies were identified. The main strategy, employed by small birds from all three breeding colonies in the first 2 years, was characterized by high residency areas in the North Pacific south of the Aleutians and nocturnal diving. In contrast, 31% of birds from St Paul remained in the Bering Sea and foraged mainly during the day, apparently feeding on higher trophic-level prey. Throat feather stable isotopes indicated that individuals exhibited flexibility in the use of this colony-specific foraging strategy. The third strategy only occurred in 2010/2011, when birds dove more and deeper, suggesting limited prey resources. Foraging strategies partitioned with respect to annual differences, presumably in response to shifts in distribution of prey, and were linked to body size. The presence of a colony-specific wintering strategy suggests the potential for overwinter survival differences between these populations. © 2015 British Ecological Society.","Bering Sea; Body size; Foraging strategies; Geolocation; Local adaptation; Marine habitats; Stable isotopes; Uria lomvia; Winter migration","body size; breeding population; diet; diving behavior; foraging behavior; local adaptation; marine ecosystem; migration; seabird; spatiotemporal analysis; stable isotope; trade-off; winter; Alaska; Aleutian Islands; Bering Sea; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); United States; Aves; Laridae; Uria lomvia; Alaska; animal; body size; Charadriiformes; diving; female; male; physiology; predation; season; Alaska; Animals; Body Size; Charadriiformes; Diving; Female; Male; Predatory Behavior; Seasons",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus

However, dispersal plasticity has been underappreciated in this literature. Plasticity in the decision to disperse is taxonomically widespread and I provide examples for insects, molluscs, polychaetes, vertebrates and flowering plants. Theoretical work is limited but indicates an interaction between dispersal distance and plasticity in the decision to disperse. When dispersal is confined to adjacent patches, dispersal plasticity may enhance local adaptation over unconditional (non-plastic) dispersal. However, when dispersal distances are greater, plasticity in dispersal decisions strongly reduces the potential for local adaptation and population divergence. Upon dispersal, settlement may be random, biased but genetically determined, or biased but plastically determined. Theory shows that biased settlement of either type increases population divergence over random settlement. One model suggests that plasticity further enhances chances of speciation. However, there are many strategies for deciding on where to settle such as a best-of-N strategy, sequential sampling with a threshold for acceptance or matching with natal habitat. To date, these strategies do not seem to have been compared within a single model. Although we are just beginning to explore evolutionary effects of dispersal plasticity, it clearly has the potential to enhance as well as inhibit population divergence.

Stocking can homogenize population structure, impede local adaptation, and hinder the use of genetic stock identification as a fishery management tool. Using 12 microsatellite loci, we evaluate the spatiotemporal genetic structure of 16 anadromous alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) populations in Maine, USA, to determine whether inter-basin stocking practices have influenced population structure and the genetic diversity of the species in this region. Although, no pre-supplementation samples exist, comparative analyses of stocked and non-stocked populations show that stock transfers have influenced alewife population genetic structure. Genetic isolation by distance (IBD) was non-significant among stocked populations, but significant among non-stocked populations. However, two populations, Dresden Mills and Sewell Pond, appear to have resisted genetic homogenization despite stocking. Non-significant genic and genetic differentiations were broadly distributed among alewife populations. Hierarchical AMOVA indicated highly significant differentiation among temporal replicates within populations, and Bayesian clustering analysis revealed weak population structure. A significant correlation was observed between stocking (time and events) and pairwise (Formula Presented.) among alewife collections, and an analysis of IBD residuals showed a significant decline in the amount of genetic differentiation among populations as the extent of stocking activity increased.

Species Distribution Models (SDMs) can help forecast such range shift responses. For few species, both correlative and mechanistic SDMs were built, but allis shad (Alosa alosa), an endangered anadromous fish species, is one of them. The main purpose of this study was to provide a framework for joint analyses of correlative and mechanistic SDMs projections in order to strengthen conservation measures for species of conservation concern. Guidelines for joint representation and subsequent interpretation of models outputs were defined and applied. The present joint analysis was based on the novel mechanistic model GR3D (Global Repositioning Dynamics of Diadromous fish Distribution) which was parameterized on allis shad and then used to predict its future distribution along the European Atlantic coast under different climate change scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). We then used a correlative SDM for this species to forecast its distribution across the same geographic area and under the same climate change scenarios. First, projections from correlative and mechanistic models provided congruent trends in probability of habitat suitability and population dynamics. This agreement was preferentially interpreted as referring to the species vulnerability to climate change. Climate change could not be accordingly listed as a major threat for allis shad. The congruence in predicted range limits between SDMs projections was the next point of interest. The difference, when noticed, required to deepen our understanding of the niche modelled by each approach. In this respect, the relative position of the northern range limit between the two methods strongly suggested here that a key biological process related to intraspecific variability was potentially lacking in the mechanistic SDM.

Dispersal is essential for locating mates, new resources, and to escape unfavourable conditions. Parasitism can impact a host's ability to perform energetically demanding activities such as long-distance flight, with important consequences for gene flow and meta-population dynamics. 2. Ectoparasites, in particular, can adversely affect host flight performance by diminishing flight aerodynamics and/or by inflicting physiological damage while feeding on host tissue. 3. Experimental flight assays were conducted using two fruit fly-mite systems: Drosophila nigrospiracula (Patterson and Wheeler) - Macrocheles subbadius (Berlese) and D. hydei (Sturtevan) - M. muscaedomesticae (Scopoli). Flies that are burdened by mites are expected to exhibit lower flight endurance compared to uninfected flies. 4. The results show that the presence of mites (attached) significantly decreased flight endurance by 57% and 78% compared to uninfected D. nigrospiracula and D. hydei, respectively. The physiological damage caused by M. subbadius was revealed through a 53% decline in flight time among previously infected flies (mites removed just prior to flight assay). Surprisingly, the presumably phoretic M. muscaedomesticae also caused a 62% reduction in flight endurance among previously infected D. hydei. 5. These results suggest a strong deleterious effect of ectoparasitic mites on host flight performance, mediated by a reduction in flight aerodynamics and damage to host physiology. Adverse effects on host flight and/or dispersal may have broad implications for gene flow, population genetic structure, and local adaptation in both host and parasite meta-populations. © 2015 The Royal Entomological Society.","Dispersal; Drosophila; Host-parasite interaction; Infection; Insect flight; Macrocheles; Parasitism","dispersal; ectoparasite; flight activity; fly; gene flow; genetic structure; host-parasite interaction; infectivity; local adaptation; metapopulation; mite; parasitism; physiological response; population dynamics; Acari; Drosophila hydei; Drosophila nigrospiracula; Hexapoda; Macrocheles; Macrocheles muscaedomesticae; Macrocheles subbadius",Article,"",Scopus

Despite extensive evidence of climate-driven advances in phenological events over recent decades, comparable patterns across species' geographic ranges have seldom been described. Even fewer studies have quantified concurrent spatial gradients and temporal trends between phenology and climate. Here we analyse a large data set (~129 000 phenology measures) over 37 years across the UK to provide the first phylogenetic comparative analysis of the relative roles of plasticity and local adaptation in generating spatial and temporal patterns in butterfly mean flight dates. Although populations of all species exhibit a plastic response to temperature, with adult emergence dates earlier in warmer years by an average of 6.4 days per °C, among-population differences are significantly lower on average, at 4.3 days per °C. Emergence dates of most species are more synchronised over their geographic range than is predicted by their relationship between mean flight date and temperature over time, suggesting local adaptation. Biological traits of species only weakly explained the variation in differences between space-temperature and time-temperature phenological responses, suggesting that multiple mechanisms may operate to maintain local adaptation. As niche models assume constant relationships between occurrence and environmental conditions across a species' entire range, an important implication of the temperature-mediated local adaptation detected here is that populations of insects are much more sensitive to future climate changes than current projections suggest. © 2015 The Authors.","Butterfly monitoring scheme; Climate change; Life history; Local adaptation; Phenology; Plasticity; Temperature; Traits","butterfly; climate change; climate effect; emergence; life history; local adaptation; phenology; phenotypic plasticity; temperature effect; temporal variation; United Kingdom; Hexapoda; adaptation; animal; butterfly; climate; climate change; phylogeny; physiology; population dynamics; season; temperature; United Kingdom; Adaptation, Biological; Animals; Butterflies; Climate; Climate Change; Phylogeny; Population Dynamics; Seasons; Temperature; United Kingdom",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

However, biotic and abiotic environmental variation can also induce plastic differences in immune function among populations. At present, there is little information concerning the relative magnitudes of heritable vs. induced immune divergence in natural populations. We examined immune gene expression profiles of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) from six lakes on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Parasite community composition differs between lake types (large or small, containing limnetic- or benthic-like stickleback) and between watersheds. We observed corresponding differences in immune gene expression profiles among wild-caught stickleback, using a set of seven immune genes representing distinct branches of the immune system. To evaluate the role of environmental effects on this differentiation, we experimentally transplanted wild-caught fish into cages in their native lake, or into a nearby foreign lake. Transplanted individuals' immune gene expression converged on patterns typical of their destination lake, deviating from their native expression profile. Transplant individuals' source population had a much smaller effect, suggesting relatively weak genetic underpinning of population differences in immunity, as viewed through gene expression. This strong environmental regulation of immune gene expression provides a counterpoint to the large emerging literature documenting microevolution and genetic diversification of immune function.

We use individual-based simulations to study the evolution and consequence of habitat preference during divergence with gene flow, considering four different underlying genetically based behavioural mechanisms: natal habitat imprinting, phenotype-dependent, competition-dependent and direct genetic habitat preference. We find that the evolution of habitat preference generally requires initially high dispersal, is facilitated by asymmetry in population sizes between habitats, and is hindered by an increasing number of underlying genetic loci. Moreover, the probability of habitat preference to emerge and promote divergence differs greatly among the underlying mechanisms. Natal habitat imprinting evolves most easily and can allow full divergence in parameter ranges where no divergence is possible in the absence of habitat preference. The reason is that imprinting represents a one-allele mechanism of assortative mating linking dispersal behaviour very effectively to local selection. At the other extreme, direct genetic habitat preference, a two-allele mechanism, evolves under restricted conditions only, and even then facilitates divergence weakly. Overall, our results indicate that habitat preference can be a strong reproductive barrier promoting divergence with gene flow, but that this is highly contingent on the underlying preference mechanism. © 2015 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.","Imprinting; Individual-based simulation; Local adaptation; Nonrandom dispersal; Parapatric speciation; Phenotypic plasticity","dispersal; divergence; gene flow; habitat selection; individual-based model; local adaptation; phenotypic plasticity; population size; speciation (biology); adaptation; animal dispersal; biological model; computer simulation; ecosystem; gene flow; genome imprinting; species differentiation; Adaptation, Biological; Animal Distribution; Computer Simulation; Ecosystem; Gene Flow; Genetic Speciation; Genomic Imprinting; Models, Biological; Models, Genetic",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus

Its development has been facilitated by next-generation sequencing, which allows for screening thousands to millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms in many individuals and populations at reasonable costs. In parallel, data sets describing environmental factors have greatly improved and increasingly become publicly accessible. Accordingly, numerous analytical methods for environmental association studies have been developed. Environmental association analysis identifies genetic variants associated with particular environmental factors and has the potential to uncover adaptive patterns that are not discovered by traditional tests for the detection of outlier loci based on population genetic differentiation. We review methods for conducting environmental association analysis including categorical tests, logistic regressions, matrix correlations, general linear models and mixed effects models. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches, provide a list of dedicated software packages and their specific properties, and stress the importance of incorporating neutral genetic structure in the analysis. We also touch on additional important aspects such as sampling design, environmental data preparation, pooled and reduced-representation sequencing, candidate-gene approaches, linearity of allele-environment associations and the combination of environmental association analyses with traditional outlier detection tests.

Indeed, it is often difficult to identify the molecular basis of adaptation to contrasted environments, and nongenetic effects increase the difficulty to disentangle fixed effects, such as genetic adaptation, from variable effects, such as individual phenotypic plasticity, in adaptation. Nevertheless, this question is also of great importance for understanding the evolution of species in a context of climate change. The red coral (Corallium rubrum) lives in the Mediterranean Sea, where at depths ranging from 5 to 600 m, it meets very contrasted thermal conditions. The shallowest populations of this species suffered from mortality events linked with thermal anomalies that have highlighted thermotolerance differences between individuals. We provide here a new transcriptomic resource, as well as candidate markers for the study of local adaptation. We sequenced the transcriptome of six individuals from 5 m and six individuals from 40 m depth at the same site of the Marseilles bay, after a period of common garden acclimatization. We found differential expression maintained between the two depths even after common garden acclimatization, and we analysed the polymorphism pattern of these samples. We highlighted contigs potentially implicated in the response to thermal stress, which could be good candidates for the study of thermal adaptation for the red coral. Some of these genes are also involved in the response to thermal stress in other corals.

Location: Subtropical coastal (Solitary Islands, Flinders Reef) and offshore (Lord Howe Island, Middleton Reef, Elizabeth Reef) eastern Australia and the southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Methods: Coral genetic diversity and identity were assessed by sequence analysis of a mitochondrial (mtDNA) region (ORF), a PCR-based mtDNA screening assay, and microsatellite loci. The identity of the Symbiodinium was determined using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of nuclear rDNA ITS2. Results: The mitochondrial haplotype Pocillopora damicornis Type α was present at all locations: 100% on the GBR and Flinders Reef, 85% and 87% respectively at Middleton Reef and Elizabeth Reef, 25% at Lord Howe Island and 5% at the Solitary Islands. An additional haplotype was observed at the Solitary Islands (corresponding to the recently described Pocillopora aliciae), and a third haplotype at the offshore high-latitude reefs (termed the Lord Howe Island haplotype).

The combination of historical records and genetic data can help to determine the origin of invasive / introduced species and allow the identification of the sources and dispersal process. We analyzed the genetic structure of Chinook salmon in the Futaleufú River (Pacific slope basin of Patagonia) using single nucleotide polymorphism genotypes and a recently described baseline dataset of native North American Chinook salmon populations. Our results revealed that Chinook salmon established in the Futaleufú River have high levels of within-population genetic diversity compared with populations from across the native range. Based on genetic similarity and historical reports, our results indicate that the Futaleufú population was first established by colonizing fish derived from the Lower Columbia River Basin, imported into Chile for ocean ranching purposes during the 1970s and 1980s, and afterward it was strongly supplemented by escaped fish from net pen aquaculture that used broodstock imported during the 1990s from various sources, including the California Central Valley (via New Zealand), the Middle Oregon Coast, and Vancouver Island. The higher incidence of fish derived from the most recent introductions in our sample suggest that the contribution of escaped salmon from these posterior stockings on establishment success must have been particularly strong because included different sources. Subsequent admixture and hybridization among these multiple independent source stocks is likely responsible for the high level of standing genetic variation, which may be facilitating local adaptation and augmenting the opportunity for successful invasion and further colonization. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Chinook salmon; Pacific slope basin of Patagonia; Potential origin","aquaculture; colonization; gene flow; genetic structure; hybridization; invasiveness; local adaptation; population genetics; ranching; river basin; salmonid fishery; Pacific Ocean; Patagonia; Oncorhynchus; Oncorhynchus tshawytscha",Article,"",Scopus

We acclimated fish to constant swimming (emulating limnetic foraging) and control conditions (emulating normal activity levels) to simultaneously study phenotypic plasticity. We found extensive divergence between ecotypes: dwarf fish generally had constitutively higher values of traits related to oxygen transport (ventricle size) and use by skeletal muscle (percent oxidative muscle, mitochondrial content), and also evolved differential plasticity of mitochondrial function (Complex I activity and flux through Complexes I-IV and IV). The effects of swim training were less pronounced than differences among ecotypes and the traits which had a significant training effect (ventricle protein content, ventricle malate dehydrogenase activity, and muscle Complex V activity) did not differ among ecotypes. Only one trait, ventricle mass, varied in a similar manner with acclimation and adaptation and followed a pattern consistent with genetic accommodation.

While freshwater fishes have provided a compelling example of the link between the environment and phenotypic diversity, few studies have been conducted with arid-zone fishes, particularly those that occur in geographically isolated regions where species typically inhabit intermittent and ephemeral creeks. We investigated morphological variation of a freshwater fish (the western rainbowfish, Melanotaenia australis) inhabiting creeks in the Pilbara region of northwest Australia to determine whether body shape variation correlated with local environmental characteristics, including water velocity, habitat complexity, predator presence, and food availability. We expected that the geographic isolation of creeks within this arid region would result in habitat-specific morphological specializations. We used landmark-based geometric morphometrics to quantify the level of morphological variability in fish captured from 14 locations within three distinct subcatchments of a major river system. Western rainbowfish exhibited a range of morphologies, with variation in body depth accounting for a significant proportion (>42%) of the total variance in shape. Sexual dimorphism was also apparent, with males displaying deeper bodies than females. While the measured local habitat characteristics explained little of the observed morphological variation, fish displayed significant morphological differentiation at the level of the subcatchment. Local adaptation may partly explain the geographic patterns of body shape variation, but fine-scale genetic studies are required to disentangle the effects of genetic differentiation from environmentally determined phenotypic plasticity in body shape. Developing a better understanding of environment-phenotype relationships in species from arid regions will provide important insights into ecological and evolutionary processes in these unique and understudied habitats. © 2015 The Authors.

Wild Norwegian (East Atlantic) salmon stocks are thought to be especially susceptible to the parasite due to lack of co-adaptation, contrary to Baltic salmon stocks. This study i) identifies whether time-and density-dependent mechanisms in gyrodactylid population growth exist in G. salaris-Atlantic salmon interactions and ii) based on differences between Norwegian and Baltic stocks, determines whether the 'Atlantic susceptible, Baltic resistant' paradigm holds as an example of local adaptation. Methods: A total of 18 datasets of G. salaris population growth on individually isolated Atlantic salmon (12 different stocks) infected with three parasite strains were re-analysed using a Bayesian approach. Datasets included over 2000 observations of 388 individual fish. Results: The best fitting model of population growth was time-limited; parasite population growth rate declined consistently from the beginning of infection. We found no evidence of exponential population growth in any dataset. In some stocks, a density dependence in the size of the initial inoculum limited the maximum rate of parasite population growth. There is no evidence to support the hypothesis that all Norwegian and Scottish Atlantic salmon stocks are equally susceptible to G. salaris, while Baltic stocks control and limit infections due to co-evolution. Northern and Western Norwegian as well as the Scottish Shin stocks, support higher initial parasite population growth rates than Baltic, South-eastern Norwegian, or the Scottish Conon stocks, and several Norwegian stocks tested (Akerselva, Altaelva, Lierelva, Numedalslågen), and the Scottish stocks (i.e. Conon, Shin), were able to limit infections after 40-50 days. No significant differences in performance of the three parasite strains (Batnfjordselva, Figga, and Lierelva), or the two parasite mitochondrial haplotypes (A and F) were observed. Conclusions: Our study shows a spectrum of growth rates, with some fish of the South-eastern Norwegian stocks sustaining parasite population growth rates overlapping those seen on Baltic Neva and Indalsälv stocks. This observation is inconsistent with the 'Baltic-resistant, Atlantic-susceptible' hypothesis, but suggests heterogeneity, perhaps linked to other host resistance genes driven by selection for local disease syndromes. © 2015 Ramírez et al.","Density-dependence; Host-parasite dynamics; Local adaptation; Time-dependence; Transmission biology","Article; Atlantic salmon; Baltic States; controlled study; fish stock; growth rate; gyrodactylosis; Gyrodactylus salaris; haplotype; host parasite interaction; natural selection; nonhuman; Norway; parasite load; population density; population growth; population regulation; United Kingdom; animal; Bayes theorem; fish disease; growth, development and aging; parasitology; physiology; reproduction; Salmo salar; trematode; trematodiasis; veterinary; Gyrodactylidae; Gyrodactylus salaris; Salmo salar; Animals; Bayes Theorem; Fish Diseases; Host-Parasite Interactions; Reproduction; Salmo salar; Trematoda; Trematode Infections",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

In this paper, we analyze people’s perceptions of environmental and climate-related transformations in communities across the Western Solomon Islands through ethnographic and geospatial methods. Specifically, we documented people’s observed changes over the past decades across various environmental domains, and for each change, we asked respondents to identify the causes, timing, and people’s adaptive responses. We also incorporated this information into a geographical information system database to produce broad-scale base maps of local perceptions of environmental change. Results suggest that people detected changes that tended to be acute (e.g., water clarity, logging intensity, and agricultural diseases). We inferred from these results that most local observations of and adaptations to change were related to parts of environment/ecosystem that are most directly or indirectly related to harvesting strategies. On the other hand, people were less aware of slower insidious/chronic changes identified by scientific studies.

However, given the functional importance of the proteins encoded by the mitochondrial genome, and the prominent role of mitochondria in cellular energy production, the assumption of neutrality is increasingly being questioned. Results: We tested for evidence of selection on the mitochondrial genome of the Atlantic salmon, which is a locally adapted and widely farmed species and is distributed across a large latitudinal cline. We analysed 20 independent regions of the salmon mtDNA that represented nine genes (ND1, ND2, ND3, COX1, COX2, ATP6, ND4, ND5, and CYTB). These 20 mtDNA regions were sequenced using a 454 approach from samples collected across the entire European range of this species. We found evidence of positive selection at the ND1, ND3 and ND4 genes, which is supported by at least two different codon-based methods and also by differences in the chemical properties of the amino acids involved. The geographical distribution of some of the mutations indicated to be under selection was not random, and some mutations were private to artic populations. We discuss the possibility that selection acting on the Atlantic salmon mtDNA genome might be related to the need for increased metabolic efficiency at low temperatures. Conclusions: The analysis of sequences representing nine mitochondrial genes that are involved in the OXPHOS pathway revealed signatures of positive selection in the mitochondrial genome of the Atlantic salmon. The properties of the amino acids involved suggest that some of the mutations that were identified to be under positive selection might have functional implications, possibly in relation to metabolic efficiency. Experimental evidence, and better understanding of regional phylogeographic structuring, are needed to clarify the potential role of selection acting on the mitochondrial genome of Atlantic salmon and other locally adapted fishes. © 2015 Consuegra et al.",,"adaptation; gene; genetic marker; genome; local adaptation; low temperature; metabolism; mitochondrial DNA; mutation; natural selection; phylogeography; population genetics; population structure; protein; salmonid; Atlantic Ocean; Europe; Pisces; Salmo salar; fish protein; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase; animal; DNA sequence; domestic animal; genetic selection; genetics; metabolism; mitochondrial genome; mitochondrion; molecular evolution; phylogeny; Salmo salar; Animals; Animals, Domestic; Evolution, Molecular; Fish Proteins; Genome, Mitochondrial; Mitochondria; NADH Dehydrogenase; Phylogeny; Salmo salar; Selection, Genetic; Sequence Analysis, DNA",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

The toxic cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa (poor food) significantly depressed the r values, compared with a nutritious green alga (good food). The tolerance index to cyanobacteria (rpoor/rgood) of 24 clones from six populations differed significantly among clones and populations. Twelve of 15 pairs of two populations had significant divergence with the shortest geographic distance of 2.2 km. Compared with these clones from six populations, 25 clones from another population had a comparable tolerance index. The amount of genetic variation available to selection pressure was sufficient within a population. The tolerance index increased and exhibited saturation with increasing microcystin concentrations in sediments, a proxy of the prevalence of cyanobacterial blooms. The divergence in tolerance between populations was more significantly correlated with the difference in microcystin concentrations than the geographic distance between two sites.

Here we use an individual-based model to investigate the utility of genome-wide selection components analysis, which compares allele frequencies of individuals at different life history stages within a single population to detect selection without requiring a priori knowledge of traits under selection. We modeled a diploid, sexually reproducing population and introduced strong mate choice on a quantitative trait to simulate sexual selection. Genome-wide allele frequencies in adults and offspring were compared using weighted FST values. The average number of outlier peaks (i.e., those with significantly large FST values) with a quantitative trait locus in close proximity (""real"" peaks) represented correct diagnoses of loci under selection, whereas peaks above the FST significance threshold without a quantitative trait locus reflected spurious peaks. We found that, even with moderate sample sizes, signatures of strong sexual selection were detectable, but larger sample sizes improved detection rates. The model was better able to detect selection with more neutral markers, and when quantitative trait loci and neutral markers were distributed across multiple chromosomes. Although environmental variation decreased detection rates, the identification of real peaks nevertheless remained feasible. We also found that detection rates can be improved by sampling multiple populations experiencing similar selection regimes. In short, genome-wide selection components analysis is a challenging but feasible approach for the identification of regions of the genome under selection. © 2015 The Authors.","Adaptation; Population genetics; Population genomics; RAD-seq; Reproductive success; Simulation model",,Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

For the majority of significant differences in gene expression levels, phenotypic plasticity and adaptation operate on different suites of genes. The subset of genes that demonstrate both adaptive differences and phenotypic plasticity, however, exhibit countergradient variation of expression. Thus, expression differences among populations counteract environmental effects, reducing the phenotypic differentiation between populations.

In Pocillopora corals, nine recently identified genetic lineages disagree fundamentally with the 17 recognized Pocillopora species, including 5 major Indo-Pacific reef-builders. Pocillopora corals hybridize in the Tropical Eastern Pacific, so it is possible that some of the disagreement between the genetics and taxonomy may be due to introgressive hybridization. Here we used 6769 genome-wide SNPs from Restriction-site Associated DNA Sequencing (RAD-Seq) to conduct phylogenomic comparisons among three common, Indo-Pacific Pocillopora species - P. damicornis, P. eydouxi and P. elegans - within and between populations in the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP) and the Central Pacific. Genome-wide RAD-Seq comparisons of Central and TEP Pocillopora confirm that the morphospecies P. damicornis, P. eydouxi and P. elegans are not monophyletic, but instead fall into three distinct genetic groups. However, hybrid samples shared fixed alleles with their respective parental species and, even without strict monophyly, P. damicornis share a common set of 33 species-specific alleles across the Pacific. RAD-Seq data confirm the pattern of one-way introgressive hybridization among TEP Pocillopora, suggesting that introgression may play a role in generating shared, polyphyletic lineages among currently recognized Pocillopora species.

In-depth genome-wide analyses suggest that Amblyrhynchus diverged from its sister group, the Galaápagos land iguanas, around 4.5 million years ago (Ma), but divergence among extant populations is exceedingly young (less than 50 000 years). Despite Amblyrhynchus appearing as a single long-branch species phylogenetically, we find strong population structure between islands, and one case of incipient speciation of sister lineageswithin the same island—ostensibly initiated by volcanic events. Hybridization between both lineages is exceedingly rare, yet frequent hybridization with migrants from nearby islands is evident. The contemporary snapshot provided by highly variable markers indicates that speciation events may have occurred throughout the evolutionary history of marine iguanas, though these events are not visible in the deeper phylogenetic trees. We hypothesize that the observed interplay of speciation and hybridization might be a mechanism by which local adaptations, generated by incipient speciation, can be absorbed into a common gene pool, thereby enhancing the evolutionary potential of the species as a whole. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

The use of behavioural responses of resident populations as bioindicator of shoreline stability has been tested under various conditions, including after soft and hard engineering actions to stabilise eroded beaches. Port structures likely have impact on sediment longshore transportation and shoreline stability. The question was whether talitrid orientation behaviour could be proposed as bioindicator of impacts also for sandy bays of limited extension and highly used for recreation, such as those in the vicinity of touristic port structures. Orientation experiments were carried out on a set of sandy beaches of different extension and morphology, each of them in the vicinity of a touristic port, across the Mediterranean coasts. The protocol included field orientation tests of populations of talitrids, then analysed in terms of orientation precision seawards (considering sun compass orientation as the most locally adapted behavioural mechanism) in different seasons (before and after the touristic season) and times of day. The populations from more protected (either naturally or artificially) headland-bays showed a higher precision of orientation with respect to the shoreline direction than those from extended beaches, more subject to changes in longshore sedimentary transport as consequence of natural and human activities. The distance from the port and touristic pressure had no influence on talitrid orientation. An important stabilising factor for the sandy beach ecosystems, including talitrid populations and their behavioural adaptation, appeared to be the presence of seagrass banquette. The behavioural data point out that biotic information proceeding from local animal populations linked to beach sediments may complement sedimentology data and allow scaling the impacts occurring on a developed coastline. This becomes particularly relevant when considering interdisciplinary approaches to monitoring strategies. © 2015 The Authors","Beach ecosystem; Behavioural adaptation; Bioindicators; Orientation; Sandy beaches; Talitrids","Banks (bodies of water); Beaches; Biomarkers; Coastal zones; Crystal orientation; Ecology; Ecosystems; Fenders (port structures); Population statistics; Port structures; Sedimentology; Stability; Animal populations; Behavioural adaptation; Environmental stability; Field orientation; Mediterranean coasts; Monitoring strategy; Sandy beach; Talitrids; Behavioral research; amphipod; bioindicator; habitat fragmentation; local adaptation; orientation behavior; protected area; resident population; seagrass; sediment transport; shoreline; tourist behavior; Mediterranean Sea; Animalia; Talitridae",Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus

We investigated the genomic signatures of local adaptation in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.) along a natural salinity gradient, ranging from 35% in the North Sea to 7% within the Baltic Sea. By utilizing a 12K SNP chip, we simultaneously assessed neutral and adaptive genetic divergence across the Atlantic cod genome. Combining outlier analyses with a landscape genomic approach, we identified a set of directionally selected loci that are strongly correlated with habitat differences in salinity, oxygen, and temperature. Our results show that discrete regions within the Atlantic cod genome are subject to directional selection and associated with adaptation to the local environmental conditions in the Baltic- and the North Sea, indicating divergence hitchhiking and the presence of genomic islands of divergence. We report a suite of outlier single nucleotide polymorphisms within or closely located to genes associated with osmoregulation, as well as genes known to play important roles in the hydration and development of oocytes. These genes are likely to have key functions within a general osmoregulatory framework and are important for the survival of eggs and larvae, contributing to the buildup of reproductive isolation between the low-salinity adapted Baltic cod and the adjacent cod populations. Hence, our data suggest that adaptive responses to the environmental conditions in the Baltic Sea may contribute to a strong and effective reproductive barrier, and that Baltic cod can be viewed as an example of ongoing speciation. © The Author(s) 2015.","Atlantic cod; Baltic Sea; Ecological divergence; Genomic adaptation; Population genomics; SNPs; Speciation","adaptation; animal; Atlantic cod; gene; gene linkage disequilibrium; genetic selection; genetics; genome; genomics; salinity; single nucleotide polymorphism; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Gadus morhua; Genes; Genome; Genomics; Linkage Disequilibrium; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Salinity; Selection, Genetic",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

We exploited the North Sea-Baltic Sea transition for investigating the seascape genetics of a marine diatom, Skeletonema marinoi. Eight polymorphic microsatellite loci were analysed in 354 individuals from ten locations to analyse population structure of the species along a 1500-km-long salinity gradient ranging from 3 to 30 psu. To test for salinity adaptation, salinity reaction norms were determined for sets of strains originating from three different salinity regimes of the gradient. Modelled oceanographic connectivity was compared to directional relative migration by correlation analyses to examine oceanographic drivers. Population genetic analyses showed distinct genetic divergence of a low-salinity Baltic Sea population and a high-salinity North Sea population, coinciding with the most evident physical dispersal barrier in the area, the Danish Straits. Baltic Sea populations displayed reduced genetic diversity compared to North Sea populations. Growth optima of low salinity isolates were significantly lower than those of strains from higher native salinities, indicating local salinity adaptation. Although the North Sea-Baltic Sea transition was identified as a barrier to gene flow, migration between Baltic Sea and North Sea populations occurred. However, the presence of differentiated neutral markers on each side of the transition zone suggests that migrants are maladapted. It is concluded that local salinity adaptation, supported by oceanographic connectivity patterns creating an asymmetric migration pattern between the Baltic Sea and the North Sea, determines genetic differentiation patterns in the transition zone. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","local adaptation; marine phytoplankton; oceanographic connectivity; population genetics","Nitzschia alba; Skeletonema marinoi; microsatellite DNA; adaptation; diatom; DNA sequence; gene flow; genetic variability; genetics; genotype; molecular genetics; North Sea; oceanography; population genetics; salinity; Adaptation, Physiological; Diatoms; Gene Flow; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Genotype; Microsatellite Repeats; Molecular Sequence Data; North Sea; Oceanography; Salinity; Sequence Analysis, DNA",Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus

Many host populations for parasites are partly migratory, consisting of both migratory and resident individuals, and we asked the question whether these two subpopulations differ in parasite susceptibility. If so, barriers intercepting migration may change the parasite encystment rate and recruitment. We used the River Ljungan, Sweden, as study system, where eight hydroelectric power plants hinder access of sea-migrating trout to most tributaries. We compared the encystment of the threatened freshwater pearl mussel (. Margaritifera margaritifera) larvae on sympatric tributary-resident brown trout and sea-migrating trout (. Salmo trutta) as hosts for their parasitic larvae. We also compared eighteen tributary-resident brown trout populations with the sea-migrating trout as hosts for mussel larvae. Encystment decreased faster over time on the tributary-resident trout than on the sea-migrating trout. Encystment was therefore higher on the sea-migrating trout compared to the tributary-resident trout at the time of excystment of the larvae. Growth of encysted mussel larvae was higher on the sea-migrating trout than on the tributary-resident trout. The natural density of the tributary-resident trout populations was lower than that of the sea-migrating trout in the autumn, when the mussels infest the fish, and in early summer, just before the excystment of juvenile mussels from the fish. Estimations of total numbers of encysted mussel larvae per unit stream area were higher on the sea-migrating trout than the tributary-resident trout in the autumn and in the spring at the time of juvenile mussel excystment. The higher mussel larval growth and the higher encystment on the sea-migrating trout imply that even seemingly healthy tributary mussel populations are reduced because of the habitat fragmentation. As sea-migrating trout are threatened or extinct in many rivers, fragmentation may be a large-scale problem, not only for sea-migrating populations, but also indirectly for highly threatened mussel populations. Restoration activities should primarily focus on creating free pathways for original host fish populations instead of sustaining them by supplementary stocking. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Habitat fragmentation; Host parasite; Hydroelectric power plants; Local adaptation; Margaritifera; Salmo trutta; Unionoid mussels","bivalve; encystment; endangered species; habitat fragmentation; host-parasite interaction; local adaptation; migratory behavior; perciform; population decline; population structure; recruitment (population dynamics); sympatry; Margaritifera; Margaritifera margaritifera; Salmo trutta; Salmonidae; Unionoida",Article,"",Scopus

To elucidate the role of different evolutionary processes shaping the variation in gill raker number of European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus sensu lato) in the Baltic Sea basin, we assessed the relationships between genetic and phenotypic variation among and within three whitefish ecotypes (sea spawners, river spawners and lake spawners). To generate expected neutral distribution of FST and to evaluate whether highly variable microsatellite loci resulted in deflated FST estimates compared to less variable markers, we performed population genetic simulations under finite island and hierarchical island models. The genetic divergence observed among (FCT = 0.010) and within (FST = 0.014-0.041) ecotypes was rather low. The divergence in gill raker number, however, was substantially higher between sea and river spawners compared to observed microsatellite data and simulated neutral baseline (PCT &gt; FCT). This suggests that the differences in gill raker number between sea and river spawners are likely driven by divergent natural selection. We also found strong support for divergent selection on gill raker number among different populations of sea spawners (PST &gt; FST), most likely caused by highly variable habitat use and diverse diet. The putative role of divergent selection within lake spawners initially inferred from empirical microsatellite data was not supported by simulated FST distributions. This work provides a first formal test of divergent selection on gill raker number in Baltic whitefish, and demonstrates the usefulness of population genetic simulations to generate informative neutral baselines for PST-FST analyses helping to disentangle the effects of stochastic evolutionary processes from natural selection. © 2015 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.","Baltic sea; Divergent selection; European whitefish; FST; Gill raker number; Microsatellites; PST; Population genetic simulation; QST","baseline conditions; bone; divergence; ecotype; evolutionary biology; genetic marker; genetic variation; local adaptation; natural selection; phenotypic plasticity; spawning population; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; Coregonus lavaretus; microsatellite DNA; adaptation; animal; Baltic States; fish; genetic variation; genetics; genotype; gill; physiology; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Baltic States; Fishes; Genetic Variation; Genotype; Gills; Microsatellite Repeats",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus

Although some ecological traits common to invasive species have been identified, little is known about the possible genomic/genetic mechanisms that may underlie their success. A common scenario in many introductions is that small founder population sizes will often lead to reduced genetic diversity, but that invading populations experience large environmental perturbations, such as changes in habitat and environmental stress. Although sudden and intense stress is usually considered in a negative context, these perturbations may actually facilitate rapid adaptation by affecting genome structure, organization and function via interactions with transposable elements (TEs), especially in populations with low genetic diversity. Stress-induced changes in TE activity can alter gene action and can promote structural variation that may facilitate the rapid adaptation observed in new environments. We focus here on the adaptive potential of TEs in relation to invasive species and highlight their role as powerful mutational forces that can rapidly create genetic diversity. We hypothesize that activity of transposable elements can explain rapid adaptation despite low genetic variation (the genetic paradox of invasive species), and provide a framework under which this hypothesis can be tested using recently developed and emerging genomic technologies. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","evolutionary genetics; genomics; introduced species; loci of adaptation; mobile elements; naturalized species; nonfunctional DNA","transposon; adaptation; chromosome map; evolution; genetic association; genetic variability; genetics; introduced species; population genetics; quantitative trait locus; transposon; Adaptation, Biological; Biological Evolution; Chromosome Mapping; DNA Transposable Elements; Genetic Association Studies; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Introduced Species; Quantitative Trait Loci",Article,"",Scopus

Here, we provide a comprehensive genomic study of Isla del Coco (Costa Rica) feral pigs, a unique population that was allegedly founded by two individuals and has remained isolated since 1793. Using SNP arrays and genome sequencing, we show that Cocos pigs are hybrids between Asian and European pigs, as are modern international pig breeds. This conclusively shows that, as early as the 18th century, British vessels were loading crossbred pigs in Great Britain and transporting them overseas. We find that the Y chromosome has Asian origin, which has not been reported in any international pig breed. Chinese haplotypes seem to have been transmitted independently between Cocos and other pig breeds, suggesting independent introgression events and a complex pattern of admixing. Although data are compatible with a founder population of N = 2, variability levels are as high in Cocos pigs as in international pig breeds (∼1.9 SNPs/kb) and higher than in European wild boars or local breeds (∼1.7 SNPs/kb). Nevertheless, we also report a 10-Mb region with a marked decrease in variability across all samples that contains four genes (CPE, H3F3C, SC4MOL and KHL2) previously identified as highly differentiated between wild and domestic pigs.

Due to their short generation time and large reproductive output, parasites are commonly believed to be ahead in this race, although increasing evidence exists that parasites are not always ahead in the arms race - in part owing to evolutionary lineage and recent ecological history. We assess local adaptation of hosts and parasites, and determine whether adaptation was influenced by ecological or evolutionary history, using full reciprocal cross-infections of four Gyrodactylus ectoparasite populations and their four guppy (. Poecilia reticulata) host populations in Trinidad. To consider effects of evolutionary lineage and recent ecology, these four populations were collected from two different river drainages (Marianne and Aripo) and two different predation environments (high and low). The highest infection levels were obtained when parasites from the Aripo lineage infected guppies from the Marianne lineage, indicating a higher infectivity, virulence and/or reproductive success of the Aripo parasites. Aripo lineage guppies were also better able to limit Gyrodactylus population growth than guppies from the Marianne River, indicating their strong ""resistance"" to Gyrodactylus regardless of the source of the parasite. Predation environment had no detectable influence on host-parasite population dynamics of sympatric or allopatric combinations. The much stronger effect of evolutionary lineage (i.e., river) than recent ecological history (i.e., predation) emphasises its importance in driving co-evolutionary dynamics, and should be explored further in future studies on local host-parasite adaptation. © 2015 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.","Ecological history; Evolutionary lineage; Gyrodactylus; Host-parasite coevolution; Local adaptation; Poecilia reticulata","arms race; coevolution; ectoparasite; fish; host-parasite interaction; infectivity; local adaptation; population dynamics; reproductive success; virulence; adaptation; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; embryo; fish disease; guppy; gyrodactylosis; Gyrodactylus; host parasite interaction; infection rate; male; nonhuman; parasite virulence; predation; adaptation; animal; ecosystem; Ectoparasitic Infestations; evolution; Fish Diseases; genetic predisposition; parasitology; Poecilia; river; Trinidad and Tobago; veterinary; Aripo River; Trinidad and Tobago; Trinidad [Trinidad and Tobago]; Gyrodactylus; Poecilia reticulata; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Biological Evolution; Ecosystem; Ectoparasitic Infestations; Fish Diseases; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Poecilia; Rivers; Trinidad and Tobago",Article,"",Scopus

The integration of population size estimates and demographic dynamics as well as individual behaviour (embracing aspects like dispersal behaviour) allows for testing of adaptations to local environments and understanding time-lags frequently observed in molecular data.

Historical accounts indicate this species occurred naturally in two adjacent river systems in Australia, the Burnett and Mary. Current day populations in other rivers are thought to have arisen by translocation fromthese source populations. Early genetic work detected very little variation and so had limited power to answer questions relevant for management including how genetic variation is partitioned within and among sub-populations. In this study, we use newly developed microsatellitemarkers to examine samples from the Burnett and Mary Rivers, as well as from two populations thought to be of translocated origin, Brisbane and North Pine.We test whether there is significant genetic structure among and within river drainages; assign putatively translocated populations to potential source populations; and estimate effective population sizes. Eleven polymorphic microsatellite loci genotyped in 218 individuals gave an average within-population heterozygosity of 0.39 which is low relative to other threatened taxa and for freshwater fishes in general. Based on FST values (average over loci = 0.11) and STRUCTURE analyses, we identify three distinct populations in the natural range, one in the Burnett and two distinct populations in the Mary. These analyses also support the hypothesis that the Mary River is the likely source of translocated populations in the Brisbane and North Pine rivers, which agrees with historical published records of a translocation event giving rise to these populations.

We subjected four populations of Chara vulgaris to a common garden experiment. Each population came from locations at different altitudes, hence living at different mean temperatures. Individual charophyte cultures were initiated with specimens from four origins and acclimatized at 20°C in a controlled environment for 3 weeks. After this, all the populations were incubated under 3 water temperature treatments: 20°C (control), 22°C and 24°C. A two-way ANOVA (temperature. ×. population origin) showed that the temperature treatment significantly, and positively, affected the growth calculated on normalized dry weight, the length of the main axis, the number of branches per node, the horizontal biomass distribution and the respiration rate. Moreover, a significant effect of the temperature. ×. population-origin interaction was detected for biomass production, total length and branch production.

Nevertheless, the importance of these marginal populations as putative reservoirs of adaptive genetic variation has scarcely been considered in conservation biology. This is particularly true in marine ecosystems for which the deep refugia hypothesis proposes that disturbed shallow and marginal populations of a given species can be replenished by mesophotic ones. This hypothesis therefore assumes that identical PEIs exist between populations, neglecting the potential for adaptation at species range margins. Here, we combine reciprocal transplant and common garden experiments with population genetics analyses to decipher the PEIs in the red coral, Corallium rubrum. Our analyses reveal partially contrasting PEIs between shallow and mesophotic populations separated by approximately one hundred meters, suggesting that red coral populations may potentially be locally adapted to their environment. Based on the effective population size and connectivity analyses, we posit that genetic drift may be more important than gene flow in the adaptation of the red coral. We further investigate how adaptive divergence could impact population viability in the context of warming and demonstrate differential phenotypic buffering capacities against thermal stress.

However, a stock's potential to contribute to rebuilding hinges on demographic connectivity, a challenging parameter to measure. With genomics as a new tool, fisheries managers can detect signatures of natural selection and thus identify fishing areas likely to contribute evolutionarily compatible colonizers to an overfished area (i.e. colonizers that are not at a fitness disadvantage in the overfished area and able to reproduce at optimal rates). Identifying evolutionarily compatible stocks would help narrow the focus on establishing demographic connectivity where it matters. Here, we genotype 4723 SNPs in 616 orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) across five fishing areas off the Tasmanian coast in Australia. We ask whether these areas form a single genetic unit, and test for signatures of local adaptation. Results from amova, structure, discriminant analysis of principal components, bayesass and isolation by distance suggest that sampled locations are subjected to geneflow amounts that are above what is needed to establish 'drift connectivity'. However, it remains unclear whether there is a single panmictic population or several highly connected populations. Most importantly, we did not find any evidence of local adaptation, suggesting that the examined orange roughy stocks are evolutionarily compatible. The data have helped test an assumption of the orange roughy management programme and to formulate hypotheses regarding stock demographic connectivity. Overall, our results demonstrate the potential of genomics to inform fisheries management, even when evidence for stock structure is sparse. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","conservation; deep-sea; fisheries management; orange roughy; population genomics","Hoplostethus atlanticus; adaptation; animal; Australia; Bayes theorem; biological model; discriminant analysis; environmental protection; evolution; fish; fishery; gene flow; genetics; genotype; metagenomics; population dynamics; population genetics; principal component analysis; single nucleotide polymorphism; Adaptation, Biological; Animals; Australia; Bayes Theorem; Biological Evolution; Conservation of Natural Resources; Discriminant Analysis; Fisheries; Fishes; Gene Flow; Genetics, Population; Genotype; Metagenomics; Models, Genetic; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Population Dynamics; Principal Component Analysis",Article,"",Scopus

Snails from two southern (heat tolerant) and two northern (heat sensitive) populations were acclimated to a common thermal environment, exposed to an environmentally relevant thermal stress and analysed using RNA-seq. Pooling across all populations revealed 306 genes with differential expression between control and heat-stressed samples, including 163 significantly upregulated and 143 significantly downregulated genes. When considered separately, regional differences in response were widely apparent. Heat shock proteins (Hsps) were upregulated in both regions, but the magnitude of response was significantly greater in northern populations for most Hsp70s, while the southern populations showed greater upregulation for approximately half of the Hsp40s. Of 177 stress-responsive genes in northern populations, 55 responded to heat stress only in northern populations. Several molecular chaperones and antioxidant genes that were not differentially expressed in southern populations showed higher expression under control conditions compared with northern populations. This suggests that evolution of elevated expression of these genes under benign conditions preadapts the southern populations to frequent heat stress and contributes to their higher thermal tolerance. These results indicate that evolution has resulted in different transcriptome responses across populations, including upregulation of genes in response to stress and preadaptation of genes in anticipation of stress (based on evolutionary history of frequent heat exposure). The relative importance of the two mechanisms differs among gene families and among populations. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","ecological genomics; local adaptation; mollusc; RNA-seq; rocky intertidal; thermal tolerance","Chlorostoma; Gastropoda; Mollusca; heat shock protein; RNA; transcriptome; adaptation; animal; chromosome map; gene expression; genetics; heat shock response; physiology; population genetics; sequence analysis; snail; United States; upregulation; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; California; Chromosome Mapping; Gene Expression; Genetics, Population; Heat-Shock Proteins; Heat-Shock Response; RNA; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Snails; Transcriptome; Up-Regulation",Article,"",Scopus

Traditional explanations for limited local adaptation focus on maladaptive gene flow or homogeneous environmental conditions. These classical explanations have, however, failed to explain variation in the magnitude of local adaptation observed across taxa. Here we show that variable levels of local adaptation are better explained by trait dimensionality. First, we develop and analyse mathematical models that predict levels of local adaptation will increasewith the number of traits experiencing spatially variable selection. Next, we test this prediction by estimating the relationship between dimensionality and local adaptation using data from 35 published reciprocal transplant studies. This analysis reveals a strong correlation between dimensionality and degree of local adaptation, and thus provides empirical support for the predictions of our model. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.","Ecological differentiation; Ecological genetics; Gene flow; Reciprocal transplant; Species range; Transplant experiment","environmental conditions; gene flow; life history trait; local adaptation; numerical model; reciprocity; adaptation; animal; biological model; gene flow; genetic variation; genetics; human; phenotype; population dynamics; population genetics; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Gene Flow; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Humans; Models, Genetic; Phenotype; Population Dynamics",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus

One such group of salmonids is steelhead O. mykiss (anadromous Rainbow Trout) from the Willamette River, a tributary of the Columbia River. Within the Willamette River there are multiple steelhead life history and run-timing types, some of which originated from nonnative populations. Late winter-run steelhead and Rainbow Trout are native to the Willamette River, whereas early winter-run and summer-run steelhead have been introduced into the system via releases from artificial propagation efforts. We conducted genetic analyses of Willamette River steelhead to determine the effect that nonnative steelhead released into the Willamette River basin have had on the genetic population structure of native steelhead. We found genetic differentiation among the samples that separated steelhead into four population groups that corresponded to run type. Possibly due to local adaptation, the native run type has retained its genetic distinctiveness from the introduced types, despite there being opportunities for gene flow among all types. Introduced early winter-run steelhead appear to be the origin of steelhead inhabiting certain Willamette River tributaries where native steelhead did not historically spawn. © 2015, © American Fisheries Society 2015.",,"gene flow; genetic analysis; genetic differentiation; genetic structure; genotype; introduced species; life history; local adaptation; native species; population decline; salmonid; Columbia River; Oregon; United States; Willamette River; Oncorhynchus; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Salmonidae",Article,"",Scopus

This contribution investigates the use of juvenile freshwater pearl mussels as bioindicators, considering the influence of mussel stock and study stream conditions on juvenile performance, as described by survival and growth rates. A standardized cross experiment was carried out investigating juvenile performance in four different pearl mussel stocks originating from the Rhine, Danube and Elbe drainages, representing distinct genetic conservation units. The juveniles were exposed in five study streams which were selected to integrate pearl mussel streams with different water qualities and recruitment status of the mussel population. Per study stream, five standard mesh cages containing an equal number of 20 (10 × 2) juvenile pearl mussels per stock in separate chambers were installed. Survival and growth rates of juveniles were checked after three months (i.e. before their first winter) and after nine months (i.e. after their first winter). Mussel stock and study stream conditions significantly influenced juvenile performance. Growth rates were determined by study stream conditions and increased with stream water temperature, organic carbon and C/N ratios. Survival rates varied stock-specifically, indicating different levels of local adaptation to their native streams. Due to the detection of stream-specific differences in juvenile performance, freshwater pearl mussels appear suitable as bioindicators. However, a careful consideration of stock-specificity is necessary to avoid false interpretation of bioindication results. The comparison of stock-specific survival in native versus non-native streams implicates that exposure of juveniles outside their native habitats is able to increase breeding success or else serve for risk spreading in breeding programs. © 2014 Elsevier GmbH.","Endangered species; Fitness; Freshwater mussel conservation; Local adaptation; Population differentiation","differentiation; environmental conditions; freshwater ecosystem; growth rate; juvenile; local adaptation; survival; Danube River; Elbe River; Rhine River; Bivalvia; Margaritifera margaritifera",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus

Such migrations are major drivers of ecosystem processes and strongly influence the survival and fecundity of individuals. For migratory animals, a formidable challenge is to find their way over long distances and through complex, dynamic environments. However, recent theoretical and empirical work suggests that by traveling in groups, individuals are able to overcome these challenges and increase their ability to navigate. Here we use models to explore the implications of collective navigation on migratory, and population, dynamics, for both breeding migrations (to-and-fro migrations between distinct, fixed, end-points) and feeding migrations (loop migrations that track favorable conditions). Results: We show that while collective navigation does improve a population's ability to migrate accurately, it can lead to Allee effects, causing the sudden collapse of populations if numbers fall below a critical threshold. In some scenarios, hysteresis prevents the migration from recovering even after the cause of the collapse has been removed. In collectively navigating populations that are locally adapted to specific breeding sites, a slight increase in mortality can cause a collapse of genetic population structure, rather than population size, making it more difficult to detect and prevent. Conclusions: Despite the large interest in collective behavior and its ubiquity in many migratory species, there is a notable lack of studies considering the implications of social navigation on the ecological dynamics of migratory species. Here we highlight the potential for a previously overlooked Allee effect in socially migrating species that may be important for conservation and management of such species. © 2016 The Author(s).","Anadromous fish; Collective navigation; Dispersal; Local adaptation; Migration; Migratory birds; Migratory marine fish; Migratory ungulates; Population collapse",,Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Because they often show intra-specific genetic and phenotypic variation, which can result from drift or differential selective pressures between habitats, understanding the distribution of such variation and its underlying processes is a prerequisite to develop effective management guidelines. Indeed, translocations among genetically differentiated populations potentially locally adapted are discouraged in order to avoid outbreeding depression, while translocations among populations characterized by high gene flow with no evidence for local adaptation are encouraged. Here, we first test whether 2 recognized subspecies, the North Island kaka (Nestor meridionalis septentrionalis) and South Island kaka (Nestor meridionalis meridionalis) of New Zealand fit a scenario of allopatric subspeciation following the separation of the North and South Islands at the end of the Pleistocene using 1 mtDNA (n = 96) and 9 microsatellite markers (n = 126). We then test whether morphological differences among the 2 subspecies support a pattern of local adaptation, comparing phenotypic divergence (PST) and the level of divergence by drift alone (FST) among populations. We find little population structure between islands, ruling out allopatric subspeciation in kaka. Further, PST exceeds FST, supporting an adaptive latitudinal size cline consistent with Bergmann's rule. These results therefore suggest that using neutral genetic diversity alone can be misleading when identifying management units and that the nature of phenotypic variation should be considered in translocations efforts. We finally discuss North and South Island management units but suggest that cross-island translocation be allowed. © 2015 The American Genetic Association.

Processes such as genetic drift, local reduction of gene flow around genes causing reproductive isolation, hitchhiking around selected variants, variation in recombination and mutation rates are all factors that can contribute to the heterogeneity of genomic divergence. On the basis of 60 fully sequenced three-spined stickleback genomes, we explore these different mechanisms explaining the heterogeneity of genomic divergence across five parapatric lake and river population pairs varying in their degree of genetic differentiation. We find that divergent regions of the genome are mostly specific for each population pair, while their size and abundance are not correlated with the extent of genome-wide population differentiation. In each pair-wise comparison, an analysis of allele frequency spectra reveals that 25–55% of the divergent regions are consistent with a local restriction of gene flow. Another large proportion of divergent regions (38–75%) appears to be mainly shaped by hitchhiking effects around positively selected variants. We provide empirical evidence that alternative mechanisms determining the evolution of genomic patterns of divergence are not mutually exclusive, but rather act in concert to shape the genome during population differentiation, a first necessary step towards ecological speciation. © 2015 Feulner et al.",,"animal tissue; Article; controlled study; copy number variation; gene flow; gene frequency; gene linkage disequilibrium; gene sequence; genetic heterogeneity; genetic variability; genotype; local adaptation; nonhuman; population abundance; population differentiation; population dispersion; population size; single nucleotide polymorphism; species diversity; stickleback; animal; ecology; genetic selection; genetic variation; genetics; genomics; lake; molecular evolution; population genetics; reproductive isolation; Smegmamorpha; species differentiation; Gasterosteus aculeatus; Animals; Ecology; Evolution, Molecular; Gene Flow; Gene Frequency; Genetic Speciation; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Genomics; Lakes; Reproductive Isolation; Selection, Genetic; Smegmamorpha",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Ecologically mediated selection contributes to genetic divergence both in the presence or absence of geographic isolation between populations, and is considered an important driver of speciation. Indeed, the genetics of ecological speciation is becoming increasingly studied across a variety of taxa and environments. In this paper we review the literature of ecological speciation in the tropics. We report on low research productivity in tropical ecosystems and discuss reasons accounting for the rarity of studies. We argue for research programs that simultaneously address biogeographical and taxonomic questions in the tropics, while effectively assessing relationships between reproductive isolation and ecological divergence. To contribute toward this goal, we propose a new framework for ecological speciation that integrates information from phylogenetics, phylogeography, population genomics, and simulations in evolutionary landscape genetics (ELG). We introduce components of the framework, describe ELG simulations (a largely unexplored approach in ecological speciation), and discuss design and experimental feasibility within the context of tropical research. We then use published genetic datasets from populations of five codistributed Amazonian fish species to assess the performance of the framework in studies of tropical speciation. We suggest that these approaches can assist in distinguishing the relative contribution of natural selection from biogeographic history in the origin of biodiversity, even in complex ecosystems such as Amazonia. We also discuss on how to assess ecological speciation using ELG simulations that include selection. These integrative frameworks have considerable potential to enhance conservation management in biodiversity rich ecosystems and to complement historical biogeographic and evolutionary studies of tropical biotas. © 2015 Beheregaray, Cooke, Chao and Landguth.","Adaptive divergence; Biodiversity conservation; Biogeography; Ecological genomics; Evolutionary landscape genetics; Phylogenetics; Phylogeography; Tropical diversification","mitochondrial DNA; sea water; ecological genetics; evolutionary adaptation; evolutionary landscape genetics; genealogy; genetic selection; genetic trait; genetic variability; genotype; geographic distribution; natural selection; phylogeny; phylogeography; population genetics; Review; simulation; species differentiation; tropic climate; water sampling",Review,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

However, knowledge remains limited about how such effects vary across populations. Here, we investigated whether incubation temperature (26, 28, and 30°C) differentially affects the embryonic development of Asian yellow pond turtle (Mauremys mutica) eggs originating from low-latitude (Guangzhou, 23°06'N) and high-latitude (Haining, 30°19'N) populations in China. At 26°C, the duration of incubation was shorter in the high-latitude population than in the low-latitude population. However, this pattern was reversed at 30°C. As the incubation temperature increased, hatching success increased in the low-latitude population but slightly decreased in the high-latitude population. Hatchlings incubated at 30°C were larger and righted themselves more rapidly than those incubated at 26°C in the low-latitude population. In contrast, hatchling traits were not influenced by incubation temperature in the high-latitude population. Overall, 30°C was a suitable developmental temperature for embryos from the low-latitude population, whereas 26 and 28°C were suitable for those from the high-latitude population. This interpopulation difference in suitable developmental temperatures is consistent with the difference in the thermal environment of the two localities. Therefore, similarly to posthatching individuals, reptile embryos from different populations might have evolved diverse physiological strategies to benefit from the thermal environment in which they develop. © 2014 The Linnean Society of London.","Embryonic response; Geographical variation; Hatchling size; Incubation temperature; Local adaptation","embryonic development; hatching; incubation; interpopulation variation; latitude; phenotypic plasticity; population genetics; temperature effect; turtle; Asia; Mauremys mutica; Reptilia",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus

The distinctive morphological and physiological features of penguins allow them to live an aquatic life, and some of them have successfully adapted to the hostile environments in Antarctica. To study the phylogenetic and population history of penguins and the molecular basis of their adaptations to Antarctica, we sequenced the genomes of the two Antarctic dwelling penguin species, the Adélie penguin [Pygoscelis adeliae] and emperor penguin [Aptenodytes forsteri].Results: Phylogenetic dating suggests that early penguins arose ~60 million years ago, coinciding with a period of global warming. Analysis of effective population sizes reveals that the two penguin species experienced population expansions from ~1 million years ago to ~100 thousand years ago, but responded differently to the climatic cooling of the last glacial period. Comparative genomic analyses with other available avian genomes identified molecular changes in genes related to epidermal structure, phototransduction, lipid metabolism, and forelimb morphology.Conclusions: Our sequencing and initial analyses of the first two penguin genomes provide insights into the timing of penguin origin, fluctuations in effective population sizes of the two penguin species over the past 10 million years, and the potential associations between these biological patterns and global climate change.

Using 14 microsatellite loci, we first characterized amphidromous and freshwater groups of Cottus asper in a high gene flow setting in the Lower Fraser River system (south-western British Columbia, Canada) to test for the effects of habitat and geographical distance on the distribution of life-history ecotypes. Within the main river channel, no genetic differentiation was found, whereas tributaries even close to the estuary were genetically differentiated. Partial mantel tests confirmed that genetic differentiation between river tributaries and the main channel was independent from geographical distance, with distance-scaled migration rates indicating reduced gene flow from the main channel into the tributaries. Our results suggest that isolation-by-environment can play an important role for the early stage of life-history transitions, and may promote differentiation among life-history ecotypes despite the presence of gene flow. © 2014 The Linnean Society of London.","Amphidromy; Isolation-by-ecology; Local adaptation; Population genetics","fish; gene flow; genetic structure; habitat type; life history; local adaptation; population structure; taxonomy; British Columbia; Canada; Fraser River; Cottus asper",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus

As a consequence, some human-mediated fish transfers have unintentionally yielded novel research opportunities to study how phenotypes and genes interact with their environment and affect ecological and evolutionary change. The primary purpose here is to explore how work, directly or indirectly involved with human-mediated transfers, has unintentionally yielded novel research and research opportunities in fish ecology and evolution.

Effective conservation actions require the delineation of conservation units to appropriately reflect the spatial scale of intraspecific variation and local adaptation. Towards this goal, we used the most comprehensive genetic and genomic database for Atlantic salmon to date, covering the entire North American range of the species. The database included microsatellite data from 9142 individuals from 149 sampling locations and data from a medium-density SNP array providing genotypes for >3000 SNPs for 50 sampling locations. We used neutral and putatively selected loci to integrate adaptive information in the definition of conservation units. Bayesian clustering with the microsatellite data set and with neutral SNPs identified regional groupings largely consistent with previously published regional assessments. The use of outlier SNPs did not result in major differences in the regional groupings, suggesting that neutral markers can reflect the geographic scale of local adaptation despite not being under selection. We also performed assignment tests to compare power obtained from microsatellites, neutral SNPs and outlier SNPs. Using SNP data substantially improved power compared to microsatellites, and an assignment success of 97% to the population of origin and of 100% to the region of origin was achieved when all SNP loci were used. Using outlier SNPs only resulted in minor improvements to assignment success to the population of origin but improved regional assignment. We discuss the implications of these new genetic resources for the conservation and management of Atlantic salmon in North America. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","assignment tests; fishery; hierarchical population structure; local adaptation; microsatellites; single nucleotide polymorphisms; SNP array","Salmo salar; microsatellite DNA; animal; Atlantic salmon; Bayes theorem; cluster analysis; DNA sequence; environmental protection; genetic database; genetics; genomics; genotype; North America; population genetics; single nucleotide polymorphism; Animals; Bayes Theorem; Cluster Analysis; Conservation of Natural Resources; Databases, Genetic; Genetics, Population; Genomics; Genotype; Microsatellite Repeats; North America; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Salmo salar; Sequence Analysis, DNA",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

The killer whale (Orcinus orca) has a worldwide distribution, and individual social groups travel over a wide geographic range. Even so, regional populations have been shown to be genetically differentiated, including among different foraging specialists (ecotypes) in sympatry. Given the strong matrifocal social structure of this species together with strong resource specializations, understanding the process of differentiation will require an understanding of the relative importance of both genetic drift and local adaptation. Here we provide a high-resolution analysis based on nuclear single-nucleotide polymorphic markers and inference about differentiation at both neutral loci and those potentially under selection. We find that all population comparisons, within or among foraging ecotypes, show significant differentiation, including populations in parapatry and sympatry. Loci putatively under selection show a different pattern of structure compared to neutral loci and are associated with gene ontology terms reflecting physiologically relevant functions (e.g. related to digestion). The pattern of differentiation for one ecotype in the North Pacific suggests local adaptation and shows some fixed differences among sympatric ecotypes. We suggest that differential habitat use and resource specializations have promoted sufficient isolation to allow differential evolution at neutral and functional loci, but that the process is recent and dependent on both selection and drift. © 2014 The Authors.

While some individuals possess the ability to undertake an anadromous marine migration, others remain resident in freshwater throughout their life cycle. Those that will migrate undergo tremendous physiological, morphological, and behavioral transformations in a process called smoltification which transitions freshwater-adapted parr to marine-adapted smolts. While the behavior, ecology, and physiology of smoltification are well described, our understanding of the proximate genetic mechanisms that trigger the process are not well known. Quantitative genetic analyses have identified several genomic regions associated with smoltification and migration-related traits within this species. Here we investigate the divergence in gene expression of 18 functional and positional candidate genes for the smoltification process in the brain, gill, and liver tissues of migratory smolts, resident parr, and precocious mature male trout at the developmental stage of out-migration.

Marine fishes are valuable organisms for advancing our understanding of evolution on historical and contemporary time scales, and here we highlight areas in which research on these species is likely to be particularly important in the near future. These include possibilities for gaining insights into processes on ecological time scales, identifying genomic signatures associated with population divergence under gene flow, and determining the genetic basis of phenotypic traits. We also consider future challenges pertaining to the implementation of genome-wide coverage through next-generation sequencing and genotyping methods in marine fishes. Complications associated with fast decay of linkage disequilibrium, as expected for species with large effective population sizes, and the possibility that adaptation is associated with both soft selective sweeps and polygenic selection, leaving complex genomic signatures in natural populations, are likely to challenge future studies. However, the combination of high genome coverage and new statistical developments offers promising solutions. Thus, the next generation of studies is likely to truly facilitate the transition from population genetics to population genomics in marine fishes.

Natural plant populations have an extremely poor displacing capacity, so their continued survival in a given environment depends on how well they adapt to local pedoclimatic conditions. Genomic tools can be used to identify adaptive traits at a DNA level and to further our understanding of evolutionary processes. Here we report the use of genotyping-by-sequencing on local groups of the sequenced monocot model species Brachypodium distachyon. Exploiting population genetics, landscape genomics and genome wide association studies, we evaluate B. distachyon role as a natural probe for identifying genomic loci involved in environmental adaptation.Results: Brachypodium distachyon individuals were sampled in nine locations with different ecologies and characterized with 16,697 SNPs. Variations in sequencing depth showed consistent patterns at 8,072 genomic bins, which were significantly enriched in transposable elements. We investigated the structuration and diversity of this collection, and exploited climatic data to identify loci with adaptive significance through i) two different approaches for genome wide association analyses considering climatic variation, ii) an outlier loci approach, and iii) a canonical correlation analysis on differentially sequenced bins. A linkage disequilibrium-corrected Bonferroni method was applied to filter associations. The two association methods jointly identified a set of 15 genes significantly related to environmental adaptation. The outlier loci approach revealed that 5.7% of the loci analysed were under selection. The canonical correlation analysis showed that the distribution of some differentially sequenced regions was associated to environmental variation.Conclusions: We show that the multi-faceted approach used here targeted different components of B. distachyon adaptive variation, and may lead to the discovery of genes related to environmental adaptation in natural populations. Its application to a model species with a fully sequenced genome is a modular strategy that enables the stratification of biological material and thus improves our knowledge of the functional loci determining adaptation in near-crop species. When coupled with population genetics and measures of genomic structuration, methods coming from genome wide association studies may lead to the exploitation of model species as natural probes to identify loci related to environmental adaptation. © 2014 Dell'Acqua et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Adaptation; Association mapping; Brachypodium distachyon; Genotyping by sequencing; GWAS; Landscape genomics; Population genetics","Article; Brachypodium; controlled study; environmental factor; evolutionary adaptation; gene locus; genetic association; genetic variability; genotype environment interaction; genotyping technique; natural selection; nonhuman; plant genetics; population genetics; sequence analysis; single nucleotide polymorphism; transposon; adaptation; Brachypodium; environment; genetics; genomics; genotyping technique; phylogeny; physiology; plant gene; sequence analysis; Brachypodium distachyon; Adaptation, Physiological; Brachypodium; Environment; Genes, Plant; Genetic Loci; Genomics; Genotyping Techniques; Phylogeny; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Sequence Analysis",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Genome scans allow the identification of the genetic basis of local adaptation without previous knowledge of genetic variation or traits under selection. Candidate loci for divergent adaptation are expected to show higher FST than neutral loci influenced solely by random genetic drift, migration and mutation. The comparison of spatial patterns of neutral markers and loci under selection may help disentangle the effects of gene flow, genetic drift and selection among populations living in contrasting environments. Using the gastropod Radix balthica as a system, we analyzed 376 AFLP markers and 25 mtDNA COI haplotypes for candidate loci and associations with local adaptation among contrasting thermal environments in Lake Mývatn, a volcanic lake in northern Iceland. We found that 2% of the analysed AFLP markers were under directional selection and 12% of the mitochondrial haplotypes correlated with differing thermal habitats. The genetic networks were concordant for AFLP markers and mitochondrial haplotypes, depicting distinct topologies at neutral and candidate loci. Neutral topologies were characterized by intense gene flow revealed by dense nets with edges connecting contrasting thermal habitats, whereas the connections at candidate loci were mostly restricted to populations within each thermal habitat and the number of edges decreased with temperature.

Although cardiac collapse starts at 21-23 C with a maximum heart rate of ∼\n150 beats per min (bpm) for 12 C-acclimated fish, acclimation to 20 C considerably raises this temperature (27.5 C) and maximum heart rate (∼\n200 bpm). Only minor population differences exist and these are consistent with the warmer habitat of the southern population. We demonstrate that the considerable cardiac plasticity discovered for Atlantic salmon is largely independent of natural habitat, and we propose that observed cardiac plasticity may aid salmon to cope with global warming. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

As such, the development of long term local adaptation is impossible. However, both plasticity and spatially varying selection have been invoked in explaining how American eel may cope with an unusual broad scope of environmental conditions. Here, we address this question through transcriptomic analyses and genomic reaction norms of eels from two geographic origins reared in controlled environments.Results: The null hypothesis of no difference in gene expression between eels from the two origins was rejected. Many unique transcripts and two out of seven gene clusters showed significant difference in expression, both at time of capture and after three months of common rearing. Differences in expression were observed at numerous genes representing many functional groups when comparing eels from a same origin reared under different salinity conditions. Plastic response to different rearing conditions varied among gene clusters with three clusters showing significant origin-environment interactions translating into differential genomic norms of reaction. Most genes and functional categories showing differences between origins were previously shown to be differentially expressed in a study comparing transcription profiles between adult European eels acclimated to different salinities.Conclusions: These results emphasize that while plasticity in expression may be important, there is also a role for local genetic (and/or epigenetic) differences in explaining differences in gene expression between eels from different geographic origins. Such differences match those reported in genetically distinct populations in other fishes, both in terms of the proportion of genes that are differentially expressed and the diversity of biological functions involved. We thus propose that genetic differences between glass eels of different origins caused by spatially varying selection due to local environmental conditions translates into transcriptomic differences (including different genomic norms of reaction) which may in turn explain part of the phenotypic variance observed between different habitats colonized by eels. © 2014 Côté et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Anguilla; Conservation; Gene-environment interactions; Genomic reaction norm; Microarrays; Panmixia; Plasticity; Trancriptome","Anguilla (fish); Anguilla rostrata; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; biodiversity; controlled study; demography; environmental factor; female; gene cluster; gene expression; genetic difference; genetic selection; genetic transcription; genetic variability; genotype environment interaction; habitat; local adaptation; male; nonhuman; phenotypic plasticity; phenotypic variation; population genetics; rearing; salinity; transcriptomics; adaptation; Anguilla; animal; biology; cluster analysis; environment; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; genomics; genotype environment interaction; molecular genetics; multigene family; Adaptation, Biological; Anguilla; Animals; Cluster Analysis; Computational Biology; Environment; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene-Environment Interaction; Genomics; Male; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Multigene Family; Selection, Genetic",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

For species that form climatic ecotypes, if future climate exceeds local population tolerance, climate change will precipitate the decline of extant populations range-wide. Here, we examine the variation in physiological and morphological traits of Eriophorum vaginatum L. collected from a 30-year-old reciprocal transplant experiment, in which six populations of E. vaginatum were transplanted along a latitudinal gradient from Eagle Creek to Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. We tested for ecotypic differentiation of photosynthesis, respiration, chlorophyll fluorescence, and biomass per tiller, which is a metric correlated with population growth in E. vaginatum. The light-saturated photosynthetic rate (Amax) showed homesite advantage in that tussocks in their homesites had significantly higher values of Amax relative to nonlocal populations. This pattern of homesite advantage was also observed for biomass per tiller, but not for fluorescence and respiration. Photosynthetic rate was positively correlated with biomass per tiller and survival, suggesting that adaptations related to photosynthesis may optimize performance of local populations to homesite conditions. Taken together, these findings indicate that a rapidly changing climate may elicit population decline of E. vaginatum, rendering this species at a competitive disadvantage to shrubs and boreal forest species, which are expanding northward as the climate changes.

Current advances in genome technologies provide new opportunities for obtaining a genome-scale view of the action of parasite-driven natural selection in wild populations and thus facilitate the search for specific genomic regions underlying inter-population differences in pathogen response. European populations of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) exhibit natural variance in susceptibility levels to the ectoparasite Gyrodactylus salaris Malmberg 1957, ranging from resistance to extreme susceptibility, and are therefore a good model for studying the evolution of virulence and resistance. However, distinguishing the molecular signatures of genetic drift and environment-associated selection in small populations such as land-locked Atlantic salmon populations presents a challenge, specifically in the search for pathogen-driven selection. We used a novel genome-scan analysis approach that enabled us to i) identify signals of selection in salmon populations affected by varying levels of genetic drift and ii) separate potentially selected loci into the categories of pathogen (G. salaris)-driven selection and selection acting upon other environmental characteristics. A total of 4631 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were screened in Atlantic salmon from 12 different northern European populations. We identified three genomic regions potentially affected by parasite-driven selection, as well as three regions presumably affected by salinity-driven directional selection. Functional annotation of candidate SNPs is consistent with the role of the detected genomic regions in immune defence and, implicitly, in osmoregulation. These results provide new insights into the genetic basis of pathogen susceptibility in Atlantic salmon and will enable future searches for the specific genes involved. © 2014 Zueva et al.",,"animal tissue; article; Atlantic salmon; controlled study; directional selection; evolutionary adaptation; female; gene locus; genetic drift; genetic variability; genome; Gyrodactylus salaris; host susceptibility; immunity; nonhuman; osmoregulation; promoter region; single nucleotide polymorphism; animal; Europe; evolution; gene ontology; genetic selection; genetics; genomics; geography; molecular genetics; parasite; parasitology; physiology; population dynamics; population genetics; Salmo salar; wild animal; Animals; Animals, Wild; Biological Evolution; Europe; Gene Ontology; Genetics, Population; Genome; Genomics; Geography; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Parasites; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Population Dynamics; Salmo salar; Selection, Genetic",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

The eastern Baltic population has been very weakly studied in comparison with the western population.The aim of this study is to demonstrate for the first time genetic differentiation by the use of a large number of SNPs between eastern and western Baltic populations existing in differentiated salinity conditions. Two cod samples were collected from the Bay of Gdańsk, Poland and one from the Kiel Bight, Germany. Samples were genotyped using a cod derived SNP-array (Illumina) with 10 913 SNPs.

Results indicated a clear distinctness of the Kiel Bight from the populations of the eastern Baltic. FST comparison between both eastern samples was non-significant.

Several populations of this species have successfully adapted to environments contaminated with toxic aromatic hydrocarbon pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Previous studies suggest that the mechanism of resistance to these and other ""dioxin-like compounds"" (DLCs) may involve reduced signaling through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) pathway. Here we investigated gene diversity and evidence for positive selection at three AHR-related loci (AHR1, AHR2, AHRR) in F. heteroclitus by comparing alleles from seven locations ranging over 600 km along the northeastern US, including extremely polluted and reference estuaries, with a focus on New Bedford Harbor (MA, USA), a PCB Superfund site, and nearby reference sites. Results: We identified 98 single nucleotide polymorphisms within three AHR-related loci among all populations, including synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions. Haplotype distributions were spatially segregated and F-statistics suggested strong population genetic structure at these loci, consistent with previous studies showing strong population genetic structure at other F. heteroclitus loci. Genetic diversity at these three loci was not significantly different in contaminated sites as compared to reference sites. However, for AHR2 the New Bedford Harbor population had significant F§ssub§ST§esub§ values in comparison to the nearest reference populations. Tests for positive selection revealed ten nonsynonymous polymorphisms in AHR1 and four in AHR2. Four nonsynonymous SNPs in AHR1 and three in AHR2 showed large differences in base frequency between New Bedford Harbor and its reference site. Tests for isolation-by-distance revealed evidence for non-neutral change at the AHR2 locus. Conclusion: Together, these data suggest that F. heteroclitus populations in reference and polluted sites have similar genetic diversity, providing no evidence for strong genetic bottlenecks for populations in polluted locations. However, the data provide evidence for genetic differentiation among sites, selection at specific nucleotides in AHR1 and AHR2, and specific AHR2 SNPs and haplotypes that are associated with the PCB-resistant phenotype in the New Bedford Harbor population. The results suggest that AHRs, and especially AHR2, may be important, recurring targets for selection in local adaptation to dioxin-like aromatic hydrocarbon contaminants. © 2014 Reitzel et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Convergent evolution; Local adaptation; Molecular mechanism; Pollution; Population genetics; Resistance; Tolerance","adaptation; data acquisition; fish; genetic differentiation; genetic isolation; habitat quality; habitat selection; migratory population; pollution tolerance; Atlantic Ocean; United States; Cyprinodontoidei; Fundulus heteroclitus; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; fish protein; polychlorinated biphenyl; adaptation; animal; article; ecosystem; Fundulidae; gene locus; genetic selection; genetics; metabolism; North America; nucleotide sequence; phenotype; physiology; single nucleotide polymorphism; water pollution; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Base Sequence; Ecosystem; Fish Proteins; Fundulidae; Genetic Loci; North America; Phenotype; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Selection, Genetic; Water Pollution, Chemical",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Here, we investigate selection in pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) using genome scans coupled with inference from a haploid-assisted linkage map. Pink salmon have a strict 2-year semelparous life history which has resulted in temporally isolated (allochronic) lineages that remain sympatric through sharing of spawning habitats in alternate years. The lineages differ in a range of adaptive traits, suggesting different genetic backgrounds. We used genotyping by sequencing of haploids to generate a high-density linkage map with 7035 loci and screened an existing panel of 8036 loci for signatures of selection. The linkage map enabled identification of novel genomic regions displaying signatures of parallel selection shared between lineages. Furthermore, 24 loci demonstrated divergent selection and differences in genetic diversity between lineages, suggesting that adaptation in the 2 lineages has arisen from different pools of standing genetic variation.

While the causes for this decline may be complex and numerous, increased mortality at sea is predicted to be one of the major contributing factors. Examining the potential changes occurring in the genome-wide composition of populations during this migration has the potential to tease apart some of the factors influencing marine mortality. Here, we genotyped 5568 SNPs in Atlantic salmon populations representing two distinct regional genetic groups and across two cohorts to test for differential allelic and genotypic frequencies between juveniles (smolts) migrating to sea and adults (grilses) returning to freshwater after 1 year at sea. Given the complexity of the traits potentially associated with sea mortality, we contrasted the outcomes of a single-locus FST based genome scan method with a new multilocus framework to test for genetically based differential mortality at sea. While numerous outliers were identified by the single-locus analysis, no evidence for parallel, temporally repeated selection was found. In contrast, the multilocus approach detected repeated patterns of selection for a multilocus group of 34 covarying SNPs in one of the two populations. No significant pattern of selective mortality was detected in the other population, suggesting different causes of mortality among populations. These results first support the hypothesis that selection mainly causes small changes in allele frequencies among many covarying loci rather than a small number of changes in loci with large effects. They also point out that moving away from the a strict 'selective sweep paradigm' towards a multilocus genetics framework may be a more useful approach for studying the genomic signatures of natural selection on complex traits in wild populations. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Conservation; Local adaptation; Mortality at sea; Salmonids; Single nucleotide polymorphism","adaptation; animal; article; Atlantic salmon; conservation; gene frequency; genetic selection; genetics; genome; genomics; genotype; local adaptation; mortality at sea; multilocus sequence typing; population genetics; salmonids; single nucleotide polymorphism; conservation; local adaptation; mortality at sea; salmonids; single nucleotide polymorphism; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Gene Frequency; Genetics, Population; Genome; Genomics; Genotype; Multilocus Sequence Typing; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Salmo salar; Selection, Genetic",Article,"",Scopus

Genetic diversity is a multiscalar variable; it includes heterozygosity at the individual scale, genotypic diversity at the population scale, and local adaptation at the regional scale. The three scales of genetic diversity are predominantly studied in isolation to determine conservation status or restoration potential. However, synergisms among the three scales should enhance conservation and restoration assessments. We studied 49 genotypes of Vallisneria americana, a common freshwater submersed aquatic macrophyte that has seen catastrophic declines in its estuarine habitats. Two greenhouse experiments examined phenotypic traits and trade-offs and the effects of genetic diversity on the sustainability of V. americana populations. Clone size, an exploitative guerilla strategy, and plant height, a conservative phalanx strategy, were negatively associated, as were average turion size with clone size and turion abundance, suggesting that growth strategies trade-off to affect plant fitness. Leaf size and turion size were lower in individuals with lower heterozygosity. Early clonal expansion and flowering frequency were enhanced when genotypic richness was higher. Coefficients of variation revealed that opportunities for selection differed across V. americana source beds. We demonstrate that the three scales of genetic diversity work together to determine population performance and evolutionary potential.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) can overcome most of these limitations, and it is increasingly being applied in population genetic studies of multigene families. Here, we critically review NGS bioinformatic approaches that have been used to genotype the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) immune genes, and we discuss how the significant advances made in this field are applicable to population genetic studies of gene families. Increasingly, approaches are introduced that apply thresholds of sequencing depth and sequence similarity to separate alleles from methodological artefacts. We explain why these approaches are particularly sensitive to methodological biases by violating fundamental genotyping assumptions. An alternative strategy that utilizes ultra-deep sequencing (hundreds to thousands of sequences per amplicon) to reconstruct genotypes and applies statistical methods on the sequencing depth to separate alleles from artefacts appears to be more robust. Importantly, the 'degree of change' (DOC) method avoids using arbitrary cut-off thresholds by looking for statistical boundaries between the sequencing depth for alleles and artefacts, and hence, it is entirely repeatable across studies. Although the advances made in generating NGS data are still far ahead of our ability to perform reliable processing, analysis and interpretation, the community is developing statistically rigorous protocols that will allow us to address novel questions in evolution, ecology and genetics of multigene families.

We first use individual-based simulations to demonstrate that comparisons between populations adapted in parallel to similar environments from shared variation reveal a characteristic genomic signature around a selected locus: a low-divergence valley centred at the locus and flanked by twin peaks of high divergence. This signature is initiated by the hitchhiking of haplotype tracts differing between derived populations in the broader neighbourhood of the selected locus (driving the high-divergence twin peaks) and shared haplotype tracts in the tight neighbourhood of the locus (driving the low-divergence valley). This initial hitchhiking signature is reinforced over time because the selected locus acts as a barrier to gene flow from the source to the derived populations, thus promoting divergence by drift in its close neighbourhood. We next empirically confirm the peak-valley-peak signature by combining targeted and RAD sequence data at three candidate adaptation genes in multiple marine (source) and freshwater (derived) populations of threespine stickleback. Finally, we use a genome-wide screen for the peak-valley-peak signature to discover additional genome regions involved in parallel marine-freshwater divergence. Our findings offer a new explanation for heterogeneous genomic divergence and thus challenge the standard view that peaks in population divergence harbour divergently selected loci and that low-divergence regions result from balancing selection or localized introgression. We anticipate that genome scans for peak-valley-peak divergence signatures will promote the discovery of adaptation genes in other organisms.

We found evidence of simple population differentiation in both species, and in the species with previously identified population structure and phenotypic local adaptation, we found several hundred genes that responded in a synchronized and localized fashion. These genes were primarily involved in energy metabolism and oxidative stress, and expression levels were most divergent between populations in the same environment in which we previously detected divergence for metabolism. We found no localized genes in the species with less population structure and for which no local adaptation was previously detected.

Using a large SNP data set from 259 RAD-sequenced European eel individuals (glass eels) from eight locations between 34 and 64oN, we examined the patterns of genome-wide genetic diversity across locations. We tested for local selection by searching for increased population differentiation using FST-based outlier tests and by testing for significant associations between allele frequencies and environmental variables. The overall low genetic differentiation found (FST = 0.0007) indicates that most of the genome is homogenized by gene flow, providing further evidence for genomic panmixia in the European eel. The lack of genetic substructuring was consistent at both nuclear and mitochondrial SNPs. Using an extensive number of diagnostic SNPs, results showed a low occurrence of hybrids between European and American eel, mainly limited to Iceland (5.9%), although individuals with signatures of introgression several generations back in time were found in mainland Europe. Despite panmixia, a small set of SNPs showed high genetic differentiation consistent with single-generation signatures of spatially varying selection acting on glass eels. After screening 50 354 SNPs, a total of 754 potentially locally selected SNPs were identified. Candidate genes for local selection constituted a wide array of functions, including calcium signalling, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and circadian rhythm. Remarkably, one of the candidate genes identified is PERIOD, possibly related to differences in local photoperiod associated with the &gt;30 difference in latitude between locations. Genes under selection were spread across the genome, and there were no large regions of increased differentiation as expected when selection occurs within just a single generation due to panmixia. This supports the conclusion that most of the genome is homogenized by gene flow that removes any effects of diversifying selection from each new generation. © 2014 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.","anguilla; local adaptation; panmixia; spatially varying selection","mitochondrial DNA; Anguilla; Anguilla (fish); animal; article; DNA sequence; Europe; gene flow; gene frequency; genetic selection; genetics; local adaptation; molecular evolution; panmixia; population genetics; single nucleotide polymorphism; spatially varying selection; anguilla; local adaptation; panmixia; spatially varying selection; Anguilla; Animals; DNA, Mitochondrial; Europe; Evolution, Molecular; Gene Flow; Gene Frequency; Genetics, Population; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Selection, Genetic; Sequence Analysis, DNA",Article,"",Scopus

Phoretic deutonymphs are able to produce a pedicel, a stalk-like temporary attachment structure that connects the mite with the carrier. The aim of our study was to determine whether localization and density of phoretic deutonymphs on the carrier affect pedicel length. The study was conducted on a common phoretic mite - Uropoda orbicularis (Uropodina) and two aphodiid beetles - Aphodius prodromus and Aphodius distinctus. Our results show that pedicel length is influenced by the localization of deutonymphs on the body of the carrier. The longest pedicels are produced by deutonymphs attached to the upper part of elytra, whereas deutonymphs attached to femora and trochanters of the third pair of legs and the apex of elytra construct the shortest pedicels. In general, deutonymphs attached to more exposed parts of the carrier produce longer pedicels, whereas shorter pedicels are produced when deutonymphs are fixed to non-exposed parts of the carrier. A second factor influencing pedicel length is the density of attached deutonymphs. Mean pedicel length and deutonymph densities were highly correlated: higher deutonymph density leads to the formation of longer pedicels. The cause for this correlation is discussed, and we conclude that pedicel length variability can increase successful dispersal. © 2014 The Author(s).","Attachment structures; Dung beetles; Mites; Pedicel; Phoresy; Uropodina","beetle; dispersal; larva; local adaptation; mite; morphology; phoresy; Acari; Aphodiinae; Aphodius distinctus; Aphodius prodromus; Coleoptera; Hexapoda; Mesostigmata; Parasitiformes; Uropoda orbicularis; Uropodina; animal; article; beetle; histology; mite; parasitology; physiology; population density; Animals; Beetles; Mites; Population Density",Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus

The objective of the present article is to characterize the main problems related to the use of resources and coastal management, leading to coastal erosion, from the perceptions of stakeholders and decision makers in the coastal zone of Pehuén Co and Monte Hermoso, Argentina. The fieldwork was performed by participative methodologies, while the results were analyzed under the institutional and social capital theoretical framework. One of the main results of the paper is that the lack of a strong social capital in the region and the existence of formal monitoring and sanctioning procedures developed by distant governmental institutions have increased the overexploitation of coast and beaches.

Here, we used next-generation sequencing restriction-associated DNA tags (RAD-seq) and a transcriptome assembled from RNA-seq data to analyse the genetic structure of northwestern Atlantic populations of the low-dispersal intertidal snail Nucella lapillus. Although previous studies in this region have detected almost no genetic structure in N. lapillus, our phylogenomic approach identified a well-supported split between northern and southern clades. By comparing RAD-seq data and our transcriptome assembly, we identified thousands of fixed single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between these latitudinal clades that map to protein-coding genes, including genes associated with heat stress tolerance.

Therefore, it remains unclear how often admixture acts as a true driver of colonisation success.

In more-recent analytical methods, the need to assign individuals to populations a priori (clustering algorithms) is relaxed, and spatial autocorrelation analysis of allele frequencies (SA) is used to infer finer-scale and potentially short-term dispersal distances. We applied multiple methods to study the population genetic structure of the riverine caddisfly Stenopsyche marmorata (Trichoptera:Stenopsychidae) from 4 adjacent catchments in northeastern Japan. We genotyped larval individuals (N = 532) from 30 sites at 8 polymorphic microsatellite loci. Fixation indices suggested low levels of genetic differentiation among populations (global F ST = 0.062, p < 0.01), and significant isolation-by-distance (IBD) indicated populations were in drift-migration equilibrium. Bayesian clustering separated S. marmorata into distinct upland (>250 m asl) and lowland populations, with different F ST values (upland F ST = 0.048, p < 0.01; lowland F ST = 0.029, p < 0.01) and significant IBD only among upland populations. Allele frequencies were significantly positively autocorrelated (Moran's I > 0, p < 0.05) at distances up to 18 km along streams and up to 12 km across terrestrial habitat. These values were similar to directly observed flight distance in a single generation for this species in the field. We conclude that the multiple-method approach revealed: 1) unexpected population subdivision between upland and lowland areas that may result from local adaptation, differences in phenology, and historical colonization by multiple lineages; and 2) fine-scale estimates of dispersal that match direct observations of flight and suggest gene flow is more pronounced along water courses in this species. © 2014 by The Society for Freshwater Science.","aquatic; catchment; freshwater; insect; Isolation by Distance; river; stream","allele; aquatic organism; autocorrelation; Bayesian analysis; caddisfly; catchment; dispersal; freshwater environment; gene flow; genetic drift; genetic marker; genotype; isolated population; local adaptation; phenology; population genetics; streamwater; Japan",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

A common difficulty, however, is that programs are founded with limited wild broodstock, and inbreeding can become increasingly difficult to avoid with successive generations in captivity. Program managers must choose between maintaining the genetic purity of populations, at the risk of inbreeding depression, or interbreeding populations, at the risk of outbreeding depression. We evaluate these relative risks in a captive-breeding program for 3 endangered populations of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). In each of 2 years, we released juvenile F1 and F2 interpopulation hybrids, backcrosses, as well as inbred and noninbred within-population crosstypes into 9 wild streams. Juvenile size and survival was quantified in each year. Few crosstype effects were observed, but interestingly, the relative fitness consequences of inbreeding and outbreeding varied from year to year. Temporal variation in environmental quality might have driven some of these annual differences, by exacerbating the importance of maternal effects on juvenile fitness in a year of low environmental quality and by affecting the severity of inbreeding depression differently in different years. Nonetheless, inbreeding was more consistently associated with a negative effect on fitness, whereas the consequences of outbreeding were less predictable. Considering the challenges associated with a sound risk assessment in the wild and given that the effect of inbreeding on fitness is relatively predictable, we suggest that risk can be weighted more strongly in terms of the probable outcome of outbreeding. Factors such as genetic similarities between populations and the number of generations in isolation can sometimes be used to assess outbreeding risk, in lieu of experimentation. © 2014 Society for Conservation Biology.","COSEWIC; Egg size; Environmental quality; Hatchery; Heterosis; Live gene banking; Local adaptation; Maternal effects; Population collapse; Population viability","brood stock; captive breeding; conservation genetics; egg size; endangered species; environmental quality; fitness; hatchery; heterosis; hybrid; inbreeding depression; juvenile; local adaptation; maternal effect; outcrossing; population viability analysis; risk assessment; salmonid; temporal variation; Salmo salar; animal; Atlantic salmon; breeding; Canada; cross breeding; environmental protection; genetic variability; genetics; inbreeding; risk assessment; Animals; Breeding; Conservation of Natural Resources; Crosses, Genetic; Genetic Variation; Inbreeding; Nova Scotia; Risk Assessment; Salmo salar",Article,"",Scopus

One method of investigating host-parasite systems is using a molecular approach. This is particularly important as analyses based solely on morphology or laboratory studies of parasites and their hosts do not take into account historical evolutionary interactions that can shape the distribution, abundance and population structure of parasites and their hosts. However, the predominant host-parasite coevolution literature has focused on terrestrial hosts and their parasites, and there still is a lack of studies in marine environments. Given that marine systems are generally more open than terrestrial ones, they provide fascinating opportunities for large-scale (as well as small-scale) geographic studies. Further, patterns and processes of genetic structuring and systematics are becoming more available across many different taxa (but especially fishes) in many marine systems, providing an excellent basis for examining whether parasites follow host population/species structure. In this chapter, we first highlight the factors and processes that challenge our ability to interpret evolutionary patterns of coevolution of hosts and their parasites in marine systems at different spatial, temporal and taxonomic scales. We then review the use of the most commonly utilized genetic markers in studying marine host-parasite systems. We give an overview and discuss which molecular methodologies resolve evolutionary relationships best and also discuss the applicability of new approaches, such as next-generation sequencing and studies utilizing functional markers to gain insights into more contemporary processes shaping host-parasite relationships. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Biogeography; Coevolution; Contemporary selection; Genetic marker; Host-parasite systems; Marine systems; Molecular ecology","cell nucleus DNA; internal transcribed spacer; large subunit ribosome DNA; microsatellite DNA; mitochondrial DNA; molecular marker; ribosome DNA; small subunit ribosome DNA; unclassified drug; Amphipoda; article; Asterias; cestode; coevolution; Decapoda (Crustacea); gastropod; genetic marker; host parasite interaction; local adaptation; marine environment; marine species; microsatellite marker; molecular evolution; molecular phylogeny; Monogenea; Myxozoa; nematode; nonhuman; Oncorhynchus tshawytscha; parasite development; population genetic structure; priority journal; rainbow trout; sea urchin; teleost; trematode; Biogeography; Coevolution; Contemporary selection; Genetic marker; Host-parasite systems; Marine systems; Molecular ecology; Animals; Aquatic Organisms; Biological Evolution; Genetic Markers; Host Specificity; Host-Parasite Interactions",Book Chapter,"",Scopus

For the first time, this was applied to monitor fish assemblages in the Kas Peninsula, Turkey, an area known for its important Lessepsian fish populations. For 3 years (2004, 2007 and 2010), fish assemblages were surveyed using underwater visual census by transect method. A total of 29 species was observed, seven of which were Lessepsian species. Results show a significant increase in the Lessepsian species over the study period. In 2004, they represented 34 % of the total abundance, increasing to >61 % in 2010. Differences were observed in the progression of populations between two invasive herbivores, Siganus rivulatus and Siganus luridus (Siganidae), and two native herbivores, Sparisoma cretense (Scaridae) and Sarpa salpa (Sparidae). The siganids were recorded each year in all sites, whereas S. cretense was regularly observed in fewer numbers, while S. salpa was rarely censused. Abundance of Siganus spp. increased threefold in 6 years while abundances of S. cretense and S. salpa remained stable. S. rivulatus was the most abundant among the four species. Its competitive superiority may be due to its greater adaptability to fluctuating environmental conditions and biological traits, e.g. rapid growth, earlier sexual maturity, high fecundity. Because siganids are herbivorous, their presence can strongly impact algal ecosystems. It is then important to follow their spreading at a large scale, but this can be challenging due to the limited number of scientists.

Outlier loci separated North Sea and Northern Portugal populations from all other Atlantic samples and revealed a strong differentiation among Western, Central and Eastern Mediterranean geographical samples. Significant correlation of allele frequencies at outlier loci with seawater surface temperature and salinity supported the hypothesis that populations might be adapted to local conditions. Such evidence highlights the importance of integrating information from neutral and adaptive evolutionary patterns towards a better assessment of genetic diversity. Accordingly, the generated outlier SNP data could be used for tackling illegal practices in hake fishing and commercialization as well as to develop explicit spatial models for defining management units and stock boundaries. © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.","environmental correlation; genome scan; local adaptation; outlier SNPs; salinity; temperature","Merluccius merluccius; Rexea solandri; animal; article; Atlantic Ocean; environmental correlation; fishery; Gadiformes; gene linkage disequilibrium; gene locus; genetics; genome scan; genotype; geography; local adaptation; Mediterranean Sea; North Sea; outlier SNPs; population genetics; salinity; single nucleotide polymorphism; temperature; environmental correlation; genome scan; local adaptation; outlier SNPs; salinity; temperature; Animals; Atlantic Ocean; Fisheries; Gadiformes; Genetic Loci; Genetics, Population; Genotype; Geography; Linkage Disequilibrium; Mediterranean Sea; North Sea; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",Article,"",Scopus

To uncover the basis of a complex trait like osmoregulation, genome-level analyses are sensible. We combine population genomic scans with genome expression profiling to discover candidate genes and pathways associated with divergence between osmotic environments. We compared transcriptome sequence divergence between multiple freshwater and saltwater populations of the rainwater killifish, Lucania parva. We also compared sequence divergence between L. parva and its sister species, Lucania goodei, a freshwater specialist. We found highly differentiated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between freshwater and saltwater L. parva populations in cell junction and ion transport genes, including V-type H+ ATPase. Between species, we found divergence in reproduction and osmotic stress genes. Genes that were differentially expressed between species during osmotic acclimation included genes involved in ion transport and cell volume regulation. Gene sets that were divergent in coding sequence and divergent in expression did not overlap, although they did converge in function. Like many studies using genomic scans, our approach may miss some loci that contribute to adaptation but have complicated patterns of allelic variation.

These outcomes can depend on population size, genetic variation, and the environmental context. Gene flow patterns may align with geographic distance (IBD-isolation by distance), whereby immigration rates are inversely proportional to the distance between populations. Alternatively gene flow may follow patterns of isolation by environment (IBE), whereby gene flow rates are higher among similar environments. Finally, gene flow may be highest among dissimilar environments (counter-gradient gene flow), the classic ""gene-swamping"" scenario. Here we survey relevant studies to determine the prevalence of each pattern across environmental gradients. Of 70 studies, we found evidence of IBD in 20.0%, IBE in 37.1%, and both patterns in 37.1%. In addition, 10.0% of studies exhibited counter-gradient gene flow. In total, 74.3% showed significant IBE patterns. This predominant IBE pattern of gene flow may have arisen directly through natural selection or reflect other adaptive and nonadaptive processes leading to nonrandom gene flow. It also precludes gene swamping as a widespread phenomenon.

However, the advent of affordable genome-wide sequences for large numbers of individuals is opening up new possibilities for the study of subdivided populations. In this review, we consider what the new tools and technologies may allow us to do. In particular, we encourage researchers to look beyond the description of variation and to use genomic tools to address new hypotheses, or old ones afresh.

This study investigated the relative role of isolation by distance (IBD) versus isolation by adaptation (IBA) in explaining population genetic structure in Abies alba and Larix decidua, based on 231 and 233 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) sampled across 36 and 22 natural populations, respectively, in the Alps and Apennines. Genetic structure was investigated for both geographical and environmental groups, using analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA). For each species, nine environmental groups were defined using climate variables selected from a multiple factor analysis. Complementary methods were applied to identify outliers based on these groups, and to test for IBD versus IBA. AMOVA showed weak but significant genetic structure for both species, with higher values in L. decidua. Among the potential outliers detected, up to two loci were found for geographical groups and up to seven for environmental groups. A stronger effect of IBD than IBA was found in both species; nevertheless, once spatial effects had been removed, temperature and soil in A. alba, and precipitation in both species, were relevant factors explaining genetic structure. Based on our findings, in the Alpine region, genetic structure seems to be affected by both geographical isolation and environmental gradients, creating opportunities for local adaptation. © 2013 New Phytologist Trust.","Environmental gradient; Isolation by adaptation; Isolation by distance; Landscape genetics; Outlier locus detection","coniferous tree; environmental effect; environmental gradient; genetic marker; genetic structure; local adaptation; outlier; population genetics; reproductive isolation; subalpine environment; Alps; Apennines; Italy; Abies; Abies alba; Coniferophyta; Larix; Larix decidua; plant DNA; Abies; adaptation; analysis of variance; article; climate; comparative study; DNA sequence; ecosystem; environment; environmental gradient; gene locus; genetic isolation by distance; genetic variability; genetics; genotype; geography; isolation by adaptation; landscape genetics; Larix; outlier locus detection; Pinaceae; population genetics; single nucleotide polymorphism; tree; environmental gradient; isolation by adaptation; isolation by distance; landscape genetics; outlier locus detection; Abies; Adaptation, Physiological; Analysis of Variance; Climate; DNA, Plant; Ecosystem; Environment; Genetic Loci; Genetic Structures; Genetics, Population; Genotype; Geography; Larix; Pinaceae; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Trees",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus

Yet local adaptation may be common in marine fish species as the vast and changing marine environment provides more chances for natural selection. Here, we used anonymous as well as known protein gene linked microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA to detect the population structure of the small yellow croaker (Larimichthys polyactis) in the Northwest Pacific marginal seas. Among these loci, we detected at least two microsatellites, anonymous H16 and HSP27 to be clearly under diversifying selection in outlier tests. Sequence cloning and analysis revealed that H16 was located in the intron of BAHCC1 gene. Landscape genetic analysis showed that H16 mutations were significantly associated with temperature, which further supported the diversifying selection at this locus. These marker types presented different patterns of population structure: (i) mitochondrial DNA phylogeny showed no evidence of genetic divergence and demonstrated only one glacial linage; (ii) population differentiation using putatively neutral microsatellites presented a pattern of high gene flow in the L. polyactis. In addition, several genetic barriers were identified; (iii) the population differentiation pattern revealed by loci under diversifying selection was rather different from that revealed by putatively neutral loci. The results above suggest local adaptation in the small yellow croaker. In summary, population genetic studies based on different marker types disentangle the effects of demographic history, migration, genetic drift and local adaptation on population structure and also provide valuable new insights for the design of management strategies in L. polyactis. © 2013 Wang et al.",,"heat shock protein 27; microsatellite DNA; mitochondrial DNA; animal tissue; article; BAHCC1 gene; controlled study; fish; gene; gene flow; gene locus; gene mutation; genetic association; genetic variability; intron; local adaptation; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; population differentiation; population genetics; population structure; small yellow croaker; temperature; unindexed sequence; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; DNA, Mitochondrial; Gene Flow; Genetic Loci; Microsatellite Repeats; Perciformes; Phylogeny",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

In the current study, we expand upon these studies by adding mitochondrial and nuclear markers. Mitochondrial results confirm previous findings.

To uncover the causes behind the patterns of genetic differentiation and adaptation among six populations of Leuciscus waleckii from Dali Basin (two populations, alkaline vs. freshwater) and Amur Basin (four populations, freshwater rivers vs. alkaline lake), a set of 21 unlinked polymorphic microsatellite markers and two mitochondrial DNA sequences (Cytb and D-loop) were applied to examine whether populations from different environments or habitats have distinct genetic differentiation and whether alkalinity is the major factor that caused population divergence. Bayesian analysis and principal component analysis as well as haplotype network analysis showed that these populations are primarily divided into two groups, which are congruent with geographic separation but not inconsistent with the habitat environment (alkalinity). Using three different approaches, outlier detection indicated that one locus, HLJYL017, may be under directional selection and involved in local adaptation processes. Overall, this study suggested that demographic events and selection of local environmental conditions including of alkalinity are jointly responsible for population divergence.

Here we explore patterns of adaptive and neutral genetic diversity in the disjunct natural populations of Pinus radiata (D. Don) from mainland California. A first-generation common garden of 447 individuals revealed significant differentiation of wood phenotypes among populations (PST), possibly reflecting local adaptation in response to environment. We subsequently screened all trees for genetic diversity at 149 candidate gene single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci for signatures of adaptation. Ten loci were identified as being possible targets of diversifying selection following F ST outlier tests. Multivariate canonical correlation performed on a data set of 444 individuals identified significant covariance between environment, adaptive phenotypes and outlier SNP diversity, lending support to the case for local adaptation suggested from F ST and PST tests. Covariation among discrete sets of outlier SNPs and adaptive phenotypes (inferred from multivariate loadings) with environment are supported by existing studies of candidate gene function and genotype-phenotype association. Canonical analyses failed to detect significant correlations between environment and 139 non-outlier SNP loci, which were applied to estimate neutral patterns of genetic differentiation among populations (F ST 4.3 %). Using this data set, significant hierarchical structure was detected, indicating three populations on the mainland. The hierarchical relationships based on neutral SNP markers (and SSR) were in contrast with those inferred from putatively adaptive loci, potentially highlighting the independent action of selection and demography in shaping genetic structure in this species. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Differentiation; Local adaptation; Population structure; Radiata pine; SNP","Pinus radiata; Radiata",Article,"",Scopus

Rapid ecological diversification is common in fishes; however, the role of phenotypic plasticity and adaptation to local environments is poorly understood. It is now possible to investigate genetic patterns to make inferences regarding phenotypic traits under selection and possible mechanisms underlying ecotype divergence, particularly where similar novel phenotypes have arisen in multiple independent populations. Here, we employed a bottom-up approach to test for signatures of directional selection associated with divergence of beach- and stream-spawning kokanee, the obligate freshwater form of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Beach- and stream-spawners co-exist in many post-glacial lakes and exhibit distinct reproductive behaviours, life-history traits and spawning habitat preferences. Replicate ecotype pairs across five lakes in British Columbia, Canada were genotyped at 57 expressed sequence tag-linked and anonymous microsatellite loci identified in a previous genome scan. Fifteen loci exhibited signatures of directional selection (high FST outliers), four of which were identified in multiple lakes. However, the lack of parallel genetic patterns across all lakes may be a result of: 1) an inability to detect loci truly under selection; 2) alternative genetic pathways underlying ecotype divergence in this system; and/or 3) phenotypic plasticity playing a formative role in driving kokanee spawning habitat differences. Gene annotations for detected outliers suggest pathogen resistance and energy metabolism as potential mechanisms contributing to the divergence of beach- and stream-spawning kokanee, but further study is required. © 2013 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.","Adaptation; Expressed sequence tag-linked microsatellites; Life history evolution; Population genomics; Sockeye salmon","beach; divergence; genetic marker; genomics; glacial lake; habitat selection; intraspecific variation; life history trait; local adaptation; pathogen; phenotypic plasticity; salmonid; spawning; stream; British Columbia; Canada; Oncorhynchus; Oncorhynchus nerka; Pisces; adaptation; animal; article; Canada; classification; ecology; expressed sequence tag-linked microsatellites; genetics; geography; life history evolution; phylogeny; physiology; population genomics; reproduction; salmon; Sockeye salmon; adaptation; expressed sequence tag-linked microsatellites; life history evolution; population genomics; sockeye salmon; Animals; British Columbia; Ecology; Geography; Phylogeny; Reproduction; Salmon",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus

Given that evolutionary adaptation has led to finely tuned traits with narrow physiological limits in these organisms, this system provides a unique opportunity to examine physiological trade-offs and limits of adaptive responses to environmental perturbation. As such, notothenioids have a rich history with respect to studies attempting to understand the vulnerability of polar ecosystems to the negative impacts associated with global climate change. Unfortunately, despite being a model system for understanding physiological adaptations to extreme environments, we still lack fundamental molecular tools for much of the Nototheniidae family.Results: Specimens of the emerald notothen, Trematomus bernacchii, were acclimated for 28 days in flow-through seawater tanks maintained near ambient seawater temperatures (-1.5°C) or at +4°C. Following acclimation, tissue specific cDNA libraries for liver, gill and brain were created by pooling RNA from n = 5 individuals per temperature treatment. The tissue specific libraries were bar-coded and used for 454 pyrosequencing, which yielded over 700 thousand sequencing reads. A de novo assembly and annotation of these reads produced a functional transcriptome library of T. bernacchii containing 30,107 unigenes, 13,003 of which possessed significant homology to a known protein product. Digital gene expression analysis of these extremely cold adapted fish reinforced the loss of an inducible heat shock response and allowed the preliminary exploration into other elements of the cellular stress response.Conclusions: Preliminary exploration of the transcriptome of T. bernacchii under elevated temperatures enabled a semi-quantitative comparison to prior studies aimed at characterizing the thermal response of this endemic fish whose size, abundance and distribution has established it as a pivotal species in polar research spanning several decades.The comparison of these findings to previous studies demonstrates the efficacy of transcriptomics and digital gene expression analysis as tools in future studies of polar organisms and has greatly increased the available genomic resources for the suborder Notothenioidei, particularly in the Trematominae subfamily. © 2013 Huth and Place; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"complementary DNA; RNA; sea water; transcriptome; heat shock protein 70; transcriptome; animal tissue; article; brain; cellular stress response; cold acclimatization; controlled study; de novo assembly; DNA library; emerald notothen; gene expression; gene sequence; genomics; gill; heat shock response; liver; nonhuman; Perciformes; population abundance; population distribution; population size; pyrosequencing; tissue specificity; transcriptomics; Trematomus bernacchii; water temperature; acclimatization; adaptation; animal; Antarctica; antibody specificity; biosynthesis; gene expression regulation; genetics; genome; temperature; Acclimatization; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Antarctic Regions; Gene Expression Regulation; Genome; HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins; Organ Specificity; Perciformes; Seawater; Temperature; Transcriptome",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Using a medium-density SNP array, we documented genomic diversity and divergence at 2336 genetically mapped loci among three pairs of North American anadromous and freshwater Atlantic salmon populations. Our results show that across the genome, freshwater populations have lower diversity and a smaller proportion of private polymorphism relative to anadromous populations. Moreover, differentiation was more pronounced among freshwater than among anadromous populations at multiple spatial scales, suggesting a large effect of genetic drift in these isolated freshwater populations. Using nonhierarchical and hierarchical genome scans, we identified hundreds of markers spread across the genome that are potentially under divergent selection between anadromous and freshwater populations, but few outlier loci were repeatedly found in all three freshwater-anadromous comparisons. Similarly, a sliding window analysis revealed numerous regions of high divergence that were nonparallel among the three comparisons. These last results show little evidence for the parallel evolution of alleles selected for in freshwater populations, but suggest nonparallel adaptive divergence at many loci of small effects distributed through the genome.

We compared growth, maturation schedules and reproductive investment of female sole Solea solea between 8 populations, covering much of the species' distribution in northern Europe, with respect to thermal gradients. An energy allocation model was fitted to size-age data, and probabilistic maturation reaction norms were estimated from size-age-maturity data. We found that northern populations from colder environments had higher rates of energy acquisition and reproductive investment, an intrinsic tendency to mature earlier, and had smaller asymptotic sizes than southern populations from warmer environments. Consequently, growth rate was higher before maturation but lower after maturation in the north compared to the south. This is opposite to Bergmann's rule according to which slower growth, delayed maturation and larger asymptotic sizes are usually observed at lower temperatures.

The use of transcriptomics to quantify population differences in genetically controlled functional gene expression traits holds promise for investigating this divergence associated with possible local adaptation. We use custom microarrays to characterize population divergence in transcription at functionally relevant (metabolic and immune function) genes among tributary populations of rainbow trout from Babine Lake, BC and compare it to neutral divergence estimated from microsatellite markers. Transcriptional divergence (PST) was determined at resting state and in response to metabolic and immune challenges, two major sources of mortality and thus selective forces on juvenile salmonids. Results indicate that the majority of selected genes [56 genes (65%), 64 genes (63%) and 38 genes (78%) under control, temperature and immune challenges respectively] show transcriptional divergence (PST &gt; FST) that is consistent with the action of divergent selection. Patterns of pairwise PST among populations are inconsistent with evolution by drift. In general, it appears that the magnitude and pattern of population divergence in transcription reflect the action of natural selection and identify selection on transcription as a mechanism for local adaptation.

Using local stock reduces the chances of outbreeding depression or genetic dilution, whereas mixing sources may increase diversity and counteract inbreeding depression. Evaluation of these opposing approaches remains difficult when planning a restoration project but is needed to increase chances of long-term population persistence. We evaluated seed production and germination success of seeds from controlled reproductive crosses of the submersed aquatic plant Vallisneria americana (wild celery) collected from populations throughout the Chesapeake Bay. We assessed differences in seeds, capsules, and germination success in three types of crosses: (1) individuals within-populations, (2) among-populations but within-genetically differentiated regions, and (3) among-regions. We observed population level differences in within-population and among-region crosses. Levels of genetic relatedness among individuals, genetic diversity within populations, or differentiation across populations did not predict reproductive success.

As indicated by reduced rates of survival and increased rates of malformation, I found evidence for maladaptation in road adjacent populations. This response is in direct counterpoint to recently described local adaption by a cohabiting species of amphibian. These results suggest that while divergence might commonly follow habitat modification, the direction of its outcome cannot be generalized even in identical habitats. Further, maladaptive responses can be associated with a more generalized depression effect that transcends the local environment. Alongside recent reports, these results suggest that maladaptive responses may be an emerging consequence of human-induced environmental change.

This work typically assumes that density-dependent survival affects individuals equally, but individuals in natural population rarely compete equally. Among-individual differences in resource use generate stronger competition between more similar phenotypes (frequency-dependent competition) but it remains unclear how this additional form of selection changes the interactions between population size, gene flow, and local stabilizing selection. Here, we integrate migration-selection dynamics with frequency-dependent competition. We developed a coupled demographic-quantitative genetic model consisting of two patches connected by dispersal and subject to local stabilizing selection and competition. Our model shows that frequency-dependent competition slightly increases local adaptation, greatly increases genetic variance within patches, and reduces the amount that migration depresses population size, despite the increased genetic variance load. The effects of frequency-dependence depend on the strength of divergent selection, trait heritability, and when mortality occurs in the life cycle in relation to migration and reproduction. Essentially, frequency-dependent competition reduces the density-dependent interactions between migrants and residents, the extent to which depends on how different and common immigrants are compared to residents. Our results add new dynamics that illustrate how competition can alter the effects of gene flow and divergent selection on local adaptation and population carrying capacities. © 2013 The Author(s).

Anadromous Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) display a complex migratory behaviour that makes the distinction between breeding and nonbreeding dispersal especially important. This species does not reproduce every year, but individuals must migrate to fresh water to overwinter such that a large proportion of fish running up-river are not in breeding condition and have no potential for gene flow. We used a genetic assignment approach to identify dispersers among populations of char from Baffin Island, Canada. Estimates of dispersal varied between 15.8% and 25.5% depending on the assignment method, suggesting that Arctic char disperse at a higher rate than other salmonids. Nonbreeding individuals were more likely to use non-natal habitats than breeding individuals, thus resulting in estimates of dispersal that overestimate the potential for gene flow among populations. Finally, we parameterized a population genetic model showing that gene flow is probably sufficiently low to allow for local adaptation among populations, given realistic selection coefficients.

Australian populations of barramundi (Lates calcarifer) show strong evidence of local adaptation to temperature. However, the phenotypic consequences of this adaptation are unknown and the genetic mechanisms underlying this response are poorly understood. In the current study, two populations of barramundi from temperature extremes of the species Australian distribution were communally reared at cool (22. °C), control (28. °C) and hot (36. °C) water temperatures for 3.5. months. Southern populations of barramundi originating from a cooler environment grew significantly faster at 22. °C than northern populations of warm adapted barramundi. However, no difference in population growth was present at either 28. °C or 36. °C. The underlying transcriptome profile of barramundi was examined via Illumina mRNA deep sequencing to determine the major contributing gene categories giving rise to phenotypic differences in barramundi population growth. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed enrichment in categories relating to the regulation of peptidase activity as well as microtubule, cytoplasmic and cellular metabolic based processes. Further analysis of the GO category ""microtubule based process"" with associated genes from the ""response to stress"" category revealed an apparent re-organization of cytoskeletal elements in response to an induced cold stress in northern barramundi reared at 22. °C, when compared with northern barramundi reared at 36. °C. Between southern barramundi and northern barramundi reared at 36. °C, an analysis of the ""endopeptidase inhibitor activity"" GO category in conjunction with stress genes indicated a suppression of the complement system in southern barramundi along with an increase in the cellular stress response.The results of the present study show that southern populations of barramundi exhibit underlying molecular adaptation to cooler water temperatures, but still retain a tolerance for warm water temperatures. Furthermore, GO profiling has revealed groups of genes that underlie population differences in temperature tolerance as a means to prioritize the analysis of differential gene expression in studies of local adaptation in the future. © 2013 .","Fish; Gene expression; Gene ontology; Local adaptation; Next-Gen sequencing; Temperature tolerance","Lates calcarifer; transcriptome; acclimatization; animal; article; Australia; DNA sequence; fish; gene expression; gene expression profiling; gene ontology; genetics; local adaptation; Next-Gen sequencing; Perciformes; physiology; population density; population dynamics; population genetics; temperature; Temperature tolerance; Fish; Gene expression; Gene ontology; Local adaptation; Next-Gen sequencing; Temperature tolerance; Acclimatization; Animals; Australia; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Ontology; Genetics, Population; Perciformes; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Temperature; Transcriptome",Article,"",Scopus

Population divergence (FST ≈ 0.026) and structuring (five genetic clusters) was significantly more pronounced in the genic as compared to nongenic markers (FST ≈ 0.008; no genetic clusters). Patterns of divergence in the genic markers-45% of which were identified as outliers-correlated with local differences in salinity. Yet, a strong positive correlation between divergence in genic and nongenic markers, and their association with environmental factors suggests that adaptive divergence is reducing gene flow across the genome.

However, a particular genomic pattern can often arise via different combinations of various processes such as selection, gene flow, recombination, mutation, genetic drift, and demographic variability. Thus, substantial challenges remain in elucidating which evolutionary processes generated observed genomic patterns. Nonetheless, the studies in this section demonstrate ways forward toward bridging pattern and process, including experimental work, genetic mapping, increased knowledge of natural history and demography, and comparative studies spanning taxa at different points in the speciation continuum.

We show that inshore corals are more tolerant of a 6-week temperature stress than offshore corals.

One approach to examining population responses to disturbance in species with complex life histories is to study species that exhibit spatial patterns in their phenotypic response across populations or demes. In this study, we investigate a threatened population of fall chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in the Snake River of Idaho, in which a significant fraction of the juvenile population have been shown to exhibit a yearling out-migration strategy which had not previously been thought to exist. It has been suggested that dam-related environmental changes may have altered the selective pressures experienced by out-migrating fall chinook, driving evolution of a later and more selectively advantageous migration strategy. Using isotopic analysis of otoliths from returning adult spawners, we reconstructed the locations of individual fish at three major juvenile life stages to determine if the representation of the yearling life history was geographically structured within the population. We reconstructed juvenile locations for natal, rearing and overwintering life stages in each of the major spawning areas in the basin. Our results indicate that the yearling life-history strategy is predominantly represented within one of the main spawning regions, the Clearwater River, rather than being distributed throughout the basin. Previous studies have shown the Clearwater River to have cooler temperatures, later hatch dates, and later outmigration of juveniles, indicating a link between environment and expression of the yearling life history. Our data suggest that this new yearling life history may be disproportionally represented in returning adult spawners, indicating selection for this life history within the population. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Chinook salmon; Juvenile migration; Local adaptation; Otolith microchemistry; Phenotypic plasticity","adult; environmental conditions; environmental disturbance; fish; fitness; isotopic analysis; juvenile; life history trait; local adaptation; migration; overwintering; phenotypic plasticity; rearing; selection; spawning; Clearwater River [Idaho]; Idaho; Snake River; United States; Oncorhynchus tshawytscha; animal; article; chemistry; female; geography; growth, development and aging; life cycle stage; male; population migration; river; salmon; United States; Animal Migration; Animals; Female; Geography; Life Cycle Stages; Male; Northwestern United States; Rivers; Salmon",Article,"",Scopus

Although a growing body of literature documents negative effects of acidification on marine organisms, the majority of this work has focused on the effects of future conditions on modern populations, ignoring the potential effects of adaptation and physiological acclimatization. We review current literature on the potential for adaptation to elevated pCO2 in marine organisms. Although this body of work is currently quite small, we argue that data on the physiological effects of acidification, natural variation in pH and lessons learned from previous work on thermal adaptation can all inform predictions and priorities for future research. Spatially varying selection is one of the most important forces maintaining intraspecific genetic variation. Unlike temperature, pH lacks a strong and persistent global gradient, and so selection may maintain less adaptive variation for pH than for temperature. On the other hand, we are only beginning to amass long-term data sets for pH variation in natural habitats, and thus, pH gradients may be more common than previously observed. Two of the most important effects of elevated pCO2 are reduced calcification and changes in metabolism. We discuss the ways that a detailed understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying these effects is key to predicting the capacity for acclimatization and adaptation. Important priorities for future research will be to assess local adaptation to pH conditions and to measure the capacity for adaptation to future acidified conditions in natural populations.

However, nearly all this work has focused on the effects of future conditions on modern populations, neglecting the role of adaptation. Rapid evolution can alter demographic responses to environmental change, ultimately affecting the likelihood of population persistence, but the capacity for adaptation will differ among populations and species. Here, we measure the capacity of the ecologically important purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus to adapt to OA, using a breeding experiment to estimate additive genetic variance for larval size (an important component of fitness) under future high-pCO2/low-pH conditions. Although larvae reared under future conditions were smaller than those reared under present-day conditions, we show that there is also abundant genetic variation for body size under elevated pCO2, indicating that this trait can evolve. The observed heritability of size was 0.40 ± 0.32 (95% CI) under low pCO2, and 0.50 ± 0.30 under high-pCO2 conditions. Accounting for the observed genetic variation in models of future larval size and demographic rates substantially alters projections of performance for this species in the future ocean. Importantly, our model shows that after incorporating the effects of adaptation, the OA-driven decrease in population growth rate is up to 50% smaller, than that predicted by the 'no-adaptation' scenario. Adults used in the experiment were collected from two sites on the coast of the Northeast Pacific that are characterized by different pH regimes, as measured by autonomous sensors. Comparing results between sites, we also found subtle differences in larval size under high-pCO2 rearing conditions, consistent with local adaptation to carbonate chemistry in the field. These results suggest that spatially varying selection may help to maintain genetic variation necessary for adaptation to future OA. © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.","Climate change; Local adaptation; Marine invertebrates; Ocean acidification; Quantitative genetics; Rapid evolution","carbon dioxide; carbonic acid derivative; sea water; acidification; body size; climate change; echinoderm; genetic variation; growth rate; heritability; keystone species; larva; local adaptation; pH; population growth; water chemistry; adaptation; animal; article; body size; chemistry; climate change; genetic polymorphism; genetics; larva; local adaptation; marine invertebrates; metabolism; ocean acidification; pH; phenotype; physiology; quantitative genetics; rapid evolution; Strongylocentrotus purpuratus; United States; climate change; local adaptation; marine invertebrates; ocean acidification; quantitative genetics; rapid evolution; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Body Size; California; Carbon Dioxide; Carbonates; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Larva; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Genetic; Seawater; Strongylocentrotus purpuratus; Echinoidea; Invertebrata; Strongylocentrotus purpuratus",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

In endangered species, adaptive potential may be eroded by decreased population sizes and processes that further reduce gene flow such as philopatry and local adaptations. Here, we focused on the philopatric and endangered loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) nesting in Cape Verde as a model system to investigate the link between adaptive potential and philopatry. We produced a dataset of three complementary genomic regions to investigate female philopatric behaviour (mitochondrial DNA), male-mediated gene flow (microsatellites) and adaptive potential (major histocompatibility complex, MHC). Results revealed genetically distinct nesting colonies, indicating remarkably small-scale philopatric behaviour of females. Furthermore, these colonies also harboured local pools of MHC alleles, especially at the margins of the population's distribution, which are therefore important reserves of additional diversity for the population. Meanwhile, directional male-mediated gene flow from the margins of distribution sustains the adaptive potential for the entire rookery. We therefore present the first evidence for a positive association between philopatry and locally adapted genomic regions. Contrary to expectation, we propose that philopatry conserves a high adaptive potential at the margins of a distribution, while asymmetric gene flow maintains genetic connectivity with the rest of the population. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Such differences could have origins in acclimation or in genetically fixed variation between habitats. Here we use common-garden experiments to evaluate differences in gene expression between populations of the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, spanning 1700 km and average temperature differences of 5°C to 8°C. Across expression profiles from 18,883 genes after 3 years of common conditions, we find highly correlated expression patterns (Pearson's r = 0.992) among most genes. However, 66 genes were differentially expressed, including many ribosomal protein and biomineralization genes, which had higher expression in urchins originally from the southern population. Gene function analyses revealed slight but pervasive expression differences in genes related to ribosomal function, metabolism, transport, ""bone"" development, and response to stimuli. In accord with gene expression patterns, a post-hoc spine regrowth experiment revealed that urchins of southern origin regrew spines at a faster rate than northern urchins. These results suggest that there may be genetically controlled, potentially adaptive differences in gene regulation across habitats and that gene expression differences may be under strong enough selection to overcome high, dispersal-mediated gene flow in this marine species. © 2013 The Society for the Study of Evolution.","Climate change; ecological genomics; gene flow; natural selection; RNA-seq; Strongylocentrotus purpuratus","acclimation; adaptation; biomineralization; climate change; echinoderm; gene expression; genomics; growth rate; growth regulator; habitat type; heterogeneity; landscape; natural selection; physiology; protein; RNA; temperature effect; animal; article; climate change; ecosystem; gene expression profiling; gene flow; genetics; growth, development and aging; metagenomics; natural selection; physiology; population genetics; RNA-seq; Strongylocentrotus purpuratus; temperature; United States; Climate change; ecological genomics; gene flow; natural selection; RNA-seq; Strongylocentrotus purpuratus; Animals; California; Ecosystem; Gene Expression Profiling; Genetics, Population; Oregon; Strongylocentrotus purpuratus; Temperature; Echinoidea; Strongylocentrotus purpuratus",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus

Triggered by environmental cues, populations produce resting eggs that allow them to survive temporally unsuitable conditions. Daphnia magna is a crustacean that reproduces by cyclical parthenogenesis, alternating between the production of asexual offspring and the sexual reproduction of diapausing eggs (ephippia). Prior to ephippia production, males (necessary to ensure ephippia fertilization) are produced parthenogenetically. Both the production of ephippia and the parthenogenetic production of males are induced by environmental factors. Here, we test the hypothesis that the induction of D. magna resting egg production shows a signature of local adaptation. We postulated that Daphnia from permanent ponds would produce fewer ephippia and males than Daphnia from intermittent ponds and that the frequency and season of habitat deterioration would correlate with the timing and amount of male and ephippia production. To test this, we quantified the production of males and ephippia in clonal D. magna populations in several different controlled environments. We found that the production of both ephippia and males varies strongly among populations in a way that suggests local adaptation. By performing quantitative trait locus mapping with parent clones from contrasting pond environments, we identified nonoverlapping genomic regions associated with male and ephippia production. As the traits are influenced by two different genomic regions, and both are necessary for successful resting egg production, we suggest that the genes for their induction co-evolve. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Daphnia magna; local adaptation; male production; quantitative trait locus mapping; resting eggs","microsatellite DNA; adaptation; animal; article; chromosome map; classification; Daphnia; ecosystem; environment; genetics; genotype; male; molecular evolution; parthenogenesis; population genetics; quantitative trait locus; season; single nucleotide polymorphism; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Chromosome Mapping; Daphnia; Ecosystem; Environment; Evolution, Molecular; Genetics, Population; Genotype; Male; Microsatellite Repeats; Parthenogenesis; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait Loci; Seasons; Crustacea; Daphnia; Daphnia magna; Invertebrata",Article,"",Scopus

After a bottleneck at introduction, its spread through the cactus distribution was probably very rapid as a result of natural dispersal from the site of introduction and from three other foci colonized from the introduction site by human intervention. By 1940, the Opuntia distribution and consequently that of D.buzzatii was reduced to spatially isolated populations, with probable further bottlenecking of at least some of the D.buzzatii populations. Allozyme data (primarily six polymorphic loci) from flies collected during April 1972 to February 1996 at 67 localities were used to examine current population differentiation and relationships, as well as to infer aspects of their demographic history. Although there is significant isolation-by-distance, genetic relationships among the populations are not simply related to geographical distance, implying that genetic drift has contributed to population differentiation. However, the biotic and, to an extent, the physical environment are not the same in Australia as in Argentina. Consequently, exposure to novel environments has led to local adaptation and further population differentiation. Genetic variation and the structure of Australian populations apparently are determined by founder effects (drift) at the level of individual breeding sites (cactus rots), by diversifying selection among rots within a locality, as well as by drift and geographically varying selection among localities.© 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 109, 682-698. © 2013 The Linnean Society of London.","Adaptation; Allozymes; Demographic inferences; Genetic differentiation; Genetic drift; Novel environments; Range expansion; Selection","allozyme; breeding site; cactus; colonization; demographic history; fly; founder effect; genetic drift; genetic variation; isolated population; local adaptation; natural selection; population bottleneck; population distribution; population structure; range expansion; Argentina; Australia; Cactaceae; Diptera; Drosophila buzzatii; Drosophilidae; Opuntia; Opuntia cacti",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus

Supplementary feeding at Heron Island increased food intake to levels equal to, or greater than, those observed at Lord Howe Island. In supplemented chicks, mass accumulation per gram of food received was inversely related to current body stores, up to a maximum storage level set by body size. Significantly, maximum storage was lower for Heron Island than for Lord Howe Island chicks at equivalent body size. In contrast, relative allocation to skeletal growth did not differ between supplemented and control chicks, was not influenced by body condition and did not increase to levels observed at Lord Howe Island. Overall, the present study showed that supplemented chicks were unable to use short-term increases in food availability to increase relative mass stores or rates of skeletal development, implying that both life-history parameters have some colony-specific components that are divergent between the locations of this study.

Our study system, the Alpine whitefish (Coregonus spp.) species complex is a classic example of a recent postglacial adaptive radiation: forming an array of endemic lake flocks, with the independent origination of similar ecotypes among flocks. However, many of the lakes of the Alpine radiation have been seriously impacted by anthropogenic nutrient enrichment, resulting in a collapse in neutral genetic and phenotypic differentiation within the most polluted lakes. Here we investigate the effects of eutrophication on the selective forces that have shaped this radiation, using population genomics. We studied eight sympatric species assemblages belonging to five independent parallel adaptive radiations, and one species pair in secondary contact. We used AFLP markers, and applied F§ssub§ST§ esub§ outlier (BayeScan, Dfdist) and logistic regression analyses (MatSAM), to identify candidate regions for disruptive selection in the genome and their associations with adaptive traits within each lake flock. The number of outlier and adaptive trait associated loci identified per lake were then regressed against two variables (historical phosphorus concentration and contemporary oxygen concentration) representing the strength of eutrophication. Results: Whilst we identify disruptive selection candidate regions in all lake flocks, we find similar trends, across analysis methods, towards fewer disruptive selection candidate regions and fewer adaptive trait/candidate loci associations in the more polluted lakes. Conclusions: Weakened disruptive selection and a concomitant breakdown in reproductive isolating mechanisms in more polluted lakes has lead to increased gene flow between coexisting Alpine whitefish species. We hypothesize that the resulting higher rates of interspecific recombination reduce either the number or extent of genomic islands of divergence surrounding loci evolving under disruptive natural selection. This produces the negative trend seen in the number of selection candidate loci recovered during genome scans of whitefish species flocks, with increasing levels of anthropogenic eutrophication: as the likelihood decreases that AFLP restriction sites will fall within regions of heightened genomic divergence and therefore be classified as F§ssub§ST§esub§ outlier loci.

In contrast, at smaller spatial scales within this region, adult abundance and recruitment varied by up to 15- and 100-fold, respectively, among some locations only tens of kilometres apart, and no obvious patterns in adult-recruit relationships were revealed towards the range limit. Local patterns of abundance and life-cycle relationships do not, therefore, translate to biogeographic scales, but investigation at this multitude of spatial scales helps to identify the defining processes that account for spatial variation and determine population structure towards the range limits of benthic marine invertebrates. © Inter-Research 2013.","Adult abundance; Intertidal barnacles; Larval supply; Recruitment; Supply side ecology","abundance; adult; benthos; biogeographical region; life cycle; local adaptation; marine ecosystem; range size; recruitment (population dynamics); Australia; Invertebrata; Tesseropora rosea; Thoracica",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

Four different processes can lead to intraspecific variation in social organization: (i) genetic variation between individuals owing to local adaptation (between populations) or evolutionarily stable strategies within populations; (ii) developmental plasticity evolved in long-term (more than one generation) unpredictable and short-term (one generation) predictable environments, which is mediated by organizational physiological effects during early ontogeny; (iii) social flexibility evolved in highly unpredictable environments, which is mediated by activational physiological effects in adults; (iv) entirely extrinsic factors such as the death of a dominant breeder. Variation in social behaviour occurs between individuals in the case of genetic variation and developmental plasticity, but within individuals in the case of social flexibility. It is important to study intraspecific variation in social organization to understand the social systems of species because it reveals the mechanisms by which species can adapt to changing environments, offers a useful tool to study the ultimate and proximate causes of sociality, and is an interesting phenomenon by itself that needs scientific explanation. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

An increasingly popular approach to study the role of selection for camouflage for evolutionary trajectories of animal colour patterns is to present images of prey on paper or computer screens to human 'predators'. Yet, few attempts have been made to confirm that rates of detection by humans can predict patterns of selection and evolutionary modifications of prey colour patterns in nature. In this study, we first analyzed encounters between human 'predators' and images of natural black, grey and striped colour morphs of the polymorphic Tetrix subulata pygmy grasshoppers presented on background images of unburnt, intermediate or completely burnt natural habitats. Next, we compared detection rates with estimates of capture probabilities and survival of free-ranging grasshoppers, and with estimates of relative morph frequencies in natural populations.Results: The proportion of grasshoppers that were detected and time to detection depended on both the colour pattern of the prey and on the type of visual background. Grasshoppers were detected more often and faster on unburnt backgrounds than on 50% and 100% burnt backgrounds. Striped prey were detected less often than grey or black prey on unburnt backgrounds; grey prey were detected more often than black or striped prey on 50% burnt backgrounds; and black prey were detected less often than grey prey on 100% burnt backgrounds. Rates of detection mirrored previously reported rates of capture by humans of free-ranging grasshoppers, as well as morph specific survival in the wild. Rates of detection were also correlated with frequencies of striped, black and grey morphs in samples of T. subulata from natural populations that occupied the three habitat types used for the detection experiment.Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that crypsis is background-dependent, and implicate visual predation as an important driver of evolutionary modifications of colour polymorphism in pygmy grasshoppers. Our study provides the clearest evidence to date that using humans as 'predators' in detection experiments may provide reliable information on the protective values of prey colour patterns and of natural selection and microevolution of camouflage in the wild. © 2013 Karpestam et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Biodiversity; Camouflage; Colour polymorphism; Crypsis; Evolution; Predation; Tetrix subulata","biodiversity; color morph; crypsis; detection method; evolutionary biology; grasshopper; habitat type; local adaptation; natural selection; polymorphism; predation; survival; wild population; Animalia; Caelifera; Tetrigidae; Tetrix subulata; animal; article; Caelifera; color; evolution; genetic polymorphism; genetic selection; genetics; human; physiology; population dynamics; predation; Caelifera; genetics; Animals; Biological Evolution; Color; Grasshoppers; Humans; Polymorphism, Genetic; Population Dynamics; Predatory Behavior; Selection, Genetic; Animals; Biological Evolution; Color; Grasshoppers; Humans; Polymorphism, Genetic; Population Dynamics; Predatory Behavior; Selection, Genetic",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Critical thermal maximum (CTmax) significantly differed among populations and temperature treatments. Populations with shorter migration distance and a lower migration and spawning temperature tended to have higher CTmax at 90 days posthatch. However, the relationship was reversed when fish of similar size were compared at 135-214 days posthatch. CTmax at 90 days posthatch was also positively related to body mass, which differed appreciably among populations at this development stage. With growth, the population differences in CTmax diminished from 3.1 to 1 °C. Elevated incubation temperature also decreased CTmax. Arrhenius breakpoint temperature (ABT) for maximum heart rate differed among populations incubated at 14 °C. The Chilko Lake population, which rear at 1.2 km above sea level, had the highest heart rate across all temperatures when incubated at 14 °C, but the lowest ABT among populations.

This ocean acidification has negative but variable impacts on individual performance in many marine species. However, little is known about the adaptive capacity of species to respond to an acidified ocean, and, as a result, predictions regarding future ecosystem responses remain incomplete. Here we demonstrate that ocean acidification generates striking patterns of genome-wide selection in purple sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) cultured under different CO2 levels. We examined genetic change at 19,493 loci in larvae from seven adult populations cultured under realistic future CO2 levels. Although larval development and morphology showed little response to elevated CO2, we found substantial allelic change in 40 functional classes of proteins involving hundreds of loci. Pronounced genetic changes, including excess amino acid replacements, were detected in all populations and occurred in genes for biomineraliza-tion, lipid metabolism, and ion homeostasis-gene classes that build skeletons and interact in pH regulation. Such genetic change represents a neglected and important impact of ocean acidification that may influence populations that show few outward signs of response to acidification. Our results demonstrate the capacity for rapid evolution in the face of ocean acidification and show that standing genetic variation could be a reservoir of resilience to climate change in this coastal upwelling ecosystem. However, effective response to strong natural selection demands large population sizes and may be limited in species impacted by other environmental stressors.","Adaptation; Environmental mosaic; Experimental evolution; Population genomics; RNA sequencing","carbon dioxide; acidification; allele; amino acid substitution; article; biomineralization; ecosystem; ecosystem resilience; evolution; experimental model; homeostasis; larval development; lipid metabolism; molecular dynamics; morphology; nonhuman; ocean acidification; priority journal; sea; Strongylocentrotus; Adaptation, Biological; Animals; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Evolution, Molecular; Genetic Variation; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Larva; Metagenomics; Seawater; Strongylocentrotus purpuratus; Echinoidea; Strongylocentrotus purpuratus",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus

We now investigate whether the speciation processes were driven by divergent natural selection in each genus by examining the extent of ecological and genetic divergence. We present new and extensive, ecological and genetic data for all three genera. Consistent with ecologically driven speciation, outlier loci were detected using genome scan methods. This mechanism is supported by individual-based analyses of genotype-environment correlations within species, demonstrating that local adaptation is currently widespread on the island. Genetic analyses show that prezygotic isolating barriers within species are currently insufficiently strong to allow further population differentiation. Interspecific hybridization was found in both Howea and Coprosma, and species distribution modelling indicates that competitive exclusion may result in selection against admixed individuals.

Comparison of closely related and geographically overlapping species can be particularly useful in cases where landscape may similarly influence genetic structure. Congruent patterns among species highlight the importance that landscape heterogeneity plays in determining genetic structure whereas contrasting patterns emphasize differences in species-specific ecology and life-history or the importance of species-specific adaptation to local environments. We examined the interacting roles of demography and adaptation in determining spatial genetic structure in two closely related and geographically overlapping species in a pristine environment. Using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci exhibiting both neutral and putative adaptive variation, we evaluated the genetic structure of sockeye salmon in the Copper River, Alaska; these data were compared to existing data for Chinook salmon from the same region. Overall, both species exhibited patterns of isolation by distance; the spatial distribution of populations largely determined the distribution of genetic variation across the landscape. Further, both species exhibited largely congruent patterns of within- and among-population genetic diversity, highlighting the role that landscape heterogeneity and historical processes play in determining spatial genetic structure. Potential adaptive differences among geographically proximate sockeye salmon populations were observed when high FST outlier SNPs were evaluated in a landscape genetics context.

In lakes on the Haida Gwaii archipelago (off western Canada), stickleback have undergone a remarkable local radiation and show phenotypic diversity matching that seen throughout the species distribution. To provide a historical context for this radiation, we surveyed genetic variation at >1000 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci in stickleback from over 100 populations. SNPs included markers evenly distributed throughout genome and candidate SNPs tagging adaptive genomic regions. Based on evenly distributed SNPs, the phylogeographic pattern differs substantially from the disjunct pattern previously observed between two highly divergent mtDNA lineages. The SNP tree instead shows extensive within watershed population clustering and different watersheds separated by short branches deep in the tree. These data are consistent with separate colonizations of most watersheds, despite underlying genetic connections between some independent drainages. This supports previous suppositions that morphological diversity observed between watersheds has been shaped independently, with populations exhibiting complete loss of lateral plates and giant size each occurring in several distinct clades. Throughout the archipelago, we see repeated selection of SNPs tagging candidate freshwater adaptive variants at several genomic regions differentiated between marine-freshwater populations on a global scale (e.g. EDA, Na/K ATPase). In estuarine sites, both marine and freshwater allelic variants were commonly detected. We also found typically marine alleles present in a few freshwater lakes, especially those with completely plated morphology.

Haustrum vinosum is a direct developing species, forming effectively closed populations, with the potential for local adaptation at local and regional scales. Here we show that populations of whelks east and west of a biogeographical barrier encounter different prey assemblages, and have different feeding patterns and apparent prey preferences. We then use a prey choice experiment to test for evidence that H.vinosum from three populations west of the barrier display an inherent preference for its most frequently encountered western prey species, the mussel Brachidontes rostratus (Dunker, 1857), over a novel prey, the barnacle Tesseropora rosea (Krauss, 1848).

Despite the demonstrated links between personality traits and dispersal behavior, most studies of local adaptation have focused on dispersal capacity through variation in morphology and physiology. Ephemeral habitat patches generally favor dispersal capacity, whereas loss and increasing isolation of the patches can select against dispersal capacity. In this study, we explore whether populations of Natterjack toads (Bufo calamita) have evolved different morphologies, physiological performance and personality traits in response to the spatial arrangement of their habitat. First, we studied the consistency and intercorrelations of behavioral traits in order to test for the possible existence of personality, which so far has been largely ignored in the study of amphibians. Second, we assessed levels of population differentiation in candidate personality traits and dispersal capacity. The toadlets in this study originated from populations with different degrees of isolation, due to distance from other populations and resistance of the surrounding landscape, and with different dynamics of the subpopulations. We used two cohorts of toadlets, one raised in a common environment and the other collected in the field. We found consistency and correlations between the behavioral measurements, suggesting the possible existence of personality linked to mobility. The higher locomotor performance in toadlets from the metapopulations in the low-resistance landscape compared with those from the isolated populations indicates local adaptation in dispersal capacity. Yet, we could not demonstrate that differences in behavior can be explained by local adaptation in dispersalrelated traits. © The Author 2012.","Behavioral syndrome; Bufo calamita; Dispersal capacity; Personality; Population differentiation","behavioral ecology; behavioral response; dispersal; isolated population; local adaptation; mobility; morphology; physiological response; population dynamics; subpopulation; toad; Amphibia; Animalia; Anura; Bufo; Bufo calamita",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus

We report a greater variation of shell shape in L.scabra compared to the slightly smaller variation in L.glabrata. This variation was probably associated with variation of environmental factors along the coast, such as temperature and hydrodynamics. Despite morphological variation, we found low mitochondrial genetic differentiation among samples from different localities for both species, which is probably a consequence of the ongoing gene flow during the free-swimming larval stage of these gastropods. Additionally, high levels of haplotype diversity, low nucleotide diversity, and 'star-like' genealogies were found in both species.

Overcoming this level of complexity requires an unbiased search for the evidence of selection in the genomes of populations sampled from their natural habitats and the identification of demographic processes that lead to present-day populations' genetic structure. Ecological model species with a suite of genomic tools and well-understood ecologies are best suited to resolve this complexity and elucidate the role of selective and demographic processes in the landscape genomic structure of natural populations.

Most evidence for local adaptation was found at range margins, with the strongest effects on reproductive output. Both biotic and abiotic factors affected performance, especially at range margins. Performance of most plants was best in the Scottish and Swedish common garden sites, in the core of the species' distribution. Despite adaptations at range margins, the performance of the species declines at distributional limits, with extreme southern populations looking particularly vulnerable. © 2012 The Authors.

The distribution patterns of European bat species differ between species. In this paper we seek to explain which life history traits, or interrelations between traits, can best explain observed differences in the distribution patterns of bats. Traits are interrelated and sometimes involve trade-offs, implying that a change in one trait may have positive or negative consequences for other traits. We describe the main morphological, physiological and ecological adaptations of insectivorous European bat species. We make pair-wise relations between traits, indicating the interrelations between traits, in terms of possible trade-offs.We relate the consequences of these trade-offs to the distribution maps of the species, focusing on the traits relevant for southern and northern distribution limits.We found coarse patterns that might indicate the distribution of related species are a consequence of their physiological, morphological and ecological adaptations and the interrelations between these adaptations. Hence, we think life-history strategies can be used to explain differences in species distribution.

The history of this approach is briefly reviewed. Strategies embracing the complementarity of genomics and specific-gene studies in evolution are considered. Implementation of these strategies, and examples showing their feasibility and power, are discussed. Initial generalizations emphasize: (1) reproducibility of adaptive mechanisms; (2) evolutionary co-importance of variation in protein sequences and expression; (3) refinement of rudimentary molecular functions as an origin of evolutionary innovations; (4) identification of specific-gene mechanisms as underpinnings of genomic or quantitative genetic variation; and (5) multiple forms of adaptive or constraining epistasis among genes.

We present a case-study from over 100years of data for the endemic landlocked Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar, Salmonidae) and brown trout (Salmo trutta, Salmonidae) in Lake Vänern, Sweden. We use this case-study to develop life history-based research and monitoring priorities for migratory salmonids. In Vänern, small wild populations of salmon and trout remain only in the heavily regulated Rivers Klar (Klarälven) and Gullspång (Gullspångsälven), and commercial and sport fisheries are maintained by hatchery stocking. These populations represent some of the last remaining large-bodied (up to 20kg) landlocked salmon stocks worldwide. We found that one of four stocks of wild fish has increased since 1996; the other three remain critically low. Hatchery return rates for three of four stocks appear stable at roughly 1% and annual fisheries catch is roughly 75metric tons, with an estimated 7.5% of hatchery smolts being recruited to the fishery; this also appears relatively stable since 1990. Our analysis reveals much uncertainty in key data requirements, including both river return and fisheries catch rates, estimates of wild smolt production and survival, and hatchery breeding and genetics protocols. These uncertainties, coupled with a lack of information on their riverine and lacustrine ecology, preclude effective management of these unique populations. We conclude with a framework for a life history-based approach to research and monitoring for Vänern salmon and trout, which should be applicable for all endemic, migratory salmonid populations. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Atlantic salmon; Brown trout; Life history-based management; Local adaptation; Salmonid conservation","anthropogenic effect; endemic species; fishery management; fishery production; habitat conservation; hatchery; life history; local adaptation; migratory population; smolt; survival; Lake Vanern; Sweden; Salmo salar; Salmo trutta; Salmonidae",Article,"",Scopus

These populations occur at the southern limits of anadromy for this species and could form the foundation of a restored anadromous metapopulation. We also tested for genetic introgression between these populations and the hatchery source that has been used to stock these sites. The overall FST for the natural populations at 12 microsatellite loci was 0.145 (95% confidence interval, 0.108-0.183), and D was 0.225 (0.208-0.243). On average, 94.6% of individuals were correctly assigned to the population where they were collected. Our results suggest that there is little gene flow even between geographically proximate populations. We found little evidence that repeated historic stocking from a known hatchery source has led to genetic introgression into these wild coastal brook trout populations. One hybrid individual appeared to be a backcross between an F1 and a hatchery individual. Another hybrid individual could not be classified. Our results suggest that nonintrogressed and potentially locally adapted populations of brook trout persist in several small coastal New England streams.

In several Mediterranean fish species, alternative migration patterns exist between individuals entering coastal lagoons that offer favourable conditions for growth and those staying in the sea where environmental conditions are less subject to rapid and stressful change. Whether these coexisting strategies are phenotypically plastic or include a role for local adaptation through differential survival needs to be determined. Here, we explore the genetic basis of alternate habitat use in western Mediterranean populations of the gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata). Samples from lagoonal and open-sea habitats were typed for three candidate gene microsatellite loci, seven anonymous microsatellites and 44 amplified fragment length polymorphism markers to test for genotype-environment associations. While anonymous markers globally indicated high levels of gene flow across geographic locations and habitats, non-neutral differentiation patterns correlated with habitat type were found at two candidate microsatellite loci located in the promoter region of the growth hormone and prolactin genes. Further analysis of these two genes revealed that a mechanism based on habitat choice alone could not explain the distribution of genotype frequencies at a regional scale, thus implying a role for differential survival between habitats. We also found an association between allele size and habitat type, which, in the light of previous studies, suggests that polymorphisms in the proximal promoter region could influence gene expression by modulating transcription factor binding, thus providing a potential explanatory link between genotype and growth phenotype in nature. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","gene flow; genotype-environment association; growth hormone; habitat choice; local adaptation; prolactin","microsatellite DNA; allele; amplified fragment length polymorphism; animal; article; DNA sequence; ecosystem; gene flow; gene frequency; genetic variability; genetics; genotype; genotype environment interaction; Mediterranean Sea; population genetics; promoter region; sea bream; Alleles; Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysis; Animals; Ecosystem; Gene Flow; Gene Frequency; Gene-Environment Interaction; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Genotype; Mediterranean Sea; Microsatellite Repeats; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Sea Bream; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Archosargus rhomboidalis; Sparus aurata",Article,"",Scopus

This is especially the case for marginal populations at their lowest elevation, as they are highly vulnerable. Adequate levels of genetic diversity are required for selection to take place, while high levels of altitudinal gene flow are seen as a major limiting factor potentially precluding local adaptation processes. Thus, a compromise between genetic diversity and gene flow seems necessary to guarantee persistence under oncoming conditions. It is therefore critical to determine if gene flow occurs preferentially between mountains at similar altitudinal belts, promoting local adaptation at the lowest populations, or conversely along altitude within each mountain.MethodsMicrosatellite markers were used to unravel genetic diversity and population structure, inbreeding and gene flow of populations at two nearby altitudinal gradients of Silene ciliata, a Mediterranean high-mountain cushion plant.Key ResultsGenetic diversity and inbreeding coefficients were similar in all populations. Substantial gene flow was found both along altitudinal gradients and horizontally within each elevation belt, although greater values were obtained along altitudinal gradients. Gene flow may be responsible for the homogeneous levels of genetic diversity found among populations. Bayesian cluster analyses also suggested that shifts along altitudinal gradients are the most plausible scenario.ConclusionsPast population shifts associated with glaciations and interglacial periods in temperate mountains may partially explain current distributions of genetic diversity and population structure. In spite of the predominance of gene flow along the altitudinal gradients, local genetic differentiation of one of the lower populations together with the detection of one outlier locus might support the existence of different selection forces at low altitudes. © 2012 The Author.","altitudinal range; Caryophyllaceae; Gene flow; genetic variation; glacial refuge; local adaptation; mountain plant; Silene ciliata","microsatellite DNA; altitude; altitudinal zonation; Bayesian analysis; cluster analysis; dicotyledon; gene flow; genetic differentiation; genetic marker; glacial-interglacial cycle; glaciation; global warming; inbreeding; island; isolated population; local adaptation; mountain region; population structure; refuge; adaptation; altitude; analysis of variance; article; Bayes theorem; climate change; gene flow; genetic variability; genetics; geography; inbreeding; physiology; population genetics; Silene; Southern Europe; Adaptation, Physiological; Altitude; Analysis of Variance; Bayes Theorem; Climate Change; Gene Flow; Genetic Structures; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Geography; Inbreeding; Mediterranean Region; Microsatellite Repeats; Silene; Mediterranean Region; Caryophyllaceae; Silene",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus

Neutral genetic variation is often assumed to reflect variation in quantitative traits under selection, though with even low neutral divergence there can be substantial differentiation in quantitative genetic variation associated with locally adapted phenotypes. To study the relative roles of natural selection and genetic drift in shaping phenotypic variation, the levels of quantitative divergence based on phenotypes (P ST) and neutral genetic divergence (F ST) can be compared. Such a comparison was made between 10 populations of Finnish House Sparrows (n = 238 individuals) collected in 2009 across the whole country. Phenotypic variation in tarsus-length, wing-length, bill-depth, bill-length and body mass were considered and 13 polymorphic microsatellite loci were analysed to quantify neutral genetic variation. Calculations of P ST were based on Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Bayesian estimates of phenotypic variances across and within populations. The robustness of the conclusions of the P ST-F ST comparison was evaluated by varying the proportion of variation due to additive genetic effects within and across populations. Our results suggest that body mass is under directional selection, whereas the divergence in other traits does not differ from neutral expectations. These findings suggest candidate traits for considering gene-based studies of local adaptation.

Evidence for local adaptation in herbivores with relatively broad host breadth is scarce, either because generalists rarely locally adapt or because fewer studies have tested for local adaptation. The marine isopod Idotea balthica, a small (<3 cm) generalist herbivore common to estuaries of the northwestern Atlantic, is found on multiple macroalgae and sea grasses north of 42°N, while more southerly populations utilize sea grass-dominated and macroalgal-poor habitats. Feeding preference assays revealed a latitudinal shift in preference hierarchy that mirrors this geographic variation in host availability. Northern populations have higher feeding preference for fresh and freeze-dried tissue of the brown macroalga Fucus vesiculosus and consumed more of its water-soluble and lipophilic extracts relative to southern populations. In contrast, southern populations have a relatively higher preference for the green macroalga Ulva linza and sea grass Zostera marina. The rank of hosts in feeding assays exhibited by northern adults (Fucus = Ulva > Zostera) and southern adults (Ulva > Fucus > Zostera) closely mirrored ranking of juvenile growth rates, suggesting that preference and performance are strongly correlated across these macrophytes. Several of our assays included isopods that had parents reared under uniform laboratory conditions, indicating that geographic differences are genetically mediated and unlikely to reflect phenotypic plasticity or maternal effects. Local adaptation in host use traits may be common in broadly distributed, generalist herbivores in marine and terrestrial systems, and will manifest itself as local shifts in the preference ranking of hosts. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Environmental heterogeneity; Fucus vesiculosus; Host use; Plant chemical defense; Plant herbivore interactions; Zostera marina","adult; bioassay; estuarine environment; feeding behavior; generalist; geographical variation; growth rate; herbivory; heterogeneity; isopod; juvenile; local adaptation; macroalga; performance assessment; phenotypic plasticity; plant extract; plant-herbivore interaction; population structure; preference behavior; seagrass; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Northwest); Fucus; Fucus vesiculosus; Idotea baltica; Isopoda; Poaceae; Ulva; Ulva linza; Zostera; Zostera marina",Article,"",Scopus

Their divergence from the lower-latitude brown bear provides a textbook example of rapid evolution of distinct phenotypes. However, limited mitochondrial and nuclear DNA evidence conflicts in the timing of PB origin as well as placement of the species within versus sister to the brown bear lineage. We gathered extensive genomic sequence data from contemporary polar, brown, and American black bear samples, in addition to a 130,000- to 110,000-y old PB, to examine this problem from a genome-wide perspective. Nuclear DNA markers reflect a species tree consistent with expectation, showing polar and brown bears to be sister species. However, for the enigmatic brown bears native to Alaska's Alexander Archipelago, we estimate that not only their mitochondrial genome, but also 5-10% of their nuclear genome, is most closely related to PBs, indicating ancient admixture between the two species. Explicit admixture analyses are consistent with ancient splits among PBs, brown bears and black bears that were later followed by occasional admixture. We also provide paleodemographic estimates that suggest bear evolution has tracked key climate events, and that PB in particular experienced a prolonged and dramatic decline in its effective population size during the last ca. 500,000 years. We demonstrate that brown bears and PBs have had sufficiently independent evolutionary histories over the last 4-5 million years to leave imprints in the PB nuclear genome that likely are associated with ecological adaptation to the Arctic environment.","Demographic history; Hybridization; Mammalian genomics; Phylogenetics","arctic climate; article; bear; black bear; brown bear; climate change; demography; evolution; gene sequence; genetic variability; genome; genomics; nonhuman; phenotype; phylogeny; polar bear; priority journal; United States; Adaptation, Biological; Animals; Arctic Regions; Base Sequence; Climate Change; Evolution, Molecular; Genetic Markers; Genetics, Population; Genome; History, Ancient; Molecular Sequence Data; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Species Specificity; Ursidae; Mammalia; Ursus americanus; Ursus arctos; Ursus maritimus",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus

Rather, neutral and adaptive markers provide different types of information that should be combined to make optimal management decisions.

For example, when energy resources influence offspring fitness (as in oviparous ectotherms), the egg and hatchling environments are expected to influence selection by acting on the amount of energy allocated to offspring. Here we identify population variation in egg mass, length, width, and volume from diamondback terrapin Malaclemys terrapin eggs collected in Rhode Island (RI), Maryland (MD), and South Carolina (SC). Egg size (mean volume: 7.6, 8.1, and 9.1 cc in RI, MD, and SC, respectively) and clutch size (mean no. eggs: 16.1, 12.2, and 6.0 in RI, MD, and SC, respectively) differed among populations, which indicated that females produce larger clutches with smaller eggs at high latitudes and smaller clutches of larger eggs at lower latitudes. Lipid analyses indicated that eggs from SC contained yolks with a higher proportion of nonpolar lipids than did eggs from MD or RI (mean percentage of nonpolar lipids: 22.3%, 22.5%, and 31.8% in RI, MD, and SC, respectively). Thus, female terrapins in SC are laying larger eggs with increased lipid content to provide more energy for the developing embryo. Interestingly, total triacylglycerol (energetic lipid) was greater in southern populations but occurred in higher proportions in northern populations (total triacylglycerol: 88.0%, 85.4%, and 81.9% in RI, MD, and SC, respectively). This variation in triacylglycerol levels demonstrates the necessity for quantifying each lipid component. These data indicate a difference in reproductive strategy by which females in northern populations invest in higher fecundity with less energetic resources per offspring, whereas females in southern populations invest in larger eggs with considerably greater energy reserves. © 2012 by The University of Chicago.",,"lipid; alcohol; clutch size; egg size; embryonic development; environmental conditions; fecundity; fitness; geographical variation; life history trait; lipid; local adaptation; parent-offspring interaction; population structure; resource allocation; turtle; animal; article; chemistry; female; gas chromatography; oocyte; physiology; reproduction; thin layer chromatography; turtle; United States; Animals; Chromatography, Thin Layer; Female; Flame Ionization; Lipids; Maryland; Ovum; Reproduction; Rhode Island; South Carolina; Turtles; Maryland; Rhode Island; South Carolina; United States; Emydidae; Malaclemys; Malaclemys terrapin",Article,"",Scopus

However, most clinal studies of climatic adaptation in Drosophila have involved species that contain cosmopolitan inversion polymorphisms that show clinal patterns themselves, making it difficult to determine whether the traits or inversions are under selection. Further, although climatic selection is unlikely to act on only one life stage in metamorphic organisms, a few studies have examined clinal patterns across life stages. Finally, clinal patterns of heat tolerance may also depend on the assay used. To unravel these potentially confounding effects on clinal patterns of thermal tolerance, we examined adult and larval heat tolerance traits in populations of Drosophila simulans from eastern Australia using static and dynamic (ramping 0.06 °C min-1) assays. We also used microsatellites markers to clarify whether demographic factors or selection are responsible for population differentiation along clines. Significant cubic clinal patterns were observed for adult static basal, hardened and dynamic heat knockdown time and static basal heat survival in larvae. In contrast, static, hardened larval heat survival increased linearly with latitude whereas no clinal association was found for larval ramping survival. Significant associations between adult and larval traits and climatic variables, and low population differentiation at microsatellite loci, suggest a role for climatic selection, rather than demographic processes, in generating these clinal patterns. Our results suggest that adaptation to thermal stress may be species and life-stage specific, complicating our efforts to understand the evolutionary responses to selection for increasing thermotolerance.

Rhagoletis cerasi L. (Diptera: Tephritidae) is a patchily distributed, stenophagous species of the temperate zone, and the geographical structure of its populations reveals substantial variation in gene flow rates across its distribution range. We studied the demographic components of R.cerasi adults from Greek and German populations by estimating the variability in fitness traits among allopatric populations, as well as among geographically discrete populations, with gene flow. Assuming that body size may exert a profound effect on adult fitness, both thorax and head sizes were considered as covariates in our analyses. Our data demonstrated that females were larger than males in all populations, and adult size varied significantly among populations within groups. Significant differences in a suite of life-history traits of R.cerasi adults were detected among populations with gene flow, whereas there were no consistent differences among allopatric populations. Therefore, the genetic differences among R.cerasi populations, driven mainly by geographical isolation, are poor predictors of variation in the life-history traits of adults. © 2012 The Linnean Society of London.","Allopatric populations; Body size; Demography; Divergent selection; Gene flow","adult; allopatry; body size; demography; divergence; fitness; fly; fruit; gene flow; geographical variation; life history trait; local adaptation; natural selection; patchiness; temperate environment",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus

However, their prevalence in more oceanic fishes, where extensive gene flow and reduced environmental selection may preclude local adaptation, remains unclear. If oceanic species lack genetic structure, they may be limited in their ability to adapt to global climate change. We examined the potential for adaptation in oceanic fishes by testing whether an oceanic silverside, the California grunion Leuresthes tenuis, displays CnGV in growth capacity and CoGV in vertebral number across a latitudinal gradient as found in estuarine silversides. Common garden experiments revealed that reaction norms for growth in response to temperature differed little among 3 L. tenuis populations from different latitudes. Growth rates of wild adult L. tenuis measured from scale analysis suggested that growth may be slightly faster at more southern latitudes, likely due to environmental variation. Mean vertebral number in wild L. tenuis, determined from radiographs, were nearly identical for all populations. Overall, our results did not provide evidence for spatial adaptations in these traits of L. tenuis, in contrast to the strong patterns of latitudinal trait adaptation in other, more estuarine silversides.

A series of five uplifted marine terraces along the northern coast of California represents one such system where morphologically distinct populations of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) are distributed across sharp soil gradients ranging from fertile soils near the coast to podzolic soils ca. 5 km inland. Methods: A total of 92 trees was sampled across four coastal marine terraces (N = 10-46 trees/terrace) located in Mendocino County, California and sequenced for a set of 24 candidate genes for growth and responses to various soil chemistry variables. Statistical analyses relying on patterns of nucleotide diversity were employed to identify genes whose diversity patterns were inconsistent with three null models. Key results: Most genes displayed patterns of nucleotide diversity that were consistent with null models (N = 19) or with the presence of paralogs (N = 3). Two genes, however, were exceptional: an aluminum responsive ABC-transporter with FST = 0.664 and an inorganic phosphate transporter characterized by divergent haplotypes segregating at intermediate frequencies in most populations. Conclusions: Spatially variable natural selection along gradients of aluminum and phosphate ion concentrations likely accounted for both outliers.

Its migrations have supported sustainable fisheries and impacted local cultures since antiquity, but its biogeographic range has contracted since the 1950s. Most recently, the species disappeared from the Black Sea in the late 1980s and has not yet recovered. Reasons for the Black Sea disappearance, and the species-wide range contraction, are unclear. However bluefin tuna formerly foraged and possibly spawned in the Black Sea. Loss of a locally-reproducing population would represent a decline in population richness, and an increase in species vulnerability to perturbations such as exploitation and environmental change. Here we identify the main genetic and phenotypic adaptations that the population must have (had) in order to reproduce successfully in the specific hydrographic (estuarine) conditions of the Black Sea. By comparing hydrographic conditions in spawning areas of the three species of bluefin tunas, and applying a mechanistic model of egg buoyancy and sinking rate, we show that reproduction in the Black Sea must have required specific adaptations of egg buoyancy, fertilisation and development for reproductive success. Such adaptations by local populations of marine fish species spawning in estuarine areas are common as is evident from a meta-analysis of egg buoyancy data from 16 species of fish. We conclude that these adaptations would have been necessary for successful local reproduction by bluefin tuna in the Black Sea, and that a locally-adapted reproducing population may have disappeared. Recovery of bluefin tuna in the Black Sea, either for spawning or foraging, will occur fastest if any remaining locally adapted individuals are allowed to survive, and by conservation and recovery of depleted Mediterranean populations which could through time re-establish local Black Sea spawning and foraging. © 2012 MacKenzie, Mariani.",,"Antiquity; article; biogeography; Black Sea; bluefin tuna; egg buoyancy; egg sinking; environmental change; environmental factor; estuary; evolutionary adaptation; fertilization; fishery; foraging; hydrography; local adaptation; nonhuman; physical parameters; plasticity; population distribution; population migration; reproductive success; spawning; species conservation; species richness; Thunnus thynnus; tuna; Animals; Feeding Behavior; Female; Male; Mediterranean Sea; Population Dynamics; Reproduction; Tuna; Scombridae; Thunnus thynnus",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Here, we explore these issues in the vase tunicate Ciona intestinalis (Ascidiacea: Enterogona: Cionidae), a model species complex, of which spA and spB are rapidly spreading worldwide. We intensively sampled 26 sites (N = 873) from both coasts of North America, and performed phylogenetic and population genetics analyses based on one mitochondrial fragment (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 3 -NADH dehydrogenase subunit I, COX3-ND1) and eight nuclear microsatellites. Our analyses revealed extremely complex genetic patterns in both species on both coasts. We detected a contrasting pattern based on the mitochondrial marker: two major genetic groups in C. intestinalis spA on the west coast versus no significant geographic structure in C. intestinalis spB on the east coast. For both species, geographically distant populations often showed high microsatellite-based genetic affinities whereas neighboring ones often did not. In addition, mitochondrial and nuclear markers provided largely inconsistent genetic patterns. Multiple factors, including random genetic drift associated with demographic changes, rapid selection due to strong local adaptation, and varying propensity for human-mediated propagule dispersal could be responsible for the observed genetic complexities. © 2012 The Authors.","Ciona intestinalis; Genetic complexity; Phylogeography; Population genetics; Selection/local adaptation; Solitary ascidian",,Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Here, we studied how different levels of perceived predation risk and competition during ontogeny affect the reaction norms of body size and growth in (i) marine and pond populations adapted to different levels of predation and competition and (ii) different sexes. We reared nine-spined stickleback in a factorial experiment under two levels of perceived predation risk (present/absent) and competition (high/low food supply). 3.We found divergence in the reaction norms at two levels: (i) predation-adapted marine stickleback had stronger reactions to predatory cues than intraspecific competition-adapted pond stickleback, the latter being more sensitive to available food than the marine fish and (ii) females reacting more strongly to the treatments than males. 4.The repeated, habitat-dependent nature of the differences suggests that natural selection is the agent behind the observed patterns.

With the tropical South China Sea inferred as the origin, the East China Sea-Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan clades in the north diverged successively from the ancestral clade during the mid-Pleistocene.

Many species have very distinct life history stages that may exhibit different responses to environmental factors. In this study we emphasized the critical role of the haploid microscopic stage (gametophyte) of the life cycle to explain the difference of edge distribution of two related kelp species. Lessonia nigrescens was recently identified as two cryptic species occurring in parapatry along the Chilean coast: one located north and the other south of a biogeographic boundary at latitude 29-30°S. Six life history traits from microscopic stages were identified and estimated under five treatments of temperature in eight locations distributed along the Chilean coast in order to (1) estimate the role of temperature in the present distribution of the two cryptic L. nigrescens species, (2) compare marginal populations to central populations of the two cryptic species. In addition, we created a periodic matrix model to estimate the population growth rate (λ) at the five temperature treatments. Differential tolerance to temperature was demonstrated between the two species, with the gametophytes of the Northern species being more tolerant to higher temperatures than gametophytes from the south. Second, the two species exhibited different life history strategies with a shorter haploid phase in the Northern species contrasted with considerable vegetative growth in the Southern species haploid stage. These results provide strong ecological evidence for the differentiation process of the two cryptic species and show local adaptation of the life cycle at the range limits of the distribution.

Samples were collected at four Atlantic locations, including Spain, Portugal, France and the South of Ireland, and genetically assayed using a suite of species-specific markers, including 15 putatively neutral microsatellites and 23 expressed sequence tag-linked markers, as well as a portion of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region. Two of the putatively neutral markers, Bld-10 and Ad-10, bore signatures of strong directional selection, particularly in the newly established Irish population, although the potential surfing effect of rare alleles at the edge of the expansion front was also considered. Analyses after the removal of these loci suggest low but significant population structure likely affected by some degree of gene flow counteracting random genetic drift. No signal of historic divergence was detected at mtDNA. BLAST searches conducted with all 38 markers used failed to identify specific genomic regions associated to adaptive functions.

Even with these new measures in place, public and scientific mistrust and lack of consistency has resulted in increased regulation of biocontrol introductions. This has likely decreased the probability of effective, sustainable control measures being expeditiously implemented. With the current apprehension concerning the safety of biocontrol, we should incorporate the processes (adaptation, selection, etc.) and theoretical concepts of evolutionary biology to predict and enhance the effectiveness of biocontrol.

Here, we discuss how and why spatial and evolutionary models should be implemented into future risk assessment analyses of potential biocontrol agents. We suggest that it is necessary to re-assess the approach that has developed over the past approximately 100 years of sustained releases and illuminate them in the context of an evolutionary timescale. © 2012 Association of Applied Biologists.","Biological control; biotype; Braconidae; evolution; habitat suitability model; local adaptation; meta-population; microevolution","biological control; efficiency measurement; evolutionary biology; gene flow; genetic drift; host selection; local adaptation; metapopulation; mutation; natural selection; nontarget organism; potential biocontrol agent; prediction; probability; risk assessment; wasp; Braconidae",Review,"",Scopus

We focused on exon 2 of the Dqa gene because it is highly variable in a large array of species and appears to evolve under pathogen-mediated selection in several rodent species. Using single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and sequencing techniques, 17 Dqa-exon2 alleles, belonging to at least two different copies of Dqa gene, were detected over the distribution range of M.glareolus. Evidence of selection was found using molecular and population analyses. At the molecular level, we detected 13 codons evolving under positive selection pressures, most of them corresponding to regions coding for putative antigen binding sites of the protein. At the European level, we compared patterns of population structure for the Dqa-exon2 and cytochrome b (cyt b) gene. We did not detect any spatial genetic structure among M.glareolus populations for the Dqa-exon2. These results strongly differed from those obtained using the cyt b gene, which indicated a recent phylogeographical history closely linked to the last glacial events. Seven mitochondrial lineages have yet been described, which correspond to major glacial refugia. Altogether, our results revealed clear evidence of balancing selection acting on Dqa-exon2 and maintaining polymorphism over large geographical areas despite M.glareolus history. It is thus likely that Mhc phylogeographical variability could have been shaped by local adaptation to pathogens. © 2012 The Linnean Society of London.","Balancing selection; Bank voles; Diversity; Immunogenetics; Molecular epidemiology; Puumala hantavirus; Zoonoses","allele; cytochrome; epidemiology; genetic structure; Last Glacial; local adaptation; molecular analysis; pathogen; phylogeography; polymorphism; population structure; protein; rodent; species diversity; virus; Europe; Clethrionomys glareolus; Cricetidae; Hantavirus; Muridae; Puumala virus; Rodentia",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus

These filters may include absolute attributes of the local environment and also how representative the local environment is of the surrounding region. The latter is consistent with a species-sorting perspective, in which regional species only occupy the local habitats to which they are adapted. Here we evaluate the relative effects of local environmental conditions, environmental representativeness, and environment-independent processes on the probability of local species occurrence, given their regional presence, of birds, mammals, and amphibians worldwide. In multipredictor models, environmental representativeness is a strong independent predictor of local species occurrence probability, with a relative contribution greater than that of absolute local environmental conditions. Furthermore, we find that local occurrence probability diminishes with increased regional richness independent of the local environment. This is consistent with reduced local occupancy in richer regions, which is a pattern that could stem from a largely neutral community assembly process. Our results support the importance of both environmentindependent and species-sorting processes and suggest that regional richness and environmental representativeness should be jointly used for understanding richness gradients across scales. © 2012 by The University of Chicago.","Biological inventories; Environmental similarity; Range maps; Regional enrichment; Scale; Species pool; Species richness; Terrestrial vertebrates","amphibian; bird; environmental conditions; indigenous population; local adaptation; mammal; probability; species inventory; species occurrence; species pool; species richness; Amphibia; animal; article; biodiversity; bird; environment; mammal; statistical model; Amphibians; Animals; Biodiversity; Birds; Environment; Linear Models; Mammals; Amphibia; Aves; Mammalia; Vertebrata",Article,"",Scopus

We measured the contribution of additive (V A) and maternal (V M) effects to the observed population differences for 17 life history and fitness-related traits. Our results show that, in general, maternal effects contribute more to phenotypic differences among populations than additive genetic effects.

We predict that fragmentation can reduce dispersal across such barrier-free landscapes because dispersal also is limited by a perception of risk. Considerable fragmentation has occurred in the Riding Mountain National Park (RMNP) region in Manitoba, Canada, during the past 60 years. We examine data from 13 autosomal microsatellites to determine whether fragmentation is correlated with genetic population structure in wolves (Canis lupus). Moderate and significant differentiation between RMNP and a genetic cluster identified 30 km farther north (F ST = 0.053, 95% CI [0.031-0.073]) is consistent with predicted effects of fragmentation. The RMNP population cluster represents at least seven wolf packs followed weekly by radio tracking during 2003-2006. Distinct mtDNA haplotypes have been identified in the Park and no successful wolf dispersal from RMNP has been documented in several multi-year tracking studies since 1974. Tracking data also indicate that some wolves might be reluctant to leave RMNP. Although the influence of behaviour and local adaptation require investigation, human-caused fragmentation appears to have caused cryptic genetic structure on fine spatiotemporal scales in a vagile species that is: (1) not influenced by physical movement barriers or historical ecological discontinuities in our study area, and; (2) able to live relatively close to humans. The Great Plains is now an intensely human-managed landscape.

Furthermore, we tested the relevance of habitat connectivity and spatial distribution of stress for the recovery of a local and total population. The simulation results indicated that population recovery is mainly driven by reproductive periods. Furthermore, high habitat connectivity led to faster recovery both for local and total populations. However, effects of landscape structure disappeared for homogeneously stressed populations, where local survivors increased recovery rate. Finally, local populations recovered faster, implying that assessing recovery in the field needs careful consideration of spatial scale for sampling.

Despite its broad latitudinal range, which results in populations living at widely different temperatures, multiple studies have concluded that this species is genetically homogenous. This may be due to high gene flow, which would inhibit local adaptation, and lack of strong post-settlement selection pressure, which would not favor shifts in allelic frequencies among sites. We investigated several physiological traits that show temperature-adaptive variation in other Mytilus species. We sampled populations of M. californianus at 7 sites across 33° of latitude to test for the possibility of local adaptation or phenotypic plasticity. Individuals acclimated to common conditions were examined for possible differences in whole-organism thermal tolerance. The most northern population (Tatoosh Island) had a significantly lower survival rate following an acute heat stress event than the other populations. Additional physiological processes were examined that affect thermal optima and limits: critical thermal maximum (Hcrit) of cardiac function and metabolic capacity (as indexed by tissue activity of an indicator enzyme, malate dehydrogenase). Tatoosh mussels had a significantly lower Hcrit than other sites, indicating that this population may be adapted to cooler conditions compared to other populations. Metabolic activity did not correlate with latitude of collection. Phenotypic plasticity at the adult stage did not explain differences in thermal tolerance. Thus, genetic differences (local adaptation or balanced polymorphism), developmental plasticity, maternal effects, or within-site thermal heterogeneity may be responsible for the observed variation among populations. © Inter-Research 2012.","Adaptation; Environmental variability; Latitudinal differences; Mytilus; Phenotypic plasticity; Physiology; Stress; Temperature","acclimation; allele; bivalve; developmental biology; environmental stress; enzyme activity; gene flow; homogeneity; intertidal environment; latitude; local adaptation; phenotypic plasticity; population structure; pressure effect; selection; temperature effect; tolerance; Alaska; Baja California [(STT) Mexico]; Mexico [North America]; Tatoosh Island; United States; Washington [United States]; Geukensia demissa; Mytilus; Mytilus californianus",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus

How animals and plants can adapt to these altered environments via contemporary evolution is thus of strong interest. We discuss how to use genetic monitoring to study adaptive responses via repeated analysis of the same populations over time, distinguishing between phenotypic and molecular genetics approaches. After describing monitoring designs, we develop explicit criteria for demonstrating adaptive responses, which include testing for selection and establishing clear links between genetic and environmental change. We then review a few exemplary studies that explore adaptive responses to climate change in Drosophila, selective responses to hunting and fishing, and contemporary evolution in Daphnia using resurrected resting eggs. We further review a broader set of 44 studies to assess how well they meet the proposed criteria, and conclude that only 23% fulfill all criteria. Approximately half (43%) of these studies failed to rule out the alternative hypothesis of replacement by a different, better-adapted population. Likewise, 34% of the studies based on phenotypic variation did not test for selection as opposed to drift. These shortcomings can be addressed via improved experimental designs and statistical testing. We foresee monitoring of adaptive responses as a future valuable tool in conservation biology, for identifying populations unable to evolve at sufficiently high rates and for identifying possible donor populations for genetic rescue. Technological advances will further augment the realization of this potential, especially next-generation sequencing technologies that allow for monitoring at the level of whole genomes. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","contemporary evolution; genetic monitoring; global change; historical DNA samples; population genomics; quantitative trait","adaptation; animal; Daphnia; Drosophila; environment; evolution; genetic variability; genetics; human; physiology; plant; review; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Biological Evolution; Daphnia; Drosophila; Environment; Genetic Variation; Humans; Plants; Animalia; Daphnia",Review,"",Scopus

In marine populations, generally characterised by large population sizes and high gene flow, the simultaneous use of multiple descriptors (i.e. genetic, morphological, life-history, etc.) can be particularly helpful in unravelling the often subtle and complex spatial patterns observed. The gastropod Buccinum undatum (common whelk) lacks a planktonic larval stage, which could promote isolation of local populations and lead to phenotypic divergence through genetic drift or local adaptation. Despite the commercial significance of this species, the relative importance of these 2 forces remains unknown. Here, we used microsatellites, geometric morphometrics and shell thickness measurements to investigate the evolutionary dynamics generating spatial variation in 10 whelk populations in coastal waters around Ireland. Genetic diversity was generally high and genetic structure moderate but significant (overall F ST = 0.019), in accordance with an isolation-by-distance pattern. Phenotypic divergence, as measured by PST, was uncorrelated with, and much more pronounced than, neutral divergence (F ST), indicating that environmental variation rather than population isolation drives phenotypic differentiation. For some traits, at least, diversifying selection is likely to be involved unless additive genetic components of phenotypic variation among populations are very low. Our results document a lack of correspondence between neutral and adaptive divergence, and highlight the need to couple connectivity estimates with the assessment of ecologically relevant traits in fisheries management and conservation. © 2012 Inter-Research.","Adaptation; Buccinum undatum; Gastropoda; Genetic drift; Geometric morphometrics; Microsatellites; PST","bivalve; coastal water; commercial species; connectivity; conservation management; dispersal; divergence; environmental gradient; evolutionary biology; fishery management; gastropod; gene flow; genetic drift; genetic marker; genetic structure; isolated population; local adaptation; morphometry; phenotypic plasticity; population size; spatial analysis; zooplankton; Ireland",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus

Physiological advantages achieved by partnering with functionally diverse symbionts have been assumed to be available only to corals that can form associations with multiple Symbiodinium types. Functional variation among populations of the same type of Symbiodinium has been overlooked, despite local adaptation being feasible because of large population sizes, genetic isolation and short asexual generation times. Here we demonstrate divergent thermal tolerance in a generalist Symbiodinium type from two different thermal environments. Symbiodinium from the warmer reef maintained greater photo-chemical performance and survivorship when exposed to an elevated temperature of 32°C, both in symbiosis and in culture. Juvenile corals associated with Symbiodinium from the warmer reef grew rapidly when exposed to 32°C, yet underwent bleaching and tissue death when associated with Symbiodinium from the cooler reef. These results demonstrate that Symbiodinium types can adapt to local differences in thermal climate and that this adaptation shapes the fitness of coral hosts. If Symbiodinium populations are able to further adapt to increases in temperature at the pace at which ocean climates warm, they may assist corals to increase their thermal tolerance and persist into the future. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Plants have evolved a suite of adaptive responses to cope with variable environmental conditions, but relatively little is known about which genes are involved in such responses. Here we studied molecular evolution on a genome-wide scale in two species of Cardamine with distinct habitat preferences: C. resedifolia, found at high altitudes, and C. impatiens, found at low altitudes. Our analyses focussed on genes that are involved in stress responses to two factors that differentiate the high- and low-altitude habitats, namely temperature and irradiation. Results: High-throughput sequencing was used to obtain gene sequences from C. resedifolia and C. impatiens. Using the available A. thaliana gene sequences and annotation, we identified nearly 3,000 triplets of putative orthologues, including genes involved in cold response, photosynthesis or in general stress responses. By comparing estimated rates of molecular substitution, codon usage, and gene expression in these species with those of Arabidopsis, we were able to evaluate the role of positive and relaxed selection in driving the evolution of Cardamine genes. Our analyses revealed a statistically significant higher rate of molecular substitution in C. resedifolia than in C. impatiens, compatible with more efficient positive selection in the former. Conversely, the genome-wide level of selective pressure is compatible with more relaxed selection in C. impatiens. Moreover, levels of selective pressure were heterogeneous between functional classes and between species, with cold responsive genes evolving particularly fast in C. resedifolia, but not in C. impatiens. Conclusions: Overall, our comparative genomic analyses revealed that differences in effective population size might contribute to the differences in the rate of protein evolution and in the levels of selective pressure between the C. impatiens and C. resedifolia lineages. The within-species analyses also revealed evolutionary patterns associated with habitat preference of two Cardamine species. We conclude that the selective pressures associated with the habitats typical of C. resedifolia may have caused the rapid evolution of genes involved in cold response. © 2012 Ometto et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","454 next generation sequencing; adaptive traits; Cardamine; habitat preference; Molecular evolution","adaptation; cold tolerance; dicotyledon; effective population size; environmental conditions; environmental stress; evolutionary biology; gene expression; genomics; habitat selection; molecular analysis; photosynthesis; protein; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Cardamine; Cardamine impatiens; Impatiens; vegetable protein; article; Cardamine; classification; codon; ecosystem; genetics; molecular evolution; phylogeny; physiology; Cardamine; Codon; Ecosystem; Evolution, Molecular; Phylogeny; Plant Proteins",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Here, we show that the thermal tolerances of green turtle (Chelonia mydas) embryos in a single, island-breeding population have diverged in response to the contrasting incubation temperatures of nesting beaches just a few kilometres apart. In natural nests and in a common-garden rearing experiment, the offspring of females nesting on a naturally hot (black sand) beach survived better and grewlarger at hot incubation temperatures comparedwith the offspring of females nesting on a cooler (pale sand) beach nearby. These differences were owing to shallower thermal reaction norms in the hot beach population, rather than shifts in thermal optima, and could not be explained by egg-mediated maternal effects.Our results suggest that marine turtle nesting behaviour can drive adaptive differentiation at remarkably fine spatial scales, and have important implications for how we define conservation units for protection. In particular, previous studies may have underestimated the extent of adaptive structuring in marine turtle populations that may significantly affect their capacity to respond to environmental change. © 2011 The Royal Society.","Climate change; Evolutionary significant unit; Local adaptation; Natal homing; Phenotypic plasticity; Population structure","breeding population; climate change; conservation planning; ecosystem response; ectothermy; embryo; endangered species; homing behavior; local adaptation; nesting behavior; phenotypic plasticity; philopatry; population structure; reproductive success; species conservation; survivorship; temperature effect; temperature tolerance; turtle; Animalia; Chelonia mydas; Cheloniidae; Testudines",Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus

The factors that promote larger ranges, such as broad niche widths and high dispersal abilities, could increase the likelihood of encountering new habitats but also prevent local adaptation due to high gene flow. Similarly, low dispersal abilities or narrower niche widths could cause populations to be isolated, but such populations may lack advantageous mutations due to low population sizes. Here we present a large-scale, spatially explicit, individual-based model addressing the relationships between species ranges, speciation, and extinction. We followed the evolutionary dynamics of hundreds of thousands of diploid individuals for 200,000 generations. Individuals adapted to multiple resources and formed ecological species in a multidimensional trait space. These species varied in niche widths, and we observed the coexistence of generalists and specialists on a few resources. Our model shows that species ranges correlate with dispersal abilities but do not change with the strength of fitness trade-offs; however, high dispersal abilities and low resource utilization costs, which favored broad niche widths, have a strong negative effect on speciation rates. An unexpected result of our model is the strong effect of underlying resource distributions on speciation: in highly fragmented landscapes, speciation rates are reduced. © 2011 by The University of Chicago.","Adaptive radiation; Coexistence; Fragmentation; Lognormal; Rare species; Trade-off","adaptive radiation; coexistence; dispersal; extinction; fitness; gene flow; generalist; habitat fragmentation; habitat selection; individual-based model; local adaptation; mutation; niche breadth; ploidy; range expansion; range size; rare species; resource allocation; resource use; specialist; speciation (biology); trade-off; adaptation; article; biological model; evolution; geography; population density; population dynamics; species differentiation; species extinction; Adaptation, Physiological; Biological Evolution; Extinction, Biological; Genetic Speciation; Geography; Models, Biological; Population Density; Population Dynamics",Article,"",Scopus

Mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA markers were used to study differentiation between the estuary and the ocean and the association between kinship and social group structure. Although multilocus analyses suggested that franciscanas are structured into 2 subpopulations (K = 2, divergence among clusters: FST = 0.06, P = 0.002; RST = 0.3, P = 0.001), mitochondrial markers did not support such divergence (FST = 0.02, P = 0.12; ST = 0.06, P =0.06). However, these units are not entirely segregated geographically. Regarding social structure, some groups are composed by first-order related individuals (R ≥ 0.5, P < 0.5). Overall, the data suggest that matrilines could be the social unit in this species. We argue that the divergence found could be associated to local adaptation and social structure, resulting from either feature leading to a recent divergence or reflecting equilibrium between local differentiation and gene flow.

The simulated impacts discussed in this study are based on regional projections of climate change generated by scientists at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, employing three climate models and two emissions scenarios used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The impacts are discussed in the context of significant regional growth expected during the period as well as an aging population base. Key issues explored in the report include potential inundation of six selected low-lying coastal areas in San Diego due to sea level rise, potential shortfalls in water deliveries, peak energy demand increases due to higher temperatures, growing risk of devastating wildfires, migrations of species in response to higher temperatures in an increasingly fragmented natural habitat, and public health issues associated with extreme temperature events. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Aging population; Changing climate; Climate change adaptation; Coastal area; Emissions scenarios; Extreme temperatures; Higher temperatures; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Local government; Natural habitat; Non profit organizations; Peak energy demand; Planning process; Population growth; Potential impacts; Private sectors; Public health; Public health issues; Public sector agencies; Regional climate; Regional levels; Research teams; San Diego; Scripps institution of oceanographies; Sea level rise; Water delivery; Biodiversity; Climate models; Coastal zones; Computer simulation; Ecosystems; Energy management; Health risks; Population statistics; Research; Sea level; Water supply; Climate change; aging population; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; high temperature; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; land use change; local government; nonprofit organization; population growth; public health; regional climate; sea level change; spatiotemporal analysis; wildfire; California; San Diego; United States",Article,"",Scopus

Temperature is strongly coupled to elevation and greatly affects life history traits of oviparous reptiles in mountain environments. Thus, species may encounter barriers for expanding their ranges if they are unable to adapt to the changing thermal conditions encountered along elevational gradients. We sought to determine whether thermal requirements for embryonic development provide a plausible explanation for elevational range limits of two species of lacertid lizards that have complementary elevational ranges in a Mediterranean mountain range (Psammodromus algirus is found at elevations below 1600 m and Iberolacerta cyreni is found at elevations above 1600 m). We combined experimental incubation of eggs in the laboratory with modelled estimates of nest temperature in the field. In both species, increasing temperature accelerated development and produced earlier hatching dates. The species associated with warmer environments (P. algirus) experienced an excessive hatching delay under the lowest incubation temperature. Moreover, newborns from eggs incubated at low temperatures showed poor body condition and very slow rates of postnatal growth. In contrast, eggs of the strictly alpine species I. cyreni exhibited shorter incubation periods than P. algirus that allowed hatching before the end of the active season even under low incubation temperatures. This was countered by lower reproductive success at higher temperatures, due to lower hatching rates and higher incidence of abnormal phenotypes. Elevational range limits of both species coincided well with threshold temperatures for deleterious effects on embryonic development. We suggest that incubation temperature is a major ecophysiological factor determining the elevational range limits of these oviparous lizards with predictable consequences for mountain distributions under future warmer climates. © 2011 The Authors.",,"alpine environment; body condition; climate change; climate effect; ecophysiology; elevation; embryonic development; evolutionary biology; hatching; high temperature; home range; incubation; life history trait; lizard; local adaptation; Mediterranean environment; mountain environment; oviparity; population distribution; reproductive success; temperature effect",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

Molecular genetic population studies over the whole ranges of such species as Atlantic herring and Atlantic cod showed a complex picture of spatial differentiation both on the macrogeographic and, in many areas, on the microgeographic scale, although the differentiation for neutral molecular markers was low. It was established that the migration activity of such fish is constrained in many areas of the species range by hydrological and physicochemical transition zones (environmental gradients), as well as gyres in the spawning regions. Natal homing was recorded in a number of marine fish species. Existing in marine fish constraints of gene migration and a very high variance of reproductive success determine a significantly smaller proportion of effective reproductive size of their populations in the total population size, which generates more complex abundance dynamics than assumed earlier. The various constraints on gene migration and natal homing in marine fish promote the formation of local adaptations at ecologically important phenotypic traits. Effects of selection underlying adaptations are actively investigated in marine fish on the genomic level, using approaches of population genomics. The knowledge of adaptive intraspecific structure enables understanding the ecological and evolutionary processes, that influence biodiversity and providing spatial frames for conservation of genetic resources under commercial exploitation.

Understanding dispersal mechanisms of these species is important to unravel their basic life history traits, biogeography, exchange of individuals between populations, and local adaptation. Soil-borne nematodes and root-feeding nematodes in particular occupy a key position in soil-food webs and can be determinants for plant growth and vegetation structure and succession. However, their dispersal abilities have been scarcely addressed, predominantly focusing on species of agricultural importance. Still, root-feeding nematodes are usually considered as being extremely limited and bound to the rhizosphere of plants. We investigated a mechanism for long distance dispersal of root-feeding nematodes associated to two widespread coastal dune grasses. The nematodes are known to be crucial for the functioning of these grasses. We experimentally tested the hypothesis that root-feeding nematodes are able to move across long distances inside rhizome fragments that are dispersed by seawater. We also tested the survival capacities of the host plants in seawater. Our study demonstrates that root-feeding nematodes and plants are able to survive immersion in seawater, providing a mechanism for long distance dispersal of root feeding nematodes together with their host plant. Drifting rhizome fragments enable the exchange of plant material and animals between dune systems. These results provide new insights to understand the ecology of dune vegetation, the interaction with soil-borne organisms and more importantly, re-set the scale of spatial dynamics of a group of organisms considered extremely constrained in its dispersal capacities. © 2011 The Authors.",,"agricultural practice; biogeography; dispersal; dune; experimental study; fragmentation; grass; growth; host plant; life history trait; local adaptation; nematode; population structure; rhizome; rhizosphere; seawater; soil microorganism; succession; vegetation structure; wave; Animalia; Nematoda; Poaceae",Article,"",Scopus

While it is becoming increasingly clear that population diversity can increase stability in species abundance, less is known about how population diversity can benefit consumers that can integrate across population diversity in their prey. Here we demonstrate cascading effects of thermal heterogeneity on trout-salmon interactions in streams where rainbow trout rely heavily on the seasonal availability of anadromous salmon eggs. Water temperature in an Alaskan stream varied spatially from 58C to 17.58C, and spawning sockeye salmon showed population differentiation associated with this thermal heterogeneity. Individuals that spawned early in cool regions of the 5 km long stream were genetically differentiated from those spawning in warmer regions later in the season. Sockeye salmon spawning generates a pulsed resource subsidy that supports the majority of seasonal growth in stream-dwelling rainbow trout. The spatial and temporal structuring of sockeye salmon spawn timing in our focal stream extended the duration of the pulsed subsidy compared to a thermally homogeneous stream with a single population of salmon. Further, rainbow trout adopted movement strategies that exploited the multiple pulses of egg subsidies in the thermally heterogeneous stream. Fish that moved to track the resource pulse grew at rates about 2.5 times higher than those that remained stationary or trout in the reference stream with a single seasonal pulse of eggs. Our results demonstrate that habitat heterogeneity can have important effects on the population diversity of dominant species, and in turn, influence their value to species that prey upon them. Therefore, habitat homogenization may have farther-reaching ecological effects than previously considered. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.","Alaska; Behavioral adaptation; Biocomplexity; Habitat heterogeneity; Habitat portfolio; Life history variation; Pacific salmon; Population diversity; Rainbow trout; USA; Water temperature","abundance; adaptive radiation; egg; genetic differentiation; habitat type; heterogeneity; homogeneity; integrated approach; intraspecific variation; local adaptation; population structure; resource use; salmonid; seasonality; spatiotemporal analysis; spawning; species diversity; stabilization; stream; temperature effect; water temperature; adaptation; animal; article; ecosystem; feeding behavior; physiology; rainbow trout; river; salmon; season; temperature; time; United States; Adaptation, Physiological; Alaska; Animals; Ecosystem; Feeding Behavior; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Rivers; Salmon; Seasons; Temperature; Time Factors; Alaska; United States; Oncorhynchus; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Oncorhynchus nerka; Salmonidae",Article,"",Scopus

To investigate nuclear microsatellites population structure in A. cerana, single workers of A. cerana colonies from Thailand were genotyped at 18 microsatellite loci. The loci showed intermediate to high levels of heterozygosity and a range of allele numbers. The analyses confirmed a fundamental subdivision of the Thai A. cerana population into the ""Asia Mainland"" and ""Sundaland"" regions at the Isthmus of Kra.

Overall, samples showed a weak isolation-by-distance effect. The isolated population on Samui island was most differentiated from the other samples. The results do not support our initial hypothesis of local host-pathogen co-evolution, which predicts a strict correspondence between the nuclear genome and the lineage of parasitic Varroa mite of the A. cerana samples, because the gene flow indicated by our nuclear microsatellite markers should also mix potential Varroa resistance alleles among subpopulations.

Here, we investigated the combined influences of major environmental features and stocking with non-native fish on the genetic structure and local adaptation of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) populations. We used 17 microsatellite loci to genotype 975 individuals originating from 34 French rivers. Bayesian analyses revealed a hierarchical genetic structure into five geographically distinct clusters. Coastal distance, geological substrate and river length were strong predictors of population structure. Gene flow was higher among rivers with similar geologies, suggesting local adaptation to geological substrate. The effect of river length was mainly owing to one highly differentiated population that has the farthest spawning grounds off the river mouth (up to 900 km) and the largest fish, suggesting local adaptation to river length. We detected high levels of admixture in stocked populations but also in neighbouring ones, implying large-scale impacts of stocking through dispersal of non-native individuals. However, we found relatively few admixed individuals suggesting a lower fitness of stocked fish and/or some reproductive isolation between wild and stocked individuals. When excluding stocked populations, genetic structure increased as did its correlation with environmental factors.

Sonneratia alba, a mangrove species widely distributed in the Indo-West Pacific, provides a very suitable system for the study of local adaptation. In this study, we analyzed DNA variation by pooling 71 genes from 85-100 individuals for DNA sequencing. For each of the two nearby S. alba populations, we obtained ∼2,500 × coverage on the Illumina GA platform and for the Sanya population, an additional 5,400 × coverage on the AB SOLiD platform. For the Sanya sample, although each sequencing method called many putative single nucleotide polymorphisms, the two sets of calls did not overlap, suggesting platform-dependent errors. Conventional sequencing corroborated that each population is monomorphic. The two populations differ by 54 bp of 79,000 sites, but 90% of the variants are found in 10% of the genes. Strong local adaptation and high migration may help to explain the extensive monomorphism shared by the two populations in the presence of a small number of highly differentiated loci. © The Author 2011.

Multiple ecologically and evolutionarily based definitions of population are in current use, which focus, respectively, on demographic and genetic interactions. Accurate population delimitation is crucial for not only evolutionary and ecological population biology, but also for conservation of threatened populations. Along the Pacific Coast of North America, two contrasting patterns of geographic variation in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) converge within the state of Oregon. Populations of these mice diverge morphologically across an east-west axis, and they diverge in mitochondrial DNA haplotypes across a north-south axis. In this study, we investigate these geographically contrasting patterns of differentiation in the context of ecological and evolutionary definitions (paradigms) of populations. We investigate these patterns using a new and geographically expansive sample that integrates data on morphology, mitochondrial DNA, and nuclear DNA. We found no evidence of nuclear genetic differentiation between the morphologically and mitochondrially distinct populations, thus indicating the occurrence of gene flowacross Oregon. Under the evolutionary paradigm, Oregon populations can be considered a single population, whereasmorphological and mitochondrial differentiations do not indicate distinct populations. In contrast, under the ecological paradigm morphological differentiation indicates distinct populations based on the low likelihood of demographic interactions between geographically distant individuals. The two sympatric but mitochondrially distinct haplogroups form a single population under the ecological paradigm. Hence, we find that the difference between evolutionary and ecological paradigms is the timescale of interest, and we believe that themore chronologically inclusive evolutionary paradigm may be preferable except in cases where only a single generation is of interest. © 2011 The Authors.","Gene flow; Genealogical discordance; Local adaptation; Peromyscus maniculatus; Population delimitation","Mus; Peromyscus; Peromyscus maniculatus",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Killifish (Fundulus sp.) have evolved both highly plastic and locally adapted phenotypes within different selective contexts, providing a comparative system in which to explore the genomic underpinnings of physiological plasticity and adaptive variation. Importantly, extensive variation exists among populations and species for tolerance to a variety of stressors, and we exploit this variation in comparative studies to yield insights into the genomic basis of evolved phenotypic variation. Notably, species of Fundulus occupy the continuum of osmotic habitats from freshwater to marine and populations within Fundulus heteroclitus span far greater variation in pollution tolerance than across all species of fish. Here, we explore how transcriptome regulation underpins extreme physiological plasticity on osmotic shock and how genomic and transcriptomic variation is associated with locally evolved pollution tolerance. We show that F. heteroclitus quickly acclimate to extreme osmotic shock by mounting a dramatic rapid transcriptomic response including an early crisis control phase followed by a tissue remodeling phase involving many regulatory pathways. We also show that convergent evolution of locally adapted pollution tolerance involves complex patterns of gene expression and genome sequence variation, which is confounded with body-weight dependence for some genes. Similarly, exploiting the natural phenotypic variation associated with other established and emerging model organisms is likely to greatly accelerate the pace of discovery of the genomic basis of phenotypic variation.

However, very few studies have combined spatial and temporal sampling to investigate adaptive genetic structuring at local and microgeographical scales, i.e. scales at which neutral genetic markers have typically revealed very limited levels of population structure. In the present study we analyzed 92 gene-associated single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in Atlantic cod Gadus morhua from several sampling sites within the North Sea and adjacent areas. To test for temporal stability, we included long- and short-term (i.e. from 24 to 38 and from 8 to 11 yr, respectively) temporally replicated samples from a subset of populations. As expected, we found very low levels of neutral genetic population structure (FST = 0.003). Three specific loci, however, showed highly elevated levels of genetic differentiation. Interestingly, these loci were identical to loci previously found to display signals of adaptive evolution on larger spatial scales. Analysis of historical samples revealed long-term temporally stable patterns of both neutral and adaptive divergence between some populations, indicating long-term temporal adaptive stability driven by strong local selection. In an environmentally dynamic area, on the other hand, patterns of genetic structuring were more variable. Overall, our results not only suggest separation of populations under both evolutionary and ecological paradigms, but also illustrate the usefulness of the spatio-temporal approach for making inferences about the dynamics and geographical distribution of adaptive genetic variation in natural populations. © 2011 Inter-Research.","Adaptive genetic variation; Atlantic cod; Local selection; Single nucleotide polymorphism; SNPs","adaptation; gadoid; genetic differentiation; genetic marker; geographical distribution; polymorphism; population structure; sampling; spatiotemporal analysis; Atlantic Ocean; North Sea; Gadus morhua; Pisces",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus

As such, measuring Qst in relation to neutral differentiation presents a first-line investigation applicable in evolutionary biology (selection on functional genes) and conservation biology (identification of locally adapted coding genes). However, many species, especially those in need of conservation actions, are not amenable for the kind of breeding design required to estimate either narrow- or broad-sense Qst. In such cases, Qst has been approximated by the phenotypic divergence in a trait across populations (Pst). I here argue that the critical aspect for how well Pst approximates Qst depends on the extent that additive genetic effects determine variation between populations relative to within populations. I review how the sensitivity of conclusions regarding local adaptation based on Pst have been evaluated in the literature and find that many studies make a anticonservative null assumption in estimating Pst and/or use a nonconservative approach to explore sensitivity of their conclusions. Data from two studies that have provided a second, independent assessment of selection in their system suggest that Pst-Fst comparisons should be interpreted very conservatively.

Often this differentiation coincides in space with contrasts in ecological factors, forming a genetic-environment association (GEA). GEAs imply a role for local adaptation, and so it is tempting to conclude that the strongly differentiated markers are themselves under ecologically based divergent selection, or are closely linked to loci under such selection. Here, we highlight an alternative and neglected explanation: intrinsic (i.e. environment-independent) pre- or post-zygotic genetic incompatibilities rather than local adaptation can be responsible for increased differentiation. Intrinsic genetic incompatibilities create endogenous barriers to gene flow, also known as tension zones, whose location can shift over time. However, tension zones have a tendency to become trapped by, and therefore to coincide with, exogenous barriers due to ecological selection. This coupling of endogenous and exogenous barriers can occur easily in spatially subdivided populations, even if the loci involved are unlinked. The result is that local adaptation explains where genetic breaks are positioned, but not necessarily their existence, which can be best explained by endogenous incompatibilities. More precisely, we show that (i) the coupling of endogenous and exogenous barriers can easily occur even when ecological selection is weak; (ii) when environmental heterogeneity is fine-grained, GEAs can emerge at incompatibility loci, but only locally, in places where habitats and gene pools are sufficiently intermingled to maintain linkage disequilibria between genetic incompatibilities, local-adaptation genes and neutral loci. Furthermore, the association between the locally adapted and intrinsically incompatible alleles (i.e. the sign of linkage disequilibrium between endogenous and exogenous loci) is arbitrary and can form in either direction. Reviewing results from the literature, we find that many predictions of our model are supported, including endogenous genetic barriers that coincide with environmental boundaries, local GEA in mosaic hybrid zones, and inverted or modified GEAs at distant locations. We argue that endogenous genetic barriers are often more likely than local adaptation to explain the majority of Fst-outlying loci observed in genome scan approaches - even when these are correlated to environmental variables. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","ecological speciation; endogenous barrier; Fst outliers; genetic incompatibilities; genetic-environment association; genome scan; hybrid zone; local adaptation","adaptation; animal; ecology; ecosystem; gene flow; population genetics; review; species differentiation; theoretical model; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Ecology; Ecosystem; Gene Flow; Genetic Speciation; Genetics, Population; Models, Theoretical",Review,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus

Discrimination between populations within these three regions also had a high degree of correct classification (89·0-95·8%).

Fish from the southern rivers had a deeper body form whereas fish from the middle region had larger heads and pectoral fins.

To fully understand the genetic mechanisms behind this process, the phylogeographic history of the species (inferred from neutral markers) as well as the loci under selection need to be known. Here we sequenced an intron in the arginine kinase gene (Ark), which shows strong clinal variation between two locally adapted ecotypes of the flat periwinkle, Littorina fabalis. The small-sheltered ecotype was almost fixed for one haplotype, H1, in populations on both sides of the North Sea, unlike the large-moderately exposed ecotype, which segregated for ten different haplotypes. This contrasts with neutral markers, where the two ecotypes are equally variable. H1 could have been driven to high frequency in an ancestral population and then repeatedly spread to sheltered habitats due to local selection pressures with the colonization of both sides of the North Sea, after the last glacial maximum (18 000 years ago). An alternative explanation is that a positively selected mutation, in or linked to Ark, arose after the range expansion and secondarily spread through sheltered populations throughout the distribution range, causing this ecotype to evolve in a concerted fashion. Also, we were able to sequence up to four haplotypes consistently from some individuals, suggesting a gene duplication in Ark. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved 0018-067X/11.","concerted ecotype evolution; intron; Littorina spp.; local adaptation; parallel evolution; selective sweep","arginine kinase; isoenzyme; primer DNA; colonization; ecotype; enzyme activity; frequency analysis; gene expression; gene flow; habitat type; intertidal environment; local adaptation; mutation; phylogeography; population distribution; population structure; range expansion; selection; snail; animal; article; DNA sequence; ecosystem; enzymology; gene duplication; gene flow; genetic selection; genetic variability; genetics; haplotype; intron; molecular genetics; Norway; nucleotide sequence; sequence alignment; snail; species difference; Sweden; United Kingdom; Animals; Arginine Kinase; Base Sequence; DNA Primers; Ecosystem; England; Gene Duplication; Gene Flow; Genetic Variation; Haplotypes; Introns; Isoenzymes; Molecular Sequence Data; Norway; Selection, Genetic; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Snails; Species Specificity; Sweden; Atlantic Ocean; North Sea; Catharanthus roseus; Gastropoda; Littorina; Littorina fabalis",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus

The identification of genomic polymorphisms that account for adaptive variation can aid in finding candidate loci for local adaptation. Consequently, a comparison of spatial patterns in neutral markers and loci under selection may help disentangle the effects of gene flow, genetic drift and selection at the landscape scale. Many amphibians breed in wetlands, which differ in environmental conditions and in the degree of isolation, enhancing the potential for local adaptation. We used microsatellite markers to measure genetic differentiation among 17 local populations of Rana arvalis breeding in a network of wetlands. We found that locus RC08604 deviated from neutral expectations, suggesting that it is a good candidate for directional selection. We used a genetic network analysis to show that the allele distribution in this locus is correlated with habitat characteristics, whereas this was not the case at neutral markers that displayed a different allele distribution and population network in the study area. The graph approach illustrated the genomic heterogeneity (neutral loci vs. the candidate locus for directional selection) of gene exchange and genetic divergence among populations under directional selection. Limited gene flow between wetlands was only observed at the candidate genomic region under directional selection. RC08604 is partially located inside an up-regulated thyroid-hormone receptor (TRβ) gene coordinating the expression of other genes during metamorphosis and appears to be linked with variation in larval life-history traits found among R. arvalis populations. We suggest that directional selection on genes coding larval life-history traits is strong enough to maintain the divergence in these genomic regions, reducing the effective recombination of locally adapted alleles but not in other regions of the genome. Integrating this knowledge into conservation plans at the landscape scale will improve the design of management strategies to preserve adaptive genetic diversity in wetland networks. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","conservation units; directional selection; habitat heterogeneity; local adaptation; population structure; stabilizing selection","fresh water; microsatellite DNA; adaptation; allele; animal; article; biological model; ecosystem; frog; gene flow; gene frequency; gene regulatory network; genetic selection; genetic variability; genetics; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; population genetics; Sweden; Adaptation, Biological; Alleles; Animals; Ecosystem; Fresh Water; Gene Flow; Gene Frequency; Gene Regulatory Networks; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Microsatellite Repeats; Models, Genetic; Molecular Sequence Data; Ranidae; Selection, Genetic; Sweden; Amphibia; Rana arvalis",Article,"",Scopus

Using two genome scan methods based on the analysis of population differentiation, we found a set of 28 outlier loci that departed from the neutral expectation in one or the other method (of which a subset of 14 loci were common to both methods), which showed a significantly increased differentiation between O. nubilalis and O. scapulalis, when compared to the rest of the genome. A subset of 12 outlier loci were sequenced, of which 7 were successfully re-amplified as target candidate loci. Three of these showed homology with annotated lepidopteran sequences from public nucleotide databases. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","adaptive divergence; AFLP; host-plant specialization; Ostrinia spp.; population genomics","adaptation; amplified fragment length polymorphism; animal; Artemisia; article; cluster analysis; DNA sequence; genetic marker; genetics; genome; host parasite interaction; Humulus; maize; moth; parasitology; species difference; Adaptation, Physiological; Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysis; Animals; Artemisia; Cluster Analysis; Genetic Markers; Genome, Insect; Host-Parasite Interactions; Humulus; Moths; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Species Specificity; Zea mays; Artemisia vulgaris; Ostrinia; Ostrinia nubilalis; Ostrinia scapulalis; Zea mays",Article,"",Scopus

Yet, similar intraspecific studies are rare, despite the fact that they could better determine how selection and phenotypic plasticity influence brain architecture. We investigated the variation in brain size and structure in wild-caught nine-spined sticklebacks (Pungitius pungitius) from eight populations, representing marine, lake, and pond habitats, and compared them to data from a previous common garden study from a smaller number of populations. Results: Brain size scaled hypo-allometrically with body size, irrespective of population origin, with a common slope of 0.5. Both absolute and relative brain size, as well as relative telencephalon, optic tectum and cerebellum size, differed significantly among the populations. Further, absolute and relative brain sizes were larger in pond than in marine populations, while the telencephalon tended to be larger in marine than in pond populations. These findings are partly incongruent with previous common garden results. A direct comparison between wild and common garden fish from the same populations revealed a habitat-specific effect: pond fish had relatively smaller brains in a controlled environment than in the wild, while marine fish were similar. All brain parts were smaller in the laboratory than in the wild, irrespective of population origin. Conclusion: Our results indicate that variation among populations is large, both in terms of brain size and in the size of separate brain parts in wild nine-spined sticklebacks. However, the incongruence between the wild and common garden patterns suggests that much of the population variation found in the wild may be attributable to environmentally induced phenotypic plasticity. Given that the brain is among the most plastic organs in general, the results emphasize the view that common garden data are required to draw firm evolutionary conclusions from patterns of brain size variability in the wild. © 2011 Gonda et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"allometry; body size; brain; fish; functional morphology; habitat type; interspecific variation; intraspecific variation; laboratory method; life history trait; local adaptation; marine environment; phenotypic plasticity; pond; population structure; wild population; Pungitius pungitius; animal; article; brain; ecosystem; evolution; genetics; histology; organ size; physiology; Smegmamorpha; Animals; Biological Evolution; Brain; Ecosystem; Organ Size; Smegmamorpha",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

However, gene flow may also lead to the evolution of phenotypic plasticity. We investigated the effect of gene flow on local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity in development time in island populations of the common frog Rana temporaria which breed in pools that differ in drying regimes. This was done by investigating associations between traits (measured in a common garden experiment) and selective factors (pool drying regimes and gene flow from other populations inhabiting different environments) by regression analyses and by comparing pairwise FST values (obtained from microsatellite analyses) with pairwise QST values. We found that the degree of phenotypic plasticity was positively correlated with gene flow from other populations inhabiting different environments (among-island environmental heterogeneity), as well as with local environmental heterogeneity within each population. Furthermore, local adaptation, manifested in the correlation between development time and the degree of pool drying on the islands, appears to have been caused by divergent selection pressures. The local adaptation in development time and phenotypic plasticity is quite remarkable, because the populations are young (less than 300 generations) and substantial gene flow is present among islands. © 2010 The Author(s).

Yet, little is known about the geographical scale of local adaptation. Is adaptive divergence primarily evident at the scale of regions or individual populations? Also, many salmonid populations are subject to spawning intrusion by farmed conspecifics that experience selection regimes fundamentally different from wild populations. This prompts the question if adaptive differences between wild populations and hatchery strains are more pronounced than between different wild populations? We addressed these issues by analyzing variation at 74 microsatellite loci (including anonymous and expressed sequence tag- and quantitative trait locus-linked markers) in 15 anadromous wild brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) populations, representing five geographical regions, along with two lake populations and two hatchery strains used for stocking some of the populations. FST-based outlier tests revealed more outlier loci between different geographical regions separated by 522±228 km (mean±s.d.) than between populations within regions separated by 117±79 km (mean±s.d.). A significant association between geographical distance and number of outliers between regions was evident. There was no evidence for more outliers in comparisons involving hatchery trout, but the loci under putative selection generally were not the same as those found to be outliers between wild populations. Our study supports the notion of local adaption being increasingly important at the scale of regions as compared with individual populations, and suggests that loci involved in adaptation to captive environments are not necessarily the same as those involved in adaptive divergence among wild populations. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.","Adaptive divergence; Genome scan; Landscape genomics; Salmonid fishes; Selection; Stocking","microsatellite DNA; genetic marker; genome; hatchery; local adaptation; natural selection; salmonid; spawning; wild population; adaptation; allele; animal; article; genetic selection; genetic variability; genetics; molecular typing; population genetics; trout; Adaptation, Physiological; Alleles; Animals; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Microsatellite Repeats; Molecular Typing; Selection, Genetic; Trout; Pisces; Salmo trutta; Salmonidae",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus

Studies of phenotypic variation have shown that interbreeding between farmed and wild salmon may lead to loss of local adaptation. Yet, few studies have attempted to assess the impact of interbreeding at the genome level, especially among North American populations. Here, we document temporal changes in the genetic makeup of the severely threatened Magaguadavic River salmon population (Bay of Fundy, Canada), a population that might have been impacted by interbreeding with farmed salmon for nearly 20 years. Wild and farmed individuals caught entering the river from 1980 to 2005 were genotyped at 112 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and/or eight microsatellite loci, to scan for potential shifts in adaptive genetic variation. No significant temporal change in microsatellite-based estimates of allele richness or gene diversity was detected in the wild population, despite its precipitous decline in numbers over the last two decades. This might reflect the effect of introgression from farmed salmon, which was corroborated by temporal change in linkage-disequilibrium. Moreover, SNP genome scans identified a temporal decrease in candidate loci potentially under directional selection. Of particular interest was a SNP previously shown to be strongly associated with an important quantitative trait locus for parr mark number, which retained its genetic distinctiveness between farmed and wild fish longer than other outliers. Overall, these results indicate that farmed escapees have introgressed with wild Magaguadavic salmon resulting in significant alteration of the genetic integrity of the native population, including possible loss of adaptation to wild conditions. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.","Conservation; Farm escapees; Genome scan; Introgression; Local adaptation; SNP","microsatellite DNA; escape behavior; genetic differentiation; genetic marker; genome; introgression; local adaptation; phenotypic plasticity; salmonid; wild population; adaptation; animal; article; Atlantic salmon; food industry; gene linkage disequilibrium; genetic selection; genetic variability; genetics; population dynamics; population genetics; single nucleotide polymorphism; time; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Fisheries; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Linkage Disequilibrium; Microsatellite Repeats; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Population Dynamics; Salmo salar; Selection, Genetic; Time Factors; Canada; Magaguadavic River; New Brunswick; Salmo salar",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus

In a speciespoor environment like the Baltic Sea this is particularly critical as major ecosystem functions may be upheld by single species. A complex interplay between demographic and genetic characteristics of species and populations determines risks of local extinction, chances of re-establishment of lost populations, and tolerance to environmental changes by evolution of new adaptations. Recent studies show that Baltic populations of dominant marine species are locally adapted, have lost genetic variation and are relatively isolated. In addition, some have evolved unusually high degrees of clonality and others are representatives of endemic (unique) evolutionary lineages. We here suggest that a consequence of local adaptation, isolation and genetic endemism is an increased risk of failure in restoring extinct Baltic populations. Additionally, restricted availability of genetic variation owing to lost variation and isolation may negatively impact the potential for evolutionary rescue following environmental change. © Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2011.","Biocomplexity; Endemic lineages Evolution of tolerance to contamination; Genetic variation; Marginal environment","ecosystem function; endemism; evolutionary biology; future prospect; genetic variation; local adaptation; local extinction; marginal sea; phylogenetics; survival; adaptation; animal; article; Baltic States; evolution; genetic selection; genetic variability; population dynamics; sea; species extinction; water pollutant; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Baltic States; Biological Evolution; Extinction, Biological; Genetic Variation; Oceans and Seas; Population Dynamics; Selection, Genetic; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

Less than 1200 individuals remain, and the species is declining at a rate of approximately 4% per year as a result of juvenile starvation, shark predation, and entanglement in marine debris. Some of these problems may be alleviated by translocation; however, if island breeding aggregates are effectively isolated subpopulations, moving individuals may disrupt local adaptations. In these circumstances, managers must balance the pragmatic need of increasing survival with theoretical concerns about genetic viability. To assess range-wide population structure of the Hawaiian monk seal, we examined an unprecedented, near-complete genetic inventory of the species (n =1897 seals, sampled over 14 years) at 18 microsatellite loci. Genetic variation was not spatially partitioned (w=-0.03, p = 1.0), and a Bayesian clustering method provided evidence of one panmictic population (K =1). Pairwise FSTcomparisons (among 7 island aggregates over 14 annual cohorts) did not reveal temporally stable, spatial reproductive isolation.

Metabolic theory of ecology and experimental studies at the cross-species level suggest the existence of general patterns linking natural mortality to body mass and temperature. However, there is scant evidence that similar relationships also hold at the intra-specific scale, possibly because of the relatively narrow range of sizes and temperatures experienced by most species and the effect of local adaptation, which can obscure links between temperature and vital rates. In this sense, the European eel Anguilla anguilla, a panmictic species with a wide distribution range, provides a paradigmatic case. We compiled data published in the past 30 years on eel mortality during the continental phase of the life cycle for 15 eel stocks and calibrated a general model for mortality, considering the effects of body mass, temperature, stock density and gender. Estimated activation energy (E = 1.2 eV) was at the upper extreme reported for metabolic reactions. Estimated mortality rates (ranging between 0.02 year-1 at 8°C, low density and 0.47 year-1 at 18°C, high density for a body mass of 100 g) were appreciably lower than those of most fishes, most likely due to the exceptionally low energy-consuming metabolism of eel. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Allometric theory; Anguilla anguilla; Density-dependent survival; Life history variation; Temperature scaling of vital rates","activation energy; allometry; body mass; density dependence; eel; geographical distribution; intraspecific interaction; life cycle; life history trait; local adaptation; metabolism; mortality; temperature effect; adaptation; animal; article; biological model; body weight; eel; energy metabolism; growth, development and aging; metabolism; mortality; population density; temperature; time; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Body Weight; Eels; Energy Metabolism; Models, Biological; Mortality; Population Density; Temperature; Time Factors; Anguilla anguilla; Pisces",Article,"",Scopus

In contrast to all other components of this signal transduction pathway, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) evolved in various structural families, eventually comprising hundreds of members in vertebrate genomes. Their functional diversity is in contrast to the conserved transmembrane core and the invariant set of intracellular signaling mechanisms, and it may be the interplay of these properties that is the key to the evolutionary success of GPCR. The GPCR repertoires retrieved from extant vertebrate genomes are the recent endpoints of this long evolutionary process. But the shaping of the fine structure and the repertoire of GPCR is still ongoing, and signatures of recent selection acting on GPCR genes can be made visible by modern population genetic methods.

Those defensive responses, however, were not activated against a highly damaging invasive predator (red swamp crayfish). Induced defences increased tadpole survival when faced against either indigenous dragonflies or invasive crayfish, so its inactivation in the presence of the invasive predator seems to be due to failure in cue recognition. Furthermore, we tested for local adaptation to the invasive predator by comparing individuals from ponds either exposed to or free from crayfish. In both cases, tadpoles failed to express inducible defences against crayfish, indicating that ca 30 years of contact with the invasive species (roughly 10-15 frog generations) have been insufficient for the evolution of recognition of invasive predator cues. © 2011 The Royal Society.","Anti-predator defences; Biological invasions; Cue recognition; Dragonflies; Phenotypic plasticity; Red swamp crayfish","antipredator defense; biological invasion; chemical cue; crayfish; dragonfly; extinction; frog; invasive species; local adaptation; morphology; native species; phenotypic plasticity; population decline; Anisoptera (dragonflies); Anura; Astacoidea; Procambarus clarkii; Rana clamitans",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus

Specifically, we use adaptive ecological divergence (here, population divergence in host plant use and preference) as a proxy for selection strength and evaluate the correlation between levels of adaptive and genetic differentiation across pairwise population comparisons. Positive correlations would reveal the pattern predicted by our hypothesis, that of ‘isolation by adaptation’ (IBA). Notably, IBA is predicted not only for selected loci but also for neutral loci. This may reflect the effects of divergent selection on neutral loci that are ‘loosely linked’ to divergently selected loci or on geneflow restriction that facilitates genetic drift at all loci, including neutral loci that are completely unlinked to those evolving under divergent selection. Here, we evaluate IBA in maple-and willow-associated populations of Neochlamisus bebbianae leaf beetles. To do so, we collected host preference data to construct adaptive divergence indices and used AFLPs (amplified fragment length polymorphisms) and mitochondrial sequences to quantify genetic differentiation. Partial Mantel tests showed significant IBA in ‘pooled’ analyses of putatively neutral and of putatively selected (‘outlier’) AFLP loci. This pattern was also recovered in 12% of ‘locus-specific’ analyses that separately evaluated genetic differentiation at individual neutral loci. These results provided evidence for widespread effects of selection on neutral genomic divergence.

This review presents and discusses progress and pitfalls of applying gene expression analyses to fishes and suggests simple frameworks to get started with gene expression analysis. It is emphasized that well-planned gene expression studies can serve as an important tool for the identification of selection in local populations of fishes, even for non-traditional model species where limited genomic information is available.

We show that widespread hybridization has occurred between two neo-tropical stream fishes with partial reproductive isolation. Phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial sequence data showed that the swordtail fish Xiphophorus birchmanni is monophyletic and that X. malinche is part of an independent monophyletic clade with other species. Using informative single nucleotide polymorphisms in one mitochondrial and three nuclear intron loci, we genotyped 776 specimens collected from twenty-three sites along seven separate stream reaches. Hybrid zones occurred in replicated fashion in all stream reaches along a gradient from high to low elevation. Genotyping revealed substantial variation in parental and hybrid frequencies among localities. Tests of F IS and linkage disequilibrium (LD) revealed generally low F IS and LD except in five populations where both parental species and hybrids were found suggesting incomplete reproductive isolation. In these locations, heterozygote deficiency and LD were high, which suggests either selection against early generation hybrids or assortative mating. These data lay the foundation to study the adaptive basis of the replicated hybrid zone structure and for future integration of behaviour and genetics to determine the processes that lead to the population genetic patterns observed in these hybrid zones. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","elevational gradient; introgression; linkage disequilibrium; local adaptation; Poeciliidae; population genetics","mitochondrial DNA; animal; article; classification; Cyprinodontiformes; DNA sequence; evolution; female; gene linkage disequilibrium; genetic variability; genetics; genotype; geography; hybridization; male; Mexico; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; physiology; reproduction; single nucleotide polymorphism; species differentiation; Animals; Base Sequence; Biological Evolution; Cyprinodontiformes; DNA, Mitochondrial; Female; Genetic Speciation; Genetic Variation; Genotype; Geography; Hybridization, Genetic; Linkage Disequilibrium; Male; Mexico; Phylogeny; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Reproduction; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Pisces; Poeciliidae; Xiphophorus; Xiphophorus birchmanni; Xiphophorus malinche",Article,"",Scopus

While natural selection can lead to local adaptation, high connectivity can diminish the potential for such adaptation to occur. Connectivity, defined as the exchange of individuals among subpopulations, is presumed to be significant in most marine species due to life histories that include widely dispersive stages. However, evidence of local adaptation in marine species, such the Atlantic silverside, Menidia menidia, raises questions concerning the degree of connectivity. We examined geochemical signatures in the otoliths, or ear bones, of adult Atlantic silversides collected in 11 locations along the northeastern coast of the United States from New Jersey to Maine in 2004 and eight locations in 2005 using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and isotope ratio monitoring mass spectrometry (irm-MS). These signatures were then compared to baseline signatures of juvenile fish of known origin to determine natal origin of these adult fish. We then estimated migration distances and the degree of mixing from these data. In both years, fish generally had the highest probability of originating from the same location in which they were captured (0.01-0.80), but evidence of mixing throughout the sample area was present. Furthermore, adult M. menidia exhibit highly dispersive behavior with some fish migrating over 700 km. The probability of adult fish returning to natal areas differed between years, with the probability being, on average, 0.2 higher in the second year. These findings demonstrate that marine species with largely open populations are capable of local adaptation despite apparently high gene flow. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.","Atlantic silverside; Connectivity; Gene flow; Local adaptation; Menidia menidia; Northeastern U.S. Coast; Otolith chemistry; Population structure","biochemistry; bone; connectivity; data set; gene flow; geochemistry; inductively coupled plasma method; isotopic ratio; juvenile; life history; local adaptation; marine ecosystem; migration; natural selection; otolith; population structure; subpopulation; teleost; adaptation; animal; article; Atlantic Ocean; demography; ecosystem; physiology; Smegmamorpha; vestibule; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Atlantic Ocean; Demography; Ecosystem; Otolithic Membrane; Smegmamorpha; Maine; New Jersey; United States; Menidia; Menidia menidia",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

Roach (Rutilus rutilus), a freshwater fish, engage in partial migration where parts of populations switch between summer habitats in lakes and winter habitats in connected streams. To test if the partial migration trait is phenotypically plastic or has genetic components, we translocated roach from 2 populations with different opportunities for migration to a lake with migration opportunity, containing a local roach population. This enabled monitoring of partial migration of fish in 3 different situations: 1) previous opportunity for migration, migrating in a familiar environment (the local population); 2) previous opportunity for migration, migrating in an unfamiliar environment; and 3) no previous opportunity for seasonal migration, migrating in an unfamiliar environment. In addition, we evaluated the migration patterns of roach in the lake with migration opportunity wherefrom group 2 fish were translocated. Directional migration in and out of the lakes was monitored using Passive Integrated Transponder technology. Translocated fish with previous migration opportunity showed migration patterns more similar to local fish than to their home lake population, and individuals translocated from the lake without migration opportunity migrated when given the opportunity, suggesting that partial migration is phenotypically plastic and triggered by lake-specific environmental cues. We found temperature to be a proximate cue for migration decisions. Individuals without previous migration opportunity migrated at a lower proportion and with different small-scale migration patterns, suggesting that also genetic components are involved in the expression of the partial migration trait. © The Author 2010.

In particular, tracking natural enemy recruitment to invading hosts can reveal the relative roles of co-evolution (including local adaptation) and ecological sorting. We use molecular data to examine colonisation of northern Europe by the parasitoid Megastigmus stigmatizans following invasions of its herbivorous oak gallwasp hosts from the Balkans. Local host adaptation predicts that invading gallwasp populations will have been tracked primarily by sympatric Balkan populations of M. stigmatizans (Host Pursuit Hypothesis). Alternatively, ecological sorting allows parasitoid recruitment from geographically distinct populations with no recent experience of the invading hosts (Host Shift Hypothesis). Finally, we test for long-term persistence of parasitoids introduced via human trade of their hosts' galls (Introduction Hypothesis). Results: Polymorphism diagnostic of different southern refugial regions was present in both mitochondrial and nuclear microsatellite markers, allowing us to identify the origins of northern European invaded range M. stigmatizans populations. As with their hosts, some invaded range populations showed genetic variation diagnostic of Balkan sources, supporting the Host Pursuit Hypothesis. In contrast, other invading populations had an Iberian origin, unlike their hosts in northern Europe, supporting the Host Shift Hypothesis. Finally, both British and Italian M. stigmatizans populations show signatures compatible with the Introduction Hypothesis from eastern Mediterranean sources. Conclusions: These data reveal the continental scale of multi-trophic impacts of anthropogenic disturbance and highlight the fact that herbivores and their natural enemies may face very different constraints on range expansion. The ability of natural enemies to exploit ecologically-similar hosts with which they have had no historical association supports a major role for ecological sorting processes in the recent assembly of these communities. The multitude of origins of invading natural enemy populations in this study emphasises the diversity of mechanisms requiring consideration when predicting consequences of other biological invasions or biological control introductions. © 2010 Nicholls et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"anthropogenic effect; biological invasion; coevolution; colonization; genetic marker; genetic variation; herbivore; local adaptation; natural enemy; range expansion; recruitment (population dynamics); wasp; Balkan; Europe; Turkmenistan; Megastigmus stigmatizans; microsatellite DNA; mitochondrial DNA; animal; article; classification; Europe; genetics; haplotype; host parasite interaction; oak; parasitology; pathogenicity; phylogeny; physiology; wasp; Animals; DNA, Mitochondrial; Europe; Haplotypes; Host-Parasite Interactions; Microsatellite Repeats; Phylogeny; Quercus; Wasps",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Here, populations of the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus are examined at both local and latitudinal scales to determine whether these populations have evolved differences in their survival under high temperature stress. A clear pattern of increasing high temperature stress tolerance is seen with decreasing latitude, consistent with temperature adaptation. Additionally, there is also evidence for significant variation in thermal tolerance on a smaller scale. The competitive fitness of pairs of northern and southern copepod populations were also examined under a series of lower, more moderate temperatures. These fitness assays show that the southern populations that have the best survival under extreme high temperatures have lowered competitive fitness at the lower temperatures tested, whereas the fitness of the southern populations exceeded that of the northern populations at the highest temperatures tested. Combined, these results suggest that there may be evolutionary trade-offs between performance at high and stressful temperatures and fitness at moderate temperatures in this species. © 2010 The Author(s).

Genetic isolation by distance patterns hold clues to dispersal, but understanding these patterns quantitatively has been complicated by uncertainty in effective density. In this study, we genotyped populations of a coral reef fish (Amphiprion clarkii) at 13 microsatellite loci to uncover fine-scale isolation by distance patterns in two replicate transects. Temporal changes in allele frequencies between generations suggested that effective densities in these populations are 4-21 adults/km. A separate estimate from census densities suggested that effective densities may be as high as 82-178 adults/km. Applying these effective densities with isolation by distance theory suggested that larval dispersal kernels in A. clarkii had a spread near 11 km (4-27 km). These kernels predicted low fractions of self-recruitment in continuous habitats, but the same kernels were consistent with previously reported, high self-recruitment fractions (40-60%) when realistic levels of habitat patchiness were considered. Our results suggested that ecologically relevant larval dispersal can be estimated with widely available genetic methods when effective density is measured carefully through cohort sampling and ecological censuses, and that self-recruitment studies should be interpreted in light of habitat patchiness. © 2010 The Author(s).

Analysis of molecular variance revealed a very strong genetic structure among 5 regions in H. armiger. A neighbor-joining tree, haplotype network construction by TCS and multidimensional scaling plots all showed significant geographic differentiation among 5 regions. The high genetic structure detected in H. armiger could be a consequence of poor dispersal ability, local adaptation, or marked female philopatry. The lack of genetic structure among 3 regions separated by the Gaoligong Range and the Qiongzhou Strait could be due to incomplete lineage sorting. Our estimated times of divergence for H. armiger populations suggested a relatively recent split. The S Yunnan population with the highest genetic diversity and the Hainan population with the lowest genetic diversity should be equally given priority for conservation.

This designation is decades old and warrants re-evaluation in light of concerns that fisheries management units may not reflect biologically meaningful population units. In this study, we used 10 microsatellite loci, the PanI locus, and 5 single nucleotide polymorphism markers to characterize the population genetic structure of cod in US waters. We found significant differentiation among temporally and spatially divergent populations of cod (global FST = 0.0044), primarily stemming from 2 potentially non-neutral loci, and evidence for a population structure that strongly contradicts the current 2-stock management model. This genetic structure was stable over a 5 yr period. Our results indicate that cod in US waters are broadly structured into 3 groups: (1) a northern spring-spawning coastal complex in the Gulf of Maine (GOM), (2) a southern complex consisting of winter-spawning inshore GOM, offshore GOM and sites south of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and (3) a Georges Bank population. The strongest differentiation occurs between populations in the northern and southern complex (mean FST = 0.0085), some of which spawn in the same bays in different seasons. By means of mixture analysis, young-of-the-year fish sampled on juvenile nurseries were assigned to the spawning complex of their origin. Our findings contribute to a growing body of knowledge that Atlantic cod and other marine fish populations are structured on a finer scale than previously thought and that this structure supports biocomplexity and locally adapted populations. As such, it may be warranted to re-evaluate current management units and tailor management plans toward this finer scale.

In the absence of natural selection, gene genealogies should all be sampled from the same underlying distribution, often approximated by a coalescent model. Selection at a particular locus will lead to a modified genealogy, and this motivates a number of recent approaches for detecting the effects of natural selection in the genome as ""outliers"" under some models. The demographic history of a population affects the sampling distribution of genealogies, and therefore the observed genotypes and the classification of outliers. Since we cannot see genealogies directly, we have to infer them from the observed data under some model of mutation and demography. Thus the accuracy of an outlier-based approach depends to a greater or a lesser extent on the uncertainty about the demographic and mutational model. A natural modeling framework for this type of problem is provided by Bayesian hierarchical models, in which parameters, such as mutation rates and selection coefficients, are allowed to vary across loci. It has proved quite difficult computationally to implement fully probabilistic genealogical models with complex demographies, and this has motivated the development of approximations such as approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). In ABC the data are compressed into summary statistics, and computation of the likelihood function is replaced by simulation of data under the model. In a hierarchical setting one may be interested both in hyperparameters and parameters, and there may be very many of the latter - for example, in a genetic model, these may be parameters describing each of many loci or populations. This poses a problem for ABC in that one then requires summary statistics for each locus, which, if used naively, leads to a consequent difficulty in conditional density estimation. We develop a general method for applying ABC to Bayesian hierarchical models, and we apply it to detect microsatellite loci influenced by local selection. We demonstrate using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis that this approach has comparable performance to a full-likelihood method and outperforms it when mutation rates are variable across loci.

However, both mechanisms are presumed to incur (energetic) costs and to trade-off with other life-history traits. To test this hypothesis, we exposed Pardosa saltans (Lycosidae) spiderlings originating from metal-polluted and unpolluted sites to a controlled cadmium (Cd) treatment, and compared contents of metal-binding metallothionein-like proteins (MTLPs), internal metal concentrations, and individual survival and growth rates with a reference treatment. While increased MTLP concentrations in offspring originating from both polluted and unpolluted populations upon exposure indicates a plastic tolerance mechanism, survival and growth rates remain largely unaffected, independent of the population of origin. However, MTLP and Cd concentrations were not significantly correlated. We suggest that MTLP production may be an important mechanism enabling P. saltans populations to persist in ecosystems polluted with heavy metals above a certain level. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

However, body size and body condition of individuals can vary significantly at the intraspecific level between geographic locations, which is usually explained by phenotypic plasticity or local adaptation. We suggest that a higher body condition per se might not be a good indicator of physiological health status, particularly when comparing populations inhabiting places with different levels of habitat alteration. We examined two populations of the western pond turtle Emys marmorata in the northern part of California's Central Valley, and found that individuals inhabiting a water pollution control plant located on the valley floor had significantly larger body size and higher body condition than those inhabiting an unaltered natural habitat in the foothills. However, turtles from the water pollution control plant did not show a better health status, estimated by comparisons between two immune system variables: T-cell-mediated immune response and heterophil/lymphocyte ratio. Parameters such as body size and body condition might be misleading indicators of health condition, particularly when they are used to estimate health status of populations from habitats with different levels of alteration. We emphasize the importance of using physiological methods in assessing the conservation state of wildlife populations, rather than relying on biometric indices that might miss important effects of alteration. © 2009 The Authors.

However, the variable degree of differentiation in both species suggests that the extent of reciprocal selection and local adaptation in the species will vary geographically, a result consistent with the concept of a geographic mosaic of coevolution. The pattern of variation in C. anisopoma shows clear evidence of recent spatial expansion, possibly due to increased habitat availability following the last glacial maximum. Phylogeographic analyses suggest that M. l. angelica diversified into three distinct clades after the colonization of the Gulf.

Species comprising populations that are genetically adapted to local climatic conditions should be more vulnerable to climate change than those comprising phenotypically plastic populations. Assessment of local adaptation generally requires logistically challenging experiments. Here, using a unique approach and a large dataset (>50,000 observations from across Britain), we compare the covariation in temperature and first spawning dates of the common frog (Rana temporaria) across space with that across time. We show that although all populations exhibit a plastic response to temperature, spawning earlier in warmer years, between-population differences in first spawning dates are dominated by local adaptation. Given climate change projections for Britain in 2050-2070, we project that for populations to remain as locally adapted as contemporary populations will require first spawning date to advance by ∼21-39 days but that plasticity alone will only enable an advance of ∼5-9 days. Populations may thus face a microevolutionary and gene flow challenge to advance first spawning date by a further ∼16-30 days over the next 50 years.","Climate change; Ecogeographic; Phenology; Plasticity; Quantitative genetics","adult; article; case report; climate change; frog; human; local adaptation; nonhuman; population; priority journal; spawning; temperature; United Kingdom; Rana temporaria",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus

Over millennia, living 'on country', many of these communities have developed a sophisticated appreciation of their local ecosystems and the climatic patterns associated with the changes in them. Some of this knowledge is recorded in their oral history passed down through generations, documented in seasonal weather calendars in local languages and, to a limited degree, transcribed and translated into English. This knowledge is still highly valued by these communities today, as it is used to direct hunting, fishing and planting as well as to inform many seasonally dependant cultural events. In recent years, local observations have been recognised by non-Indigenous scientists as a vital source of environmental data where few historic records exist. Similar to the way that phenological observations in the UK and US provide baseline information on past climates, this paper suggests that Indigenous observations of seasonal change have the potential to fill gaps in climate data for tropical northern Australia, and could also serve to inform culturally appropriate adaptation strategies. One method of recording recent direct and indirect climate and weather observations for the Torres Strait Islands is documented in this paper to demonstrate the currency of local observations of climate and its variability. The paper concludes that a comprehensive, participatory programme to record Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander knowledge of past climate patterns, and recent observations of change, would be timely and valuable for the communities themselves, as well as contributing to a greater understanding of regional climate change that would be useful for the wider Australian population. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Adaptation strategies; Climate data; Climate patterns; Colonisation; Cultural events; Environmental data; Governance structures; Indigenous people; Local language; Natural environments; Non-indigenous; Northern Australia; Phenological observations; Regional climate changes; Remote areas; Seasonal changes; Vital sources; Weather observations; Agriculture; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; fishing; hunting; indigenous knowledge; indigenous population; language; paleoclimate; participatory approach; phenology; regional climate; Australia; Queensland; Torres Strait; Torres Strait Islands",Article,"",Scopus

Consequently, patterns of MHC genetic variation should reflect selection pressures across the landscape. We examined genetic variation and population genetic structure at the MHC class I-A1 and class II-B1 exons in five Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) populations from two geographic regions in British Columbia, Canada. We then compared estimates of population structure at the MHC genes with neutral estimates based on microsatellites to examine the potential for local adaptation at the MHC. Chinook salmon are in decline throughout much of their native range and understanding the degree of local adaptation exhibited by the MHC may be important in conservation planning. Comparisons among populations yielded higher G′ ST estimates for the MHC class I than expected under neutrality based on the microsatellites. In contrast, the MHC class II tended to exhibit lower G′ ST values than did the microsatellites. These results suggest that across populations unique selection pressures are driving allele frequency differences at the MHC class I but that the MHC class II may be the subject of homogenizing selection. Rates of nonsynonymous versus synonymous substitutions found in codons associated within the MHC class I and II peptide-binding regions provided strong evidence of positive selection. Together, these results support the hypothesis that selection is influencing genetic variation at the MHC, but suggest that selection pressures may vary at the two classes of loci both at the sequence and population levels. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.","Chinook salmon; Local adaptation; Major histocompatibility complex; Population genetic structure; Selection","microsatellite DNA; conservation planning; divergence; genetic analysis; genetic marker; genetic structure; genetic variation; geographical region; local adaptation; pathotype; salmonid; selection; allele; animal; article; gene; gene frequency; gene locus; genetic variability; genetics; population genetics; salmon; Alleles; Animals; Gene Frequency; Genes, MHC Class I; Genes, MHC Class II; Genetic Loci; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Microsatellite Repeats; Salmon; British Columbia; Canada; Oncorhynchus tshawytscha",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus

In general, population structure identified by genetic differentiation was consistent with the patterns of variation in gene expression, although there was not a strong correlation between neutral genetic variation and variation in gene expression. Both data sets provided clear indication of strong regional differentiation between rivers located within the inner Bay of Fundy relative to rivers located within the outer Bay of Fundy or the Southern Upland region, and there was also support for more refined population structure.

Additionally, natural populations offer an advantage over most common research organisms because they are subject to natural selection, and analyses of these adaptations can be used to identify biologically important changes. Among fishes, these analyses are enhanced by having a wide diversity of species (>28 000 species, more than any other group of vertebrates) living in a huge range of environments (from below freezing to > 46° C, in fresh water to salinities >40 ppt.). Moreover, fishes exhibit many different life-history and reproductive strategies and have many different phenotypes and social structures. Although fishes provide numerous advantages over other vertebrate models, there is still a dearth of available genomic tools for fishes. Fishes make up approximately half of all known vertebrate species, yet <0·2% of fish species have significant genomic resources. Nonetheless, genomic approaches with fishes have provided some of the first measures of individual variation in gene expression and insights into environmental and ecological adaptations. Thus, genomic approaches with natural fish populations have the potential to revolutionize fundamental studies of diverse fish species that offer myriad ecological and evolutionary questions. © 2010 The Author.

Protein biomarker analyses assessing physiological contributions to stress resistance showed evidence for both fixed and environmental influence on biomarker response. Fixed influences were strongest for ubiquitin-conjugated proteins with consistently higher levels found in back reef source colonies both pre and post-transplant when compared with their forereef conspecifics.

Spawning traits often differ among populations, but it is largely unknown if these differences are adaptive or due to genetic drift. To test if sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) populations are adapted to glacial, beach, and tributary spawning habitats, we examined variation in heritable phenotypic traits associated with spawning in 13 populations of wild sockeye salmon in Lake Clark, Alaska. These populations were commonly founded between 100 and 400 hundred sockeye salmon generations ago and exhibit low genetic divergence at 11 microsatellite loci (FST &lt; 0.024) that is uncorrelated with spawning habitat type. We found that mean PST (phenotypic divergence among populations) exceeded neutral FST for most phenotypic traits measured, indicating that phenotypic differences among populations could not be explained by genetic drift alone. Phenotypic divergence among populations was associated with spawning habitat differences, but not with neutral genetic divergence. For example, female body color was lighter and egg color was darker in glacial than non-glacial habitats. This may be due to reduced sexual selection for red spawning color in glacial habitats and an apparent trade-off in carotenoid allocation to body and egg color in females. Phenotypic plasticity is an unlikely source of phenotypic differences because Lake Clark sockeye salmon spend nearly all their lives in a common environment. Our data suggest that Lake Clark sockeye salmon populations are adapted to spawning in glacial, beach and tributary habitats and provide the first evidence of a glacial spawning ecotype in salmonids. Glacial spawning habitats are often young (i. e., &lt;200 years old) and ephemeral.

Moreover, variation in the strength of these bottom-up inputs is often spatially consistent, linked to regional centers of upwelling, coastal topography, and other stable features of the coastline. Whereas the ecological effects of these oceanographic links are increasingly clear, the possibility that these same bottom-up forces might impose spatially varying selection on consumers has not been addressed. Here, we test the hypothesis that a carnivorous snail (Nucella canaliculata) with direct development is locally adapted to persistent differences in prey recruitment within two adjacent oceanographic regions (northern California and Oregon, USA). Previous laboratory studies demonstrated that snails from Oregon rarely drilled the thick-shelled mussel Mytilus californianus, whereas snails from California readily drilled this prey. To test whether these differences reflect local adaptation, snails from two populations in each region were raised through two laboratory generations to minimize the potential influence of nongenetic effects. We then reciprocally outplanted these F2 generation snails to field enclosures at each of the four sites and monitored their growth for 11 months. Recruitment and availability of preferred prey (the acorn barnacle Balanus glandula and blue mussel Mytilus trossulus) at the experimental sites were 1-3 orders of magnitude lower in California than in. Oregon. At the California sites, snails that originated from Oregon sources failed to drill larger M. californianus, encountered few alternative prey, and showed almost no growth. In contrast, snails from California drilled M. californianus and showed substantial growth. These results strongly suggest that the capacity of California snails to drill M. californianus allows these snails to succeed in an oceanographic region where the recruitment of alternative, preferred prey is low. More broadly, our results suggest that persistent spatial variation in recruitment and other oceanographically mediated processes may lead to adaptive differentiation among populations of consumers in adjacent coastal regions. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.","Bottom-up effects; Coastal oceanography; Divergent; Geographic variation; Larval recruitment; Local adaptation; Mytilus; Natural selection; Nucella; Reciprocal transfer experiment; Rocky intertidal communities","bivalve; coastal zone; divergence; environmental conditions; geographical variation; hypothesis testing; larval development; local adaptation; natural selection; predator; prey availability; prey preference; recruitment (population dynamics); snail; adaptation; animal; article; ecosystem; Mytilus; Pacific Ocean; physiology; predation; snail; Thoracica; United States; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; California; Ecosystem; Mytilus; Oregon; Pacific Ocean; Predatory Behavior; Snails; Thoracica; California; Oregon; United States; Balanidae; Balanus glandula; Gastropoda; Mytilus; Mytilus californianus; Mytilus edulis; Mytilus trossulus; Nucella; Nucella canaliculata",Article,"",Scopus

To investigate whether Arabidopsis lyrata is locally adapted to serpentine soil, and to map the polymorphisms responsible for such adaptation, we pooled DNA from individuals from serpentine and nonserpentine soils and sequenced each 'gene pool' with the Illumina Genome Analyzer. The polymorphisms that are most strongly associated with soil type are enriched at heavy-metal detoxification and calcium and magnesium transport loci, providing numerous candidate mutations for serpentine adaptation. Sequencing of three candidate loci in the European subspecies of A. lyrata indicates parallel differentiation of the same polymorphism at one locus, confirming ecological adaptation, and different polymorphisms at two other loci, which may indicate convergent evolution. © 2010 Nature America, Inc.

This theory assumes that significant evolutionary change occurs over ecologically relevant timescales and that phenotypes have differential effects on the environment. Here we test the hypothesis that local adaptation causes ecosystem structure and function to diverge.We demonstrate that populations of Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata), characterized by differences in phenotypic and population-level traits, differ in their impact on ecosystem properties. We report results froma replicated, common gardenmesocosm experiment and show that differences between guppy phenotypes result in the divergence of ecosystem structure (algal, invertebrate, and detrital standing stocks) and function (gross primary productivity, leaf decomposition rates, and nutrient flux). These phenotypic effects are further modified by effects of guppy density. We evaluated the generality of these effects by replicating the experiment using guppies derived fromtwoindependent origins of the phenotype. Finally, we tested the ability of multiple guppy traits to explain observed differences in themesocosms.Our findings demonstrate that evolution can significantly affect both ecosystem structure and function. The ecosystem differences reported here are consistent with patterns observed across natural streams and argue that guppies play a significant role in shaping these ecosystems.","Ecological-evolutionary feedbacks; Ecosystem function; Intraspecific variation","alga; article; Cyprinodontiformes; decomposition; ecosystem; environment; evolution; genetic trait; hypothesis; invertebrate; local adaptation; mesocosm; nonhuman; nutrient; phenotype; plant leaf; population; priority journal; productivity; stream (river); Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Ecosystem; Poecilia; Population Density; algae; Invertebrata; Poecilia reticulata",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus

However, geographic variation itself is not a proof for local adaptation, as genetic drift and gene flow may also shape patterns of quantitative variation. We studied local and regional variation in means and phenotypic plasticity of larval life history traits in the common frog Rana temporaria using six populations from central Sweden, breeding in either open-canopy or partially closed-canopy ponds. To separate local adaptation from genetic drift, we compared differentiation in quantitative genetic traits (QST) obtained from a common garden experiment with differentiation in presumably neutral microsatellite markers (FST). We found that R. temporaria populations differ in means and plasticities of life history traits in different temperatures at local, and in FST at regional scale. Comparisons of differentiation in quantitative traits and in molecular markers suggested that natural selection was responsible for the divergence in growth and development rates as well as in temperature-induced plasticity, indicating local adaptation. However, at low temperature, the role of genetic drift could not be separated from selection. Phenotypes were correlated with forest canopy closure, but not with geographical or genetic distance. These results indicate that local adaptation can evolve in the presence of ongoing gene flow among the populations, and that natural selection is strong in this system. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Countergradient variation; Gene flow; Genetic drift; Local adaptation; Phenotypic plasticity","microsatellite DNA; adaptation; animal; article; biological model; DNA sequence; ecosystem; frog; gene flow; genetic drift; genetic selection; genetics; geography; phenotype; population genetics; quantitative trait; Sweden; temperature; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Ecosystem; Gene Flow; Genetic Drift; Genetics, Population; Geography; Microsatellite Repeats; Models, Genetic; Phenotype; Quantitative Trait, Heritable; Rana temporaria; Selection, Genetic; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Sweden; Temperature; Anura; Rana temporaria",Article,"",Scopus

Using a novel perspective, we investigated the potential influence of endemism on the relationship between larval supply and recruitment in reef fish populations at Lord Howe Island, Australia. Larval supply and recruitment were measured for three regional endemic and four widespread non-endemic species using light traps, artificial collectors, and underwater visual censuses. Recruitment was correlated with larval supply in endemics but not in non-endemics, likely due to a combination of low larval supply and post-settlement survival of non-endemics. Surveys also indicated that endemics were far more abundant and occurred in more locations than closely related non-endemics. These preliminary findings suggest that either local adaptation enhances recruitment in endemics through higher larval replenishment rates or reduced post-settlement mortality, populations of widespread species at the periphery of their range are poorly adapted to local environmental conditions and therefore experience lower and more variable settlement and post-settlement survival rates, or both. © Springer-Verlag 2009.","Endemism; Larval supply; Local adaptation; Recruitment; Reef fish","census; coral reef; endemic species; endemism; environmental conditions; larval settlement; larval transport; local adaptation; population distribution; recruitment (population dynamics); spatial distribution; survival; Australia; Lord Howe Island; New South Wales; Anthozoa",Article,"",Scopus

A. Fisher and others. It dominated the first century of evolutionary biology, but has been challenged in more recent years both by field surveys demonstrating strong selection in natural populations and by quantitative trait loci and genomic studies, indicating that adaptation is often attributable to mutations in a few genes. The prevalence of strong selection seems inconsistent, however, with the high heritability often observed in natural populations, and with the claim that the amount of morphological change in contemporary and fossil lineages is independent of elapsed time. I argue that these discrepancies are resolved by realistic accounts of environmental and evolutionary changes. First, the physical and biotic environment varies on all time-scales, leading to an indefinite increase in environmental variance over time. Secondly, the intensity and direction of natural selection are also likely to fluctuate over time, leading to an indefinite increase in phenotypic variance in any given evolving lineage. Finally, detailed long-term studies of selection in natural populations demonstrate that selection often changes in direction. I conclude that the traditional gradualist scheme of weak selection acting on polygenic variation should be supplemented by the view that adaptation is often based on oligogenic variation exposed to commonplace, strong, fluctuating natural selection. © 2010 The Royal Society.","Environmental variation; Fluctuating selection; Infinitesimal model; Natural selection; Oligogenic model; Selection coefficient","adaptation; environmental gradient; evolutionary biology; field survey; fossil record; genomics; mutation; natural selection; Oligocene; phenotype; population distribution",Review,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus

These objectives were addressed by comparing broad sense heritabilities and genetic correlations using up to 20 distinct clonal lineages randomly obtained from two populations: one located in a water reservoir contaminated by the acid mine drainage, and the other located in a nearby clean water reservoir. Results showed that only sensitive and resistant lineages to Cu were present in the reference and contaminated site, respectively. For Zn, however, both populations had a similar distribution pattern of sensitivities. Heritability values for tolerant and feeding traits across metal exposure levels was similar in both populations being in most cases greater than 50%. Fitness costs of tolerance were illustrated by lower feeding rates of the tolerant population compared to the reference one and negative genetic correlations between mean clonal feeding rates and median clonal survival time in control conditions (no added Cu or Zn). The results obtained thus support the view that tolerance to pollution is ecologically costly. © 2009 SETAC.","Adaptation; Daphnia longispina; Fitness costs; Metals; Tolerance","Acids; Copper mines; Costs; Drainage; Feeding; Genetic engineering; Health; Metals; Mining; Pollution; Zinc; Acid mine drainage; Adaptation; Broad-sense heritability; Clean waters; Contaminated sites; Daphnia longispina; Distribution patterns; Exposure level; Feeding rate; Genetic correlation; Genetic variability; In-control; Low level; Physiological trait; Pyrite mine; Survival time; Water reservoir; Reservoirs (water); copper; metal; pyrite; zinc; copper; water pollutant; zinc; acid mine drainage; copper; crustacean; fitness; genetic variation; local adaptation; pollution exposure; pollution tolerance; zinc; acid mine drainage; animal food; article; clone; contamination; controlled study; Daphnia; environmental exposure; evolutionary adaptation; genetic correlation; genetic variability; heritability; long term exposure; nonhuman; pollution; population exposure; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; survival time; water contamination; water supply; adaptation; animal; drug effects; genetic variability; genetics; mining; toxicity; water pollutant; Daphnia longispina; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Copper; Daphnia; Genetic Variation; Mining; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Zinc",Article,"",Scopus

Factors such as temperature, food quantity and even the presence or absence of predators influence growth, reproduction and morphology of individuals. Recently, it has also become clear that the quality of the food can affect various life history traits of Daphnia. More specifically, the effect of the elemental composition of algae, expressed as the C:P ratio, has been studied intensively. Daphnia species differ in their response to differences in the C:P ratio of their food. Until now, it has been unclear whether these species differences are driven by phylogenetic constraints or by adaptation to particular environmental conditions. Here we present laboratory experiments with 12 Daphnia species from three different subgenera originating from a broad range of habitats. We compared somatic growth rates and sensitivity to variation in the nutrient stoichiometry of the food with habitat parameters, taking into account the phylogenetic history of the species. No associations between fitness and habitat parameters were detected. However, we found a trade-off between sensitivity to P-deficient diets and the maximum growth rate on a P-sufficient diet. In several cases, this trade-off helps to explain the association between species distribution and habitat parameters. We observed no correlation of the sensitivity to P limitation with the phylogenetic history of the genus Daphnia. Thus, we conclude that the differential responses among Daphnia species to variation in P content in food were driven mainly by adaptations to their local habitats, and are not constrained by deep evolutionary patterns. © Springer-Verlag 2009.","Cladocera; Food quality; Life history; Phylogeny","crustacean; evolutionary biology; food quality; freshwater ecosystem; life history; local adaptation; phylogenetics; phylogeny; animal; article; comparative study; Daphnia; growth, development and aging; metabolism; phosphate intake; phylogeny; physiology; population dynamics; species difference; Animals; Daphnia; Phosphorus, Dietary; Phylogeny; Population Dynamics; Species Specificity; algae; Cladocera; Daphnia",Article,"",Scopus

Overall, 84 mtDNA haplotypes were defined, and were split into three clades by the phylogenetic trees. The divergences of COI gene sequence among the three clades ranged from 11.4 to 22.5%, indicating the occurrence of three cryptic species (cryptic species 1, cryptic species 2, and cryptic species 3). Within cryptic species 3, a remarkable degree of differentiation (Fst = 0.0947) might be attributable to habitat fragmentation, restricted gene flow, and founder effect, most probably together with local adaptation. The more shared haplotypes were observed, and a non-significant correlation existed between geographic and genetic distance, suggesting that some ancestral haplotypes might be involved in a past range expansion, and as founders give a similar distribution pattern among geographic populations. The networks were also in agreement with the pattern of genetic differentiation in B. calyciflorus species complex revealed by molecular phylogeny. The nested clade analysis suggested a slight geographic structure in the network I, network II, and the highest nesting clade levels within the network III. Under the possible effect of the Younger Dryas Event, the three cryptic species might have survived in multiple relict refugia throughout the south of China. The co-occurrence of cryptic species 2 and 3 might be found in Guangzhou and Hainan due to the possible interference of the barrier and contiguous range expansion. After the Younger Dryas Event, cryptic species 3 with high colonization ability might have arrived and colonized whole habitats at first, and reduce effective gene flow among cryptic species, thus effectively increasing persistence of founder events. Cryptic species 2 might, respectively, have expanded their ranges into Wuhu and Nanjing regions only because of the probable barrier of the Yangtze River, its weak colonization abilities and the 'priority effects' of cryptic species 3. Cryptic species 1 distributed exclusively in Danzhou probably failed to expand its ranges into mainland China because of small population size, weaker dispersal capacity, and the barrier of the Qiongzhou Strait. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.","Brachionus calyciflorus; Genetic differentiation; Nested clade analysis; Phylogeography; Spatial pattern; Species complex","Brachionus; Co-occurrence; Cryptic species; Distribution patterns; East China; Founder effect; Gene flows; Gene sequences; Genetic differentiation; Genetic distances; Geographic structures; Guangzhou; Habitat fragmentation; Haplotypes; Local adaptation; Molecular phylogeny; Nanjing; Phylogenetic trees; Phylogeography; Qiongzhou strait; Range expansion; Small population; Spatial patterns; Yangtze River; Younger Dryas; Biology; Population statistics; Genes; cladistics; coexistence; colonization; divergence; gene flow; genetic differentiation; habitat fragmentation; invertebrate; local adaptation; mitochondrial DNA; phylogeny; phylogeography; population size; range expansion; spatial variation; species complex; Younger Dryas; China; Brachionus calyciflorus",Article,"",Scopus

Estimates of connectivity, moreover, do not always scale with distance and are sometimes counterintuitive. Population connectivity requires more than just the simple exchange of settlers among populations: it also requires the successful establishment and reproduction of exogenous colonizers. Marine organisms often disperse over large spatial scales, encountering very different environments and suffering extremely high levels of post-colonization mortality. Given the growing evidence that such selection pressures often vary over spatial scales that are much smaller than those of dispersal, we argue that selection will bias survival against exogenous colonizers. We call this selection against exogenous colonizers a phenotype-environment mismatch and argue that phenotype- environment mismatches represent an important barrier to connectivity in the sea. Crucially, these mismatches may operate independently of distance and thereby have the potential to explain the counterintuitive patterns of connectivity often seen in marine environments. We discuss how such mismatches might alter our understanding and management of marine populations. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.","Connectivity; Dispersal; Larvae; Local adaptation; Phenotypic plasticity; Recruitment","sea water; colonization; connectivity; dispersal; larva; local adaptation; marine ecosystem; phenotype; phenotypic plasticity; propagule; recruitment (population dynamics); survival; adaptation; animal; article; biological model; genetic selection; phenotype; population dynamics; population migration; Adaptation, Physiological; Animal Migration; Animals; Models, Biological; Phenotype; Population Dynamics; Seawater; Selection, Genetic",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus
