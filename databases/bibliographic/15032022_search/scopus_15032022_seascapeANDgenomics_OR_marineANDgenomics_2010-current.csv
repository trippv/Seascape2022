Such omics-based techniques allow us to read genomic blueprints of microorganisms, decipher their functional capacities and activities, and reconstruct their roles in biogeochemical processes. Currently available tools for analyses of genomic data can annotate and depict metabolic functions to some extent; however, no standardized approaches are currently available for the comprehensive characterization of metabolic predictions, metabolite exchanges, microbial interactions, and microbial contributions to biogeochemical cycling. Results: We present METABOLIC (METabolic And BiogeOchemistry anaLyses In miCrobes), a scalable software to advance microbial ecology and biogeochemistry studies using genomes at the resolution of individual organisms and/or microbial communities. The genome-scale workflow includes annotation of microbial genomes, motif validation of biochemically validated conserved protein residues, metabolic pathway analyses, and calculation of contributions to individual biogeochemical transformations and cycles. The community-scale workflow supplements genome-scale analyses with determination of genome abundance in the microbiome, potential microbial metabolic handoffs and metabolite exchange, reconstruction of functional networks, and determination of microbial contributions to biogeochemical cycles. METABOLIC can take input genomes from isolates, metagenome-assembled genomes, or single-cell genomes. Results are presented in the form of tables for metabolism and a variety of visualizations including biogeochemical cycling potential, representation of sequential metabolic transformations, community-scale microbial functional networks using a newly defined metric “MW-score” (metabolic weight score), and metabolic Sankey diagrams. METABOLIC takes ~ 3 h with 40 CPU threads to process ~ 100 genomes and corresponding metagenomic reads within which the most compute-demanding part of hmmsearch takes ~ 45 min, while it takes ~ 5 h to complete hmmsearch for ~ 3600 genomes. Tests of accuracy, robustness, and consistency suggest METABOLIC provides better performance compared to other software and online servers. To highlight the utility and versatility of METABOLIC, we demonstrate its capabilities on diverse metagenomic datasets from the marine subsurface, terrestrial subsurface, meadow soil, deep sea, freshwater lakes, wastewater, and the human gut. Conclusion: METABOLIC enables the consistent and reproducible study of microbial community ecology and biogeochemistry using a foundation of genome-informed microbial metabolism, and will advance the integration of uncultivated organisms into metabolic and biogeochemical models.

Among many of the genus characteristics, there is the ability to produce enzymes and molecules of industrial biotechnology importance, such as pigments and proteins related to heavy metal bioremediation. The bacterium strain Psychrobacter nivimaris LAMA 639 was isolated from sediments from the Walvis Ridge ocean crest at a depth of 4.400 m (33.40 S 2.35 E). It is a nonmotile, halotolerant, cream-colored gram-negative aerobic bacterium. Its cultivation was performed in marine agar plates and inoculated into test tubes with NaCl at an optimal temperature of 30 °C and with shaking at 100 rpm. Genome extraction was performed with the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (QIAGEN®). Sequencing was performed by Macrogen using the NovaSeq® 6000 platform (Illumina) applying the whole genome shotgun (WGS) method. Thereafter, 14.712.526 reads of 151 bp were generated, totaling 2.2 G bp with a GC content of 42.9%. Assembly and mapping were performed with a CLC Genomics Workbench. The best assembly considered was the one with the lowest number of contigs and the highest base length pair. The assemblies were evaluated using QUAST, and the best resulting variant was selected for annotation. Genome annotation was performed with RAST and PATRIC; the antiSMASH tool was used for secondary metabolites; NaPDoS was used for domains; and three-dimensional structural prediction of relevant proteins was performed using Phyre2. Annotation with ClassicRAST generated 2,891 coding sequences (CDSs) distributed in 402 subsystems. Annotation with PATRIC generated 2,896 coding sequences, among them 776 hypothetical proteins. The antiSMASH tool visualized a beta-lactone cluster in contig 06. In the search for natural products with NaPDoS, two ketosynthase domains were identified. The search for relevant proteins was performed using the AMFEP list as a criterion. From these data, 34 possible enzymes with biotechnological potential were found. Finally, the organism is presented as a new reference regarding the potential of deep-sea marine bacteria, demonstrating that, from the annotated and cured genome, it is possible to find in its genetic repertory products of interest for biotechnological applications. © 2022","Enzyme exploiting; Extremophile; Illumina; Psychrobacter; Whole-genome sequencing",,Data Paper,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Specialized anaerobic bacteria metabolize DCM; however, the genetic basis for this process has remained elusive. Comparative genomics of the three known anaerobic DCM-degrading bacterial species revealed a homologous gene cluster, designated the methylene chloride catabolism (mec) gene cassette, comprising 8–10 genes encoding proteins with 79.6%–99.7% amino acid identities. Functional annotation identified genes encoding a corrinoid-dependent methyltransferase system, and shotgun proteomics applied to two DCM-catabolizing cultures revealed high expression of proteins encoded on the mec gene cluster during anaerobic growth with DCM. In a DCM-contaminated groundwater plume, the abundance of mec genes strongly correlated with DCM concentrations (R2 = 0.71–0.85) indicating their potential value as process-specific bioremediation biomarkers. mec gene clusters were identified in metagenomes representing peat bogs, the deep subsurface, and marine ecosystems including oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), suggesting a capacity for DCM degradation in diverse habitats. The broad distribution of anaerobic DCM catabolic potential infers a role for DCM as an energy source in various environmental systems, and implies that the global DCM flux (i.e., the rate of formation minus the rate of consumption) might be greater than emission measurements suggest. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","anaerobic degradation; bioremediation; climate change; dichloromethane flux; ozone destruction",,Article,"",Scopus

They are traditionally thought to biomineralize CaCO3 extracellularly as an indirect byproduct of photosynthesis. However, the recent discovery of freshwater cyanobacteria-forming intracellular amorphous calcium carbonates (iACC) challenges this view. Despite the geochemical interest of such a biomineralization process, its molecular mechanisms and evolutionary history remain elusive. Here, using comparative genomics, we identify a new gene (ccyA) and protein family (calcyanin) possibly associated with cyanobacterial iACC biomineralization. Proteins of the calcyanin family are composed of a conserved C-terminal domain, which likely adopts an original fold, and a variable N-terminal domain whose structure allows differentiating four major types among the 35 known calcyanin homologs. Calcyanin lacks detectable full-length homologs with known function. The overexpression of ccyA in iACC-lacking cyanobacteria resulted in an increased intracellular Ca content. Moreover, ccyA presence was correlated and/or colocalized with genes involved in Ca or HCO3- transport and homeostasis, supporting the hypothesis of a functional role of calcyanin in iACC biomineralization. Whatever its function, ccyA appears as diagnostic of intracellular calcification in cyanobacteria. By searching for ccyA in publicly available genomes, we identified 13 additional cyanobacterial strains forming iACC, as confirmed by microscopy. This extends our knowledge about the phylogenetic and environmental distribution of cyanobacterial iACC biomineralization, especially with the detection of multicellular genera as well as a marine species. Moreover, ccyA was probably present in ancient cyanobacteria, with independent losses in various lineages that resulted in a broad but patchy distribution across modern cyanobacteria. © The Author(s) 2022.

Consequently, it has been the focus of intensive fisheries research for more than 20 years. Here, we present a genomic analysis of population structure that uses a landscape genetics approach to characterize patterns of variation in adult red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) alongside a synoptic view of decades of stock-structure research. The results support Atlantic and GOM stocks and indicate weak heterogeneity within the GOM. Furthermore, redundancy analysis using Moran Eigenvector Maps based on physical distance, larval dispersal probability, and adult dispersal probability reveal heterogeneity on various spatial scales, with adult movement explaining a larger component of variation than spatial position or larval dispersal. Results of this study support the idea that red snapper in the GOM display metapopulation structure, but also suggest a potential genetic discontinuity along the West Florida Shelf not previously described. The approach of using landscape genomics and dispersal data (larval and/or adult) to better understand metapopulation dynamics is promising for not only red snapper, but also for other marine species that occupy a diversity of habitats and are seemingly distributed continuously. © 2021 The Author(s).","adult movement; landscape genetics; larval dispersal; Lutjanus campechanus; next-generation sequencing","dispersal; genetic variation; genomics; heterogeneity; metapopulation; population distribution; population structure; Atlantic Coast [North America]; Atlantic Coast [United States]; Atlantic Ocean; Gulf of Mexico; United States; West Florida Shelf",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus

A challenge for larvae of coastal species is to return to coastal nursery habitats. Shore crab (Carcinus maenas L.) larvae are known to show tidal rhythmicity in vertical migration in tidal areas and circadian rhythmicity in microtidal areas, which seems to increase successful coastal settlement. We studied genome-wide differentiation based on 24,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms of 12 native populations of shore crab sampled from a large tidal amplitude gradient from macrotidal (~8 m) to microtidal (~0.2 m). Dispersal and recruitment success of larvae was assessed with a Lagrangian biophysical model, which showed a strong effect of larval behaviour on long-term connectivity, and dispersal barriers that partly coincided with different tidal environments. The genetic population structure showed a subdivision of the samples into three clusters, which represent micro-, meso- and macrotidal areas. The genetic differentiation was mostly driven by 0.5% outlier loci, which showed strong allelic clines located at the limits between the three tidal areas. Demographic modelling suggested that the two genetic barriers have different origins. Differential gene expression of two clock genes (cyc and pdp1) further highlighted phenotypic differences among genetic clusters that are potentially linked to the differences in larval behaviour. Taken together, our seascape genomic study suggests that tidal regime acts as a strong selection force on shore crab population structure, consistent with larval behaviour affecting dispersal and recruitment success. © 2022 The Authors.

Yellow mangrove (Bruguiera parviflora) belongs to the Rhizophoraceae family and is widely distributed in the intertidal zones along sheltered coastal areas in tropical latitudes. Here, we present a high-quality, chromosome-level assembly of the B. parviflora genome. We employed the 10x Genomics linked-read technology to obtain a preliminary assembly, which was subsequently scaffolded using the long-range chromatin contact mapping technique (HiC) to obtain a final assembly containing 213,026,782 bases in 10,045 scaffolds with an N50 length of 10,906,948 bases. Our gene prediction recovered 96.5% of the highly conserved orthologues in the Embryophyta lineage based on the Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologues (BUSCO) analysis. We analysed the transversion rate at fourfold-degenerate sites from orthologous gene pairs and discovered evidence supporting a recent whole-genome duplication event in B. parviflora and other Rhizophoreae members. Comparative studies based on single-copy orthologous genes indicated that B. parviflora and Bruguiera gymnorrhiza diverged approximately 24.1 million years ago. The population structure analysis revealed that 63 B. parviflora accessions from different geographical regions in Thailand were an admixture of two subpopulations. The examination of alternative splicing events in B. parviflora showed that the most prevalent splicing mechanism was intron retention.

A. salmonicida strains are classified as typical or atypical depending on their origin of isolation and phenotype. Five subspecies have been described, where A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida is the only typical subspecies, and the subsp. achromogenes, masoucida, smithia, and pectinolytica are considered atypical. Genomic differences between A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida isolates and their relationship with the current classification have not been explored. Here, we sequenced and compared the complete closed genomes of four virulent strains to elucidate their molecular diversity and pathogenic evolution using the more accurate genomic information so far. Phenotypes, biochemical, and enzymatic profiles were determined. PacBio and MiSeq sequencing platforms were utilized for genome sequencing. Comparative genomics showed that atypical strains belong to the subsp. salmonicida, with 99.55% ± 0.25% identity with each other, and are closely related to typical strains. The typical strain A. salmonicida J223 is closely related to typical strains, with 99.17% identity with the A. salmonicida A449. Genomic differences between atypical and typical strains are strictly related to insertion sequences (ISs) activity. The absence and presence of genes encoding for virulence factors, transcriptional regulators, and non-coding RNAs are the most significant differences between typical and atypical strains that affect their phenotypes. Plasmidome plays an important role in A. salmonicida virulence and genome plasticity. Here, we determined that typical strains harbor a larger number of plasmids and virulence-related genes that contribute to its acute virulence. In contrast, atypical strains harbor a single, large plasmid and a smaller number of virulence genes, reflected by their less acute virulence and chronic infection. The relationship between phenotype and A. salmonicida subspecies’ taxonomy is not evident. Comparative genomic analysis based on completed genomes revealed that the subspecies classification is more of a reflection of the ecological niche occupied by bacteria than their divergences at the genomic level except for their accessory genome. © 2022 by the authors.

However, insufficient attention has been given to understanding how neutral and adaptive genetic variation are partitioned within and among proximal natural populations, and the patterns and drivers of gene flow over small spatial scales, which can be important for restoration success. A seascape genomics approach was used to investigate population structure, local adaptation, and the extent to which environmental gradients influence genetic variation among natural and restored populations of Chesapeake Bay eastern oysters Crassostrea virginica. We also investigated the impact of hatchery practices on neutral genetic diversity of restored reefs and quantified the broader genetic impacts of large-scale hatchery-based bivalve restoration. Restored reefs showed similar levels of diversity as natural reefs, and striking relationships were found between planting frequency and broodstock numbers and genetic diversity metrics (effective population size and relatedness), suggesting that hatchery practices can have a major impact on diversity. Despite long-term restoration activities, haphazard historical translocations, and high dispersal potential of larvae that could homogenize allele frequencies among populations, moderate neutral population genetic structure was uncovered. Moreover, environmental factors, namely salinity, pH, and temperature, play a major role in the distribution of neutral and adaptive genetic variation. For marine invertebrates in heterogeneous seascapes, collecting broodstock from large populations experiencing similar environments to candidate sites may provide the most appropriate sources for restoration and ensure population resilience in the face of rapid environmental change. This is one of a few studies to demonstrate empirically that hatchery practices have a major impact on the retention of genetic diversity. Overall, these results contribute to the growing body of evidence for fine-scale genetic structure and local adaptation in broadcast-spawning marine species and provide novel information for the management of an important fisheries resource. © 2021 The Authors.

The viability of remnant populations remains uncertain and could be impacted by continued fishing and by-catch pressure, and the projected impacts of climate change. We genotyped 503 samples of D. batis, obtained opportunistically from the widest available geographic range, across 6 350 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using a reduced-representation sequencing approach. Genotypes were used to assess the species’ contemporary population structure, estimate effective population sizes and identify putative signals of selection in relation to environmental variables using a seascape genomics approach. We identified genetic discontinuities between inshore (British Isles) and offshore (Rockall and Faroe Island) populations, with differentiation most pronounced across the deep waters of the Rockall Trough. Effective population sizes were largest in the Celtic Sea and Rockall, but low enough to be of potential conservation concern among Scottish and Faroese sites. Among the 21 candidate SNPs under positive selection was one significantly correlated with environmental variables predicted to be affected by climate change, including bottom temperature, salinity and pH. The paucity of well-annotated elasmobranch genomes precluded us from identifying a putative function for this SNP. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that climate change could inflict a strong selective force upon remnant populations of D. batis, further constraining its already-restricted habitat. Furthermore, the results provide fundamental insights on the distribution, behaviour and evolutionary biology of D. batis in the North-East Atlantic that will be useful for the establishment of conservation actions for this and other critically endangered elasmobranchs. © 2021 The Authors.

This multi-disciplinary body will be dedicated to mitigate governance issues associated with the digitization of genetic resources. Solving the DSI conundrum is sorely needed given the forthcoming multilateral meetings of the Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS) framework (the next CBD COP is scheduled in 2021) that are central to tackle the global loss of biodiversity, global warming, pandemic risk and food insecurity. Summary: Contemporary research is increasingly data-centric and the rise of genomics revolutionized our approach and use of genetic resources. However, genomics developed relatively independently from the international instruments on the conservation of biological diversity, in particular the Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS) framework. The legal and political status of Digital Sequence Information (DSI) derived from genetic resources emerged recently as a contentious point in the various ABS instruments dealing with genetic resources. In view of the multiple parallel and uncoordinated debates that occurred in various forums dealing with plants, animals, terrestrial, microbial, marine and agricultural biodiversity, we propose here to take a step back in the discussion. We argue that DSI should be considered as an overarching issue to be addressed through a coordinated and inclusive Multi-stakeholder Committee that would assess its position and role within the existing ABS regime complex. This Multi-stakeholder Committee on the Governance of Digital Sequence Information, that may run under the auspices of the United Nations, will be dedicated to mitigate global governance issues associated with the digitization of genetic resources. In this paper, we sketch this body as a transversal and inclusive tool to facilitate long-term coherence in all ABS policy forums. © 2021 The Author/s, Plants, People, Planet © New Phytologist Foundation","access and benefit sharing; biodiversity; committee; Digital Sequence Information (DSI); genomics; plant genetic resources; Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (PGRFA)",,Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

The geographic proximity of the islands suggests the possibility for successful dispersal, but this is countered by the permanence of the marine barriers and extreme intervening currents that are expected to hinder gene flow. Phylogenetic and species delimitation analyses of flying lizards (genus Draco) using single mitochondrial genes, complete mitochondrial genomes, and exome-capture data sets identified 9-11 deeply divergent lineages including single-island endemics, lineages that span multiple islands, and parapatrically distributed nonsister lineages on the larger islands. Population clustering and PCA confirmed these genetic boundaries with isolation-by-distance playing a role in some islands or island sets. While gdi estimates place most candidate species comparisons in the ambiguous zone, migration estimates suggest 9 or 10 species exist with nuclear introgression detected across some intra-island contact zones. Initial entry of Draco into the archipelago occurred at 5.5-7.5 Ma, with most inter-island colonization events having occurred between 1-3 Ma. Biogeographical model testing favors scenarios integrating geographic distance and historical island connectivity, including an initial stepping-stone dispersal process from the Greater Sunda Shelf through the Sunda Arc as far eastward as Lembata Island. However, rather than reaching the adjacent island of Pantar by dispersing over the 15-km wide Alor Strait, Draco ultimately reached Pantar (and much of the rest of the archipelago) by way of a circuitous route involving at least five overwater dispersal events. These findings suggest that historical geological and oceanographic conditions heavily influenced dispersal pathways and gene flow, which in turn drove species formation and shaped species boundaries.

However, we later discovered that the medium of our culture system contains not only coral cells, but also other contaminating organisms. The RNA-seq data therefore included sequences of organisms other than Acropora tenuis. As a consequence, the data did not always support the coral origin of IVB5 line cells. Therefore, we have withdrawn these transcriptome-related data. Instead, we present experimental results of immunocytochemistry to show in vitro symbiosis of reef-building coral cells with photosynthetic dinoflagellates more clearly. The following corrections have been made: 1. Materials and Methods, Immunocytochemistry with Antibodies Specific to Acropora tenuis, paragraph one has been replaced with: “In a previous study, we made two rabbit antibodies against synthetic oligopeptides, one corresponding to a part of A. tenuis Snail protein (a zinc finger transcriptional repressor) and the other to a part of A. tenuis Fat1 protein (a Fat-like cadherin-related tumor suppressor homolog) (for details, see Kawamura et al., 2021). To confirm that cells of the IVB5 line that engulfed algae are of A. tenuis, we carried out immunocytochemistry using the antibodies. Cultured cells suspended in the culture medium were centrifuged at 300 x g for 5min and resuspended in phosphatebuffered salt solution (PBS). Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15min in an ice bath. After quenching with 200mM glycine for 2min and permeabilizing with 0.1% Triton X- 100 for 10min, cells were incubated in a mixture of 0.25% blocking reagent (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and 5% skim milk in PBS for 30min. Then, they were reacted with the rabbit primary antibody diluted 400-fold with PBS for 1 h and with goat antirabbit secondary antibody labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (Vector Laboratory, Burlingame, CA, USA) diluted 200- fold with PBS for 30min. After washing by centrifugation for 5min twice with PBS, cells were counterstained with 4 ′ ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). They were observed by means of a confocal microscopy system (ECLIPSE C1si, Nikon Co. LTD., Tokyo, Japan).” 2. Results, Acropora tenuis IVB5-Line Cells, paragraphs 1–3 have been replaced with: “IVB5 is one of 20 cryo-reserved cell lines established from A. tenuis planula larvae in 2020 (Figure 1A). After replating the culture line several times, cells were frozen in 2-mL serum tubes in liquid nitrogen for permanent preservation. A few months later, cells in a tube were melted back into culture medium to proliferate as the original line of cells did (Figure 1A). Although the IVB5 line is polyclonal and contains several types of cells with different morphologies, the majority are dark, flattened, amorphous cells, 20∼30μm in length (Figure 1A). The line also contains a few brilliant cells (Figure 1A) and small elongated cells (Figure 1A). A large vacuole (Figure 1B1, B3) and several small vesicles (Figure 1B1, B2) are found in the cytoplasmof flattened amorphous cells. They extend lamellipodia and sometimes filopodia as well (Figure 1B2, B3) and show moderate locomotor activity (Supplementary Movie 1). Using immunocytochemistry, we examined dark, flattened, amorphous cells that did not engulf symbiotic dinoflagellates (Supplementary Figure 1A) and cells that did (Supplementary Figures 1B, 1C). Although the former maintained their flattened, amorphous morphology, the latter became spherical (described later). Both showed distinct fluorescent signals in response to A. tenuis-specific antibodies (Supplementary Figures 1A-1C). In the case of anti-AtSnail, signals were restricted to the nucleus (Supplementary Figure 1C), while in the case of anti-AtFat1, fluorescent signals appeared throughout the entire cell bodies (Supplementary Figures 1A, 1B). In contrast, negative control cells that were stained with non-immunized rabbit serum did not exhibit FITC signals, but confirmed DAPI signals (Supplementary Figure 1D). These results indicate that cells of the IVB5 line that engulfed symbiotic algae are of Acropora tenuis.” 3. Results, The Dinoflagellate, Breviolum minutum, paragraph one have been replaced with: Breviolum minutum “(Figures 1C,D) has been maintained in our laboratories for 8 years. During the proliferation stage, brown cells appear globular, approximately 8μm in diameter, do not extend flagella, and show no locomotor activity. On the other hand, during steady state, some algal cells extend flagellae and swim in the culture medium. The B. minutum genome has been sequenced (Shoguchi et al., 2013). The identity of B. minutum used in this study was identified by partial genome sequence to be strain ITS2-type B1 (Supplementary Figure 2).” 4. Results, Occurrence of in vitro Symbiosis of Coral Cells With Dinoflagellates, paragraphs 1-2 have been replaced with: “A 200–250-μL drop of culture medium containing B. minutum was added to each well of a 24-well multiplate that contained subconfluent coral cells in approximately 1mL of growthmedium. Most immobilized B.minutumgradually settled at the bottom of the culture plate wells after 5 or 6min. The first change detected after mixing animal and algal cells was increased locomotor activity of flattened amorphous cells. Immediately after mixing, coral cells developed filopodia and actively extended and retracted pseudopodia (Figures 1C,D,E1, arrows). They crept faster than those in plates that lacked dinoflagellates (Supplementary Movie 1). Interactions between cells of the two taxa occurred shortly after mixing (Figure 1C), followed by coral cell phagocytosis of dinoflagellates (Figure 1D). Coral cells incorporated coccoid cells, but not thecate motile cells. One day after mixing, one or two and sometimes three dinoflagellates were found in the cytoplasmof individual cultured coral cells (Figure 1E1, E2).We repeated experiments more than five times and obtained the same results, indicating that this in vitro symbiosis is reproducible. We examined whether the culture medium affects the interaction between coral and dinoflagellate cells. Three media, the conditioned cell growth medium that had been used for cell culture for 2 weeks or more, newly prepared cell growth medium, and basic seawater medium, were examined. One day after inoculation in the conditioned medium, 50.2 ± 30.2% (number of observation fields, n = 12, which contained approximately 20 cells) of cultured host cells incorporated algae (Supplementary Figure 3A). In newly prepared growth medium, algal uptake was observed in 45.7 ± 28.8% (n = 14) of all cells (Supplementary Figure 3B), and in seawater medium, 45.5 ± 30.3% (n = 7) (Supplementary Figure 3C). These results indicate that 1 day after inoculation, coral cell symbiosis with algal cells occurred similarly in each of the three media in approximately 50% of the cultured coral cells. Several days after mixing, coral cells did not show further incorporation of dinoflagellates. Even when dinoflagellates were present near or attached to coral cells, they appeared to show no interest in dinoflagellates.” 5. The Data Availability Statement should have been removed. 6.

In marine systems, determining the scale, rate, and directionality of larval dispersal is therefore, central to understanding how coral metapopulations are interconnected and the degree of resiliency in the event of a localized disturbance. Understanding these source-sink dynamics is essential to guide restoration efforts and for the study of ecology and evolution in the ocean. The patterns and mechanisms of connectivity in the deep-sea (>200 m deep) are largely understudied. In this study, we investigated the spatial diversity patterns and metapopulation connectivity of the octocoral Paramuricea biscaya throughout the northern Gulf of Mexico (GoM). Paramuricea biscaya is one of the most abundant corals on the lower continental slope (between 1,200 and 2,500 m) in the GoM. The 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill (DWH) directly impacted populations of this species and thus are considered primary targets for restoration. We used a combination of seascape genomic analyses, high-resolution ocean circulation modeling, and larval dispersal simulations to quantify the degree of population structuring and connectivity among P. biscaya populations. Evidence supports the hypotheses that the genetic diversity of P. biscaya is structured by depth, and that larval dispersal among connected populations is asymmetric due to dominant ocean circulation patterns. Our results suggest that there are intermediate unsampled populations in the central GoM that serve as stepping stones for dispersal. The data suggest that the DeSoto Canyon area, and possibly the West Florida Escarpment, critically act as sources of larvae for areas impacted by the DWH oil spill in the Mississippi Canyon. This work illustrates that the management of deep-sea marine protected areas should incorporate knowledge of connectivity networks and depth-dependent processes throughout the water column.

Biological communities inhabiting these ecosystems are often distributed in widely separated habitats, raising intriguing questions on how these organisms achieve connectivity and whether habitat types facilitate intraspecific divergence. The deep-sea patellogastropod limpet Bathyacmaea nipponica that colonizes both vents and seeps across ∼2,400 km in the Northwest Pacific is a feasible model to answer these questions. We analyzed 123 individuals from four vents and three seeps using a comprehensive method incorporating population genomics and physical ocean modeling. Genome survey sequencing and genotyping-by-sequencing resulted in 9,838 single-nucleotide polymorphisms for population genomic analyses. Genetic divergence and demographic analyses revealed four habitat-linked (i.e., three seep and one vent) genetic groups, with the vent genetic group established via the opportunistic invasion of a few limpet larvae from a nearby seep genetic group. TreeMix analysis uncovered three historical seep-to-vent migration events. ADMIXTURE and divMigrate analyses elucidated weak contemporary gene flow from a seep genetic group to the vent genetic group. Physical ocean modeling underlined the potential roles of seafloor topography and ocean currents in shaping the genetic connectivity, contemporary migration, and local hybridization of these deep-sea limpets. Our study highlighted the power of integrating genomic and oceanographic approaches in deciphering the demography and diversification of deep-sea organisms. Given the increasing anthropogenic activities (e.g., mining and gas hydrate extraction) affecting the deep ocean, our results have implications for the conservation of deep-sea biodiversity and establishment of marine protected areas. © The Author(s) 2021.

Metal bioaccumulation and parasitic diseases could vary in different species depending on temperature changes and other environmental factors. Most studies conducted on endoparasites, such as acanthocephalans, cestodes, nematodes, and trematodes, indicate that only cestodes and acanthocephalans could absorb heavy metals successfully in their hosts, and that only adult worms could be used as indicators of environmental pollution. In Artemia parthenogenetica, cestodes increased resistance to arsenic (As) pollution and temperature changes; and infection was associated with improved antioxidant defense system without oxidative damage. The most serious parasite of Penaeus spp. is Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (Microsporidia: Enterocytozoonidae). Apostome ciliates are negatively impacting Pandalus borealis of the northeastern United States (Synophrya sp. that causes ""white eggs"" or Black Spot Gill Syndrome) and Penaeus spp. from the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico (Hyalophysa lynni that causes shrimp black gill). In freshwater fish, the larvae of the nematode Eustrongylides spp. Jägerskiöld, 1909 (Nematoda: Dioctophymidae) absorbed lead (Pb), mercury, and cadmium, when the metal levels were close to zero in water and sediment. The concentration of Pb in the larvae was approximately 17 times higher than in the fish. Like the antioxidant defense reactions in the parasitized A. parthenogenetica exposed to As, an improved antioxidant defense system may be available in parasitized fish, limiting oxidative damage caused by metals. This study presents baseline concentrations of 30 metals in wild Penaeus vannamei Boone, 1931 from Ecuador and other species, as well as the current taxonomy for selected shellfish species and their parasites. Research is needed to assess the relationship of metals in parasites and host tissues, and oxidative stress in shellfish. The tools of One Health including molecular ecology, population genomics, proteomics, and epigenetic epidemiology should be used to detect parasites and environmental pollution indicators that could threaten aquatic species from freshwater and marine ecosystems, particularly considering climate change and pollution threats. © 2021 National Shellfisheries Association.

Their fat metabolism may differ from that of other mammals because toothed whales have acoustic fats. Gene expression in the metabolic pathways of animals can change with respect to their evolution and environment. A real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a reliable technique for studying the relative expressions of genes. However, since the accuracy of RT-qPCR data is totally dependent on the reference gene, the selection of the reference gene is an essential step. In this study, 10 candidate reference genes (ZC3H10, FTL, LGALS1, RPL27, GAPDH, FTH1, DCN, TCTP, NDUS5, and UBIM) were initially tested for amplification efficiency using RT-qPCR. After excluding DCN, the remaining nine genes, which are nearly 100% efficient, were selected for the gene stability analysis. Stable reference genes across eight different fat tissue, liver, and muscle samples from Grampus griseus were identified by four algorithms, which were provided in Genorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and Delta CT. Finally, a RefFinder comprehensive ranking was performed based on the stability values, and the nine genes were ranked as follows: LGALS1 > FTL > GAPDH > ZC3H10 > FTH1 > NDUS5 > TCTP > RPL27 > UBIM. The LGALS1 and FTL genes were identified as the most stable novel reference genes. The third-ranked gene, GAPDH, is a well-known housekeeping gene for mammals. Ultimately, we suggest the use of LGALS1 as a reliable novel reference gene for genomics studies on the lipid-related aquatic adaptations of toothed whales. © 2021 The Authors.

Strikingly, the analysis of 43 single-cell genomes shows that Picozoa belong to Archaeplastida, specifically related to red algae and the phagotrophic rhodelphids. These picozoan genomes support the hypothesis that Picozoa lack a plastid, and further reveal no evidence of an early cryptic endosymbiosis with cyanobacteria.

Platynereis is used as a model for genetics, regeneration, reproduction biology, development, evolution, chronobiology, neurobiology, ecology, ecotoxicology, and most recently also for connectomics and single-cell genomics. Research on the Nereid started with studies on eye development and spiralian embryogenesis in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Transitioning into the molecular era, Platynereis research focused on posterior growth and regeneration, neuroendocrinology, circadian and lunar cycles, fertilization, and oocyte maturation. Other work covered segmentation, photoreceptors and other sensory cells, nephridia, and population dynamics. Most recently, the unique advantages of the Nereid young worm for whole-body volume electron microscopy and single-cell sequencing became apparent, enabling the tracing of all neurons in its rope-ladder-like central nervous system, and the construction of multimodal cellular atlases. Here, we provide an overview of current topics and methodologies for P. dumerilii, with the aim of stimulating further interest into our unique model and expanding the active and vibrant Platynereis community. © 2021, The Author(s).","Annelida; Evo-devo; Integrative biology; Marine model species; Spiralia",,Review,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

This study characterizes the genomes of three marine fungi: Emericellopsis sp. TS7, wood-associated Amylocarpus encephaloides and algae-associated Calycina marina. These species were genome sequenced to study their genomic features, biosynthetic potential and phylogenetic placement using multilocus data. Amylocarpus encephaloides and C. marina were placed in the Helotiaceae and Pezizellaceae (Helotiales), respectively, based on a 15-gene phylogenetic analysis. These two genomes had fewer biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) than Emericellopsis sp. TS7 isolate. Emericellopsis sp. TS7 (Hypocreales, Ascomycota) was isolated from the sponge Stelletta normani. A six-gene phylogenetic analysis placed the isolate in the marine Emericellopsis clade and morphological examination confirmed that the isolate represents a new species, which is described here as E. atlantica. Analysis of its CAZyme repertoire and a culturing experiment on three marine and one terrestrial substrates indicated that E. atlantica is a psychrotrophic generalist fungus that is able to degrade several types of marine biomass. FungiSMASH analysis revealed the presence of 35 BGCs including, eight non-ribosomal peptide synthases (NRPSs), six NRPS-like, six polyketide synthases, nine terpenes and six hybrid, mixed or other clusters. Of these BGCs, only five were homologous with characterized BGCs. The presence of unknown BGCs sets and large CAZyme repertoire set stage for further investigations of E. atlantica. The Pezizellaceae genome and the genome of the monotypic Amylocarpus genus represent the first published genomes of filamentous fungi that are restricted in their occurrence to the marine habitat and form thus a valuable resource for the community that can be used in studying ecological adaptions of fungi using comparative genomics. © 2021, The Author(s).","1 new taxon; Bioprospecting; Genome mining; Illumina; Lignocellulolytic enzymes; Physiology; Taxonomy",,Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Unlike other marine shrimps, the ovaries in adult female M. nipponense can mature rapidly and periodically during the reproductive period, but the resulting high stocking densities and environmental deterioration can negatively impact the harvest yield and economic benefits. To better understand ovary development in female M. nipponense, we performed systematic transcriptome sequencing of five different stages of ovarian maturation. Results: We obtained 255,966 Gb of high quality transcriptome data from 15 samples. Of the 105,082 unigenes that were selected, 30,878 were successfully annotated. From these unigenes, we identified 17 differentially expressed genes and identified three distinct gene expression patterns related to different biological processes. We found that cathepins, legumains, and cystatin were enriched in the lysosome pathway, and they are related to vitellogenin hydrolysis. Additionally, we found that myosin heavy chain 67 participated in oocyte excretion. Conclusions: We provide the first detailed transcriptome data relating to the ovarian maturation cycle in M. nipponense. Our results provide important reference information about the genomics, molecular biology, physiology, and population genetics of M. nipponense and other crustaceans.

However, a lack of genomic resources and challenges associated with collecting high-quality RNA can limit its application for many wild populations. Minimally invasive blood sampling combined with de novo transcriptomic approaches has great potential to alleviate these barriers. Here, we advance these goals for marine turtles by generating high quality de novo blood transcriptome assemblies to characterize functional diversity and compare global transcriptional profiles between tissues, species, and foraging aggregations. Results: We generated high quality blood transcriptome assemblies for hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata), loggerhead (Caretta caretta), green (Chelonia mydas), and leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea) turtles. The functional diversity in assembled blood transcriptomes was comparable to those from more traditionally sampled tissues. A total of 31.3% of orthogroups identified were present in all four species, representing a core set of conserved genes expressed in blood and shared across marine turtle species. We observed strong species-specific expression of these genes, as well as distinct transcriptomic profiles between green turtle foraging aggregations that inhabit areas of greater or lesser anthropogenic disturbance. Conclusions: Obtaining global gene expression data through non-lethal, minimally invasive sampling can greatly expand the applications of RNA-sequencing in protected long-lived species such as marine turtles. The distinct differences in gene expression signatures between species and foraging aggregations provide insight into the functional genomics underlying the diversity in this ancient vertebrate lineage.

Fibropapillomatosis is an expanding virally and environmentally co-induced sea turtle tumor epizootic. Chelonid herpesvirus 5 (ChHV5) is implicated as a causative virus, but its transmission method and specific role in oncogenesis and progression is unclear. We applied environmental (e)DNA-based viral monitoring to assess viral shedding as a direct means of transmission, and the relationship between tumor burden, surgical resection and ChHV5 shedding. To elucidate the abundance and transcriptional status of ChHV5 across early, established, regrowth and internal tumors we conducted genomics and transcriptomics. We determined that ChHV5 is shed into the water column, representing a likely transmission route, and revealed novel temporal shedding dynamics and tumor burden correlations. ChHV5 was more abundant in the water column than in marine leeches. We also revealed that ChHV5 is latent in fibropapillomatosis, including early stage, regrowth and internal tumors; higher viral transcription is not indicative of poor patient outcome, and high ChHV5 loads predominantly arise from latent virus. These results expand our knowledge of the cellular and shedding dynamics of ChHV5 and can provide insights into temporal transmission dynamics and viral oncogenesis not readily investigable in tumors of terrestrial species. © 2021, The Author(s).",,"DNA; animal; carcinogenesis; environmental monitoring; genetics; genomics; Herpesviridae; leech; papilloma; pathogenicity; procedures; skin tumor; turtle; verruca vulgaris; veterinary medicine; virology; virus shedding; Animals; Carcinogenesis; DNA; Environmental DNA; Environmental Monitoring; Genomics; Herpesviridae; Leeches; Papilloma; Skin Neoplasms; Turtles; Virus Shedding; Warts",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Despite its well-known hydrology and physicochemical features, this enormous water mass remains poorly studied at the microbial genomics level. Results: We have sampled its different water masses and analyzed the microbiome by shotgun and genome-resolved metagenomics, generating a large number of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from them. We found various similarities with previously described Black Sea metagenomic datasets, that show remarkable stability in its microbiome. Our datasets are also comparable to other marine anoxic water columns like the Cariaco Basin. The oxic zone resembles to standard marine (e.g. Mediterranean) photic zones, with Cyanobacteria (Synechococcus but a conspicuously absent Prochlorococcus), and photoheterotrophs domination (largely again with marine relatives). The chemocline presents very different characteristics from the oxic surface with many examples of chemolithotrophic metabolism (Thioglobus) and facultatively anaerobic microbes. The euxinic anaerobic zone presents, as expected, features in common with the bottom of meromictic lakes with a massive dominance of sulfate reduction as energy-generating metabolism, a few (but detectable) methanogenesis marker genes, and a large number of “dark matter” streamlined genomes of largely unpredictable ecology. Conclusions: The Black Sea oxic zone presents many similarities to the global ocean while the redoxcline and euxinic water masses have similarities to other similar aquatic environments of marine (Cariaco Basin or other Black Sea regions) or freshwater (meromictic monimolimnion strata) origin. The MAG collection represents very well the different types of metabolisms expected in this kind of environment.

In this context, it is crucial to gather biological and ecological information of the main species in marine communities to predict and mitigate potential effects of shifts in their distribution, abundance, and interactions. Using genotyping by sequencing (GBS), we assessed the genetic structure of a keystone species in the Mediterranean shallow littoral ecosystems, the black sea urchin Arbacia lixula. This bioengineer species can shape their communities due to its grazing activity and it is experiencing an ongoing expansion with increasing temperatures. The population genomic analyses on 5,241 loci sequenced in 240 individuals from 11 Mediterranean sampled populations revealed that all populations were diverse and showed significant departure from equilibrium. Albeit genetic differentiation was in general shallow, a significant break separated the western and eastern Mediterranean populations, a break not detected in previous studies with less resolutive markers. Notably, no clear effect of the Almería-Oran front, an important break in the Atlanto-Mediterranean transition, could be detected among the western basin populations, where only a slight differentiation of the two northernmost populations was found. Despite the generally low levels of genetic differentiation found, we identified candidate regions for local adaptation by combining different genomic analysis with environmental data. Salinity, rather than temperature, seemed to be an important driver of genetic structure in A. lixula. Overall, from a population genomics standpoint, there is ample scope for A. lixula to continue thriving and adapting in the warming Mediterranean.

Only a handful of these viruses have been genomically characterized, limiting our appreciation of their ecological impacts and evolution. Here, we present 37 new genomes of haloarchaeal tailed virus isolates, more than doubling the current number of sequenced arTVs. Analysis of all 63 available complete genomes of arTVs, which we propose to classify into 14 new families and 3 orders, suggests ancient divergence of archaeal and bacterial tailed viruses and points to an extensive sharing of genes involved in DNA metabolism and counter defense mechanisms, illuminating common strategies of virus-host interactions with tailed bacteriophages. Coupling of the comparative genomics with the host range analysis on a broad panel of haloarchaeal species uncovered 4 distinct groups of viral tail fiber adhesins controlling the host range expansion. The survey of metagenomes using viral hallmark genes suggests that the global architecture of the arTV community is shaped through recurrent transfers between different biomes, including hypersaline, marine, and anoxic environments.

To better understand their evolution, we generated the first chromosome-level genomes of two representative Hydrophiini snakes, Hydrophis cyanocinctus and H. curtus. Through comparative genomics we identified a great expansion of the underwater olfaction-related V2R gene family, consisting of more than 1,000 copies in both snakes. A series of chromosome rearrangements and genomic structural variations were recognized, including large inversions longer than 30 megabase (Mb) on sex chromosomes which potentially affect key functional genes associated with differentiated phenotypes between the two species. By integrating multiomics we found a significant loss of the major weapon for elapid predation, three-finger toxin genes, which displayed a dosage effect in H. curtus. These genetic changes may imply mechanisms that drove the divergent evolution of adaptive traits including prey preferences between the two closely related snakes.

In this study, in silico comparative genomics between UV filters sensitive and resistant bacteria were conducted in order to unravel the genes responsible for a resistance phenotype. The genomes of two environmentally relevant Bacteroidetes and three Firmicutes species were compared through pairwise comparison. Larger genomes were carried by bacteria exhibiting a resistant phenotype, favoring their ability to adapt to environmental stresses. While the antitoxin and CRISPR systems were the only distinctive features in resistant Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes displayed multiple unique genes that could support the difference between sensitive and resistant phenotypes. Several genes involved in ROS response, vitamin biosynthesis, xenobiotic degradation, multidrug resistance, and lipophilic compound permeability were shown to be exclusive to resistant species. Our investigation contributes to a better understanding of UV filters resistance phenotypes, by identifying pivotal genes involved in key pathways.

However, only a few time series survive for more than a decade. RADIALES is one of the longest multidisciplinary programs in operation in the northern and northwestern coast of Spain. In the last 30 years, this program collected monthly data on physical, chemical and plankton observations in an array of five sections of stations representative of upwelling and stratified dynamics. Here, the main achievements, including key contributions to ecosystem conservation policies, are summarized. The development of this program, in line with similar initiatives in other countries, included phases focused on the study of seasonality, on comparative analysis, and lately on the analysis of decadal variability and regime shifts. Furthermore, in recent years there was a substantial improvement in the identification of plankton species by genomics. Among the main findings of RADIALES are the quantification of ocean warming at subsurface layers, the determination of climatologies in thermohaline, biogeochemical and biological variables, the inventory of plankton species (from bacteria to zooplankton) and the identification of regionally coherent regime shifts. Baselines defined by RADIALES series were instrumental for the assessment of environmental impacts (e.g. oil spills) and for the support of environmental policies (e.g. Marine Strategy Framework Directive). By contributing to international databases, data from programs as RADIALES combined with new instrumental observations will help to develop a more coherent and comprehensive understanding of the ocean ecosystems, enhancing our ability to detect and forecast risks. © 2021","Baselines; Hydrography; N-NW Spain; Ocean climate; Plankton; Ship-based observations; Time-series; Trends","Decision making; Ecosystems; Environmental protection; Marine biology; Marine pollution; Oceanography; Oil spills; Plankton; Ships; Baseline; N-NW spain; North Atlantic; NW Spain; Ocean climate; Ocean observations; Regime shift; Ship-based observation; Times series; Trend; Time series; bacterium; coastal zone management; conservation planning; decadal variation; decision making; environmental impact; observational method; plankton; time series analysis; zooplankton; Atlantic Coast [Europe]; Atlantic Coast [Spain]; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Spain",Review,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus

They play a vital role in the ocean by driving the circulation of matter and the flow of energy via the absorption of considerable amounts of carbon dioxide and the release of dissolved organic matter. This dissolved organic matter is converted into biomass by marine heterotrophs, which keeps the cycling of elements in oligotrophic waters at equilibrium. Prochlorococcus, an ecologically important genus of cyanobacteria, is the smallest and most abundant oxygenic phototroph in the global ocean. Prochlorococcus has highly streamlined genomes, which can provide a competitive advantage in the oligotrophic surface waters; however, the streamlined genomes also force Prochlorococcus to adapt to a narrow range of environmental parameters. Owing to these genomic characteristics, Prochlorococcus often establishes interactions with heterotrophic bacteria to survive in the challenging marine environment. Because cyanobacteria are abundant in the ocean, the cyanobacteria-heterotrophic bacteria relationship can significantly affect marine carbon sequestration and storage, which in turn has important ecological implications. Previous studies have reported on the relationships between Prochlorococcus and various heterotrophic bacteria. For example, Prochlorococcus establishes positive interactions with Alteromonas sp. that enhance its growth rate and environmental adaptability. In this review, we discuss the underlying mechanisms of the interaction patterns between Prochlorococcus and heterotrophic bacteria, as well as their genetic, physiological, and ecological significance. Prochlorococcus and heterotrophic bacteria tend to form mutualistic relationships in which they directly or indirectly exchange metabolites or recycle organic carbon through complementary excretion and crosstalk between pathways, such as citrate, glycolate, and malate pathways. Prochlorococcus and heterotrophic bacteria also commonly establish commensal relationships. For instance, heterotrophic bacteria protect Prochlorococcus by scavenging hydrogen peroxide, which Prochlorococcus is sensitive to. Although many heterotrophic bacteria cannot synthesize vitamin B12, they require it as a cofactor for essential functions. Their genetic characteristics suggest that most cyanobacteria have the pathways for synthesizing vitamin B12, but that they may provide vitamin B12 to heterotrophic bacteria to promote the growth of ""helper"" in the oligotrophic ocean. Therefore, the interactions between cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria help maintain the stability and diversity of marine ecosystems. Global climate change may influence cyanobacteria-heterotrophic bacteria interactions, which could directly affect the structure and dynamics of the microbial community in the oligotrophic ocean, and therefore, primary productivity and element cycling in the ocean. Here, we suggest future research priorities and potential applications based on newfound knowledge of the subject. First, using the known ""heterotrophic bacteria-cyanobacteria"" relationships, the cultivation of marine heterotrophic bacteria, cyanobacteria and their viruses should be promoted to build a more comprehensive ""cyanobacteria-heterotrophic bacteria-virus"" ecological model for marine environments. Second, the interaction mechanisms between cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria should be revealed by new biotechnologies, such as (meta) genomics, (meta) transcriptomics, (meta) proteomics, and (meta) metabolomics.Third, cyanobacteria-heterotrophic bacteria interactions should be studied against the backdrop of climate change using both ex situ (i.e., laboratory) and in situ investigations to predict changes in marine microbial community and its potential impact on biogeochemical cycling in oceans. © 2021, Science Press.

Microorganisms play a dominant role in global biogeochemical cycles crucial for a planet's sustainability. Since microbial communities are highly dependent on the temperature factor, fluctuations in the same will lead to adverse effects on the microbial community organization. Throughout the Ocean, increase in evaporation rates causes the surface mixed layer to become shallower. This intensified stratification inhibits vertical transport of nutrient supplies. Such density driven processes will decrease oxygen solubility in surface waters leading to significant decrease of oxygen from future Ocean. Metabolism and diversity of microbes along with ocean biogeochemistry will be at great risk due to global warming and its related effects. As a response to the changes in temperature, alteration in the distribution of phytoplankta communities is observed all over the planet, creating changes in the primary production of the ocean causing massive impact on the biosphere. Marine microbial communities try to adapt to the changing ocean environmental conditions by responding with biogeographic range shifts, community structure modifications, and adaptive evolution. Persistence of this climate change on ocean ecosystems, in future, will pose serious threat to the metabolism and distribution of marine microbes leading to fluctuations in the biogeochemical cycles thereby affecting the overall ecosystem functioning. Genomics plays an important role in marine microbial research by providing tools to study the association between environment and organisms. The ecological and genomic perspectives of marine microbes are being investigated to design effective models to understand their physiology and evolution in a changing ocean.

The creation of reference chromosome-length genome assemblies allows for conservation genomics methods, such as population and ecological genomics, to be utilized. Despite being greatly threatened and of great importance in maintaining ecosystem function, chondrichthyan species have been repeatedly absent from conservation-based genome sequencing projects. Less than 1% of these species have a genome sequence, despite their almost 50% either threatened or Data Deficient conservation status. Most notably, there are seven orders within this class without any genome representation. In this review, we identify gaps in chondrichthyan genomic resources and demonstrate how the lack of genomic resources for this major taxonomic class is limiting the conservation of these already difficult to conserve species. We highlight other applications for chondrichthyans genomics, such as evolutionary and developmental biology. Likely, the mismatching sampling protocols and limited computational skills and communication between fields have been preventing the integration of marine and molecular sciences.

This marine teleost is a widely prized sportfish, but few resources have been devoted to the genomics and conservation of this species because it is not targeted by large-scale commercial fisheries. Population declines from recreational and artisanal overfishing have been observed in Hawai‘i, USA, resulting in both an interest in aquaculture and concerns about the long-term conservation of this species. Most research to-date has been performed in Hawai‘i, raising questions about the status of bluefin trevally populations across its Indo-Pacific range. Genomic resources allow for expanded research on stock status, genetic diversity, and population demography. We present a high quality, 711 Mb nuclear genome assembly of a Hawaiian bluefin trevally from noisy long-reads with a contig NG50 of 1.2 Mb and longest contig length of 8.9 Mb. As measured by single-copy orthologs, the assembly was 95% complete, and the genome is comprised of 16.9% repetitive elements. The assembly was annotated with 33.1 K protein-coding genes, 71.4% of which were assigned putative functions, using RNA-seq data from eight tissues from the same individual. This is the first whole-genome assembly published for the carangoid genus Caranx. Using this assembled genome, a multiple sequentially Markovian coalescent model was implemented to assess population demography. Estimates of effective population size suggest population expansion has occurred since the Late Pleistocene. This genome will be a valuable resource for comparative phylogenomic studies of carangoid fishes and will help elucidate demographic history and delineate stock structure for bluefin trevally populations throughout the Indo-Pacific. © The Author(s) 2021.

Vibrio campbellii DS40M4 is a wild-type isolate that has been recently established as a highly tractable model strain for bacterial genetics studies. We sought to exploit the tractability and relevance of this strain for characterization of flagellar gene regulation in V. campbellii. Using comparative genomics, we identified homologs of V. campbellii flagellar and chemotaxis genes conserved in other members of the Vibrionaceae and determined the transcriptional profile of these loci using differential RNA-seq. We systematically deleted all 63 predicted flagellar and chemotaxis genes in V. campbellii and examined their effects on motility and flagellum production. We specifically focused on the core regulators of the flagellar hierarchy established in other vibrios: RpoN (s54), FlrA, FlrC, and FliA. Our results show that V. campbellii transcription of flagellar and chemotaxis genes is governed by a multitiered regulatory hierarchy similar to other motile Vibrio species. However, there are several critical differences in V. campbellii: (i) the s54-dependent regulator FlrA is dispensable for motility; (ii) the flgA, fliEFGHIJ, flrA, and flrBC operons do not require s54 for expression; and (iii) FlrA and FlrC coregulate class II genes. Our model proposes that the V. campbellii flagellar transcriptional hierarchy has three classes of genes, in contrast to the four-class hierarchy in Vibrio cholerae. Our genetic and phenotypic dissection of the V. campbellii flagellar regulatory network highlights the differences that have evolved in flagellar regulation across the Vibrionaceae. IMPORTANCE Vibrio campbellii is a Gram-negative bacterium that is free-living and ubiquitous in marine environments and is an important global pathogen of fish and shellfish. Disruption of the flagellar motor significantly decreases host mortality of V. campbellii, suggesting that motility is a key factor in pathogenesis. Using this model organism, we identified .60 genes that encode proteins with predicted structural, mechanical, or regulatory roles in function of the single polar flagellum in V. campbellii. We systematically tested strains containing single deletions of each gene to determine the impact on motility and flagellum production. Our studies have uncovered differences in the regulatory network and function of several genes in V. campbellii compared to established systems in Vibrio cholerae and Vibrio parahaemolyticus.

As marine aquaculture of macroalgae expands globally, biologists are working to domesticate species of macroalgae by applying these techniques tested in agriculture to wild macroalgae species. Metabolomics has revealed metabolites and pathways that influence agriculturally relevant traits in crops, allowing for informed crop crossing schemes and genomic improvement strategies that would be pivotal to inform selection on macroalgae for domestication. Advances in metagenomics have improved understanding of host–symbiont interactions and the potential for microbial organisms to improve crop outcomes. There is much room in the field of macroalgal biology for further research toward improvement of macroalgae cultivars in aquaculture using metabolomic and metagenomic analyses.

We investigated the global population genomics of tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier), a circumglobally distributed, apex predator displaying remarkable behavioral versatility in its diet, habitat use (near coastal, coral reef, pelagic), and individual movement patterns (spatially resident to long-distance migrations). We genotyped 242 tiger sharks from 10 globally distributed locations at more than 2000 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Although this species often conducts massive distance migrations, the data show strong genetic differentiation at both neutral (FST = 0.125-0.144) and candidate outlier loci (FST = 0.570-0.761) between western Atlantic and Indo-Pacific sharks, suggesting the potential for adaptation to the environments specific to these oceanic regions. Within these regions, there was mixed support for population differentiation between northern and southern hemispheres in the western Atlantic, and none for structure within the Indian Ocean. Notably, the results demonstrate a low level of population differentiation of tiger sharks from the remote Hawaiian archipelago compared with sharks from the Indian Ocean (FST = 0.003-0.005, P < 0.01). Given concerns about biodiversity loss and marine ecosystem impacts caused by overfishing of oceanic sharks in the midst of rapid environmental change, our results suggest it imperative that international fishery management prioritize conservation of the evolutionary potential of the highly genetically differentiated Atlantic and Indo-Pacific populations of this unique apex predator. Furthermore, we suggest targeted management attention to tiger sharks in the Hawaiian archipelago based on a precautionary biodiversity conservation perspective. © 2021 The American Genetic Association. 2021.

The small number of cultured representatives of SAR116 (only two to date) is a major bottleneck that has prevented an in-depth study at the genomic level to understand the relationship between genome diversity and its role in the marine environment. In this study, we use all publicly available genomes to provide a genomic overview of the phylogeny, metabolism, and biogeography within the SAR116 clade. This increased genomic diversity has led to the discovery of two subclades that, despite coexisting in the same environment, display different properties in their genomic makeup. One represents a novel subclade for which no pure cultures have been isolated and is composed mainly of single-amplified genomes (SAGs). Genomes within this subclade showed convergent evolutionary trajectories with more streamlined features, such as low GC content (ca. 30%), short intergenic spacers (,22 bp), and strong purifying selection (low ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous polymorphisms [dN/dS]). Besides, they were more abundant in metagenomic databases recruiting at the deep chlorophyll maximum. Less abundant and restricted to the upper photic layers of the global ocean, the other subclade of SAR116, enriched in metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), included the only two pure cultures. Genomic analysis suggested that both clades have a significant role in the sulfur cycle with differences in the way both clades can metabolize dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP). IMPORTANCE The SAR116 clade of Alphaproteobacteria is a ubiquitous group of heterotrophic bacteria inhabiting the surface of the ocean, but the information about their ecology and population genomic diversity is scarce due to the difficulty of getting pure culture isolates. The combination of single-cell genomics and metagenomics has become an alternative approach to study these kinds of microbes. Our results expand the understanding of the genomic diversity, distribution, and lifestyles within this clade and provide evidence of different evolutionary trajectories in the genomic makeup of the two subclades that could serve to illustrate how evolutionary pressure can drive different adaptations to the same environment. Therefore, the SAR116 clade represents an ideal model organism for the study of the evolutionary streamlining of genomes in microbes that have relatively close relatedness to each other.

Ancestral genome size estimations were done across the nemertean phylogeny. The results increase the available genome size estimates for Nemertea three-fold. Our analyses show that Nemertea has a narrow genome size range (0.43–3.89 pg) compared to other phyla in Lophotrochozoa. A relationship between genome size and evolutionary rate, developmental modes, and habitat was found. Trait analyses show that the highest evolutionary rate of genome size is found in upper intertidal, viviparous species with direct development. Despite previous findings, body size in nemerteans was not correlated with genome size. A relatively small genome (1.18 pg) is assumed for the most recent common ancestor of all extant nemerteans.

Several mechanisms are hypothesized to explain CGP including natural selection, spatiotemporal fluctuations in larval source populations, self-recruitment, and sweepstake reproduction. Discriminating among them is extremely difficult but is fundamental to understanding how marine organisms reproduce and disperse. Here, we report a notable example of CGP in the Antarctic limpet, an unusually tractable system where multiple confounding explanations can be discounted. Using population genomics, temporally replicated sampling, surface drifters, and forward genetic simulations, we show that CGP likely arises from an extreme sweepstake event together with collective larval dispersal, while selection appears to be unimportant. Our results illustrate the importance of neutral demographic forces in natural populations and have important implications for understanding the recruitment dynamics, population connectivity, local adaptation, and resilience of marine populations.

We assembled the full double stranded, circular DNA genome sequences of these viruses (~113 and 132 kbp, respectively). Comparative genomics and phylogenetic analyses confirm that both belong within the family Nudiviridae but in separate clades representing nudiviruses found in freshwater and marine environments. We show that the three thymidine kinase (tk) genes present in all sequenced nudivirus genomes, thus far, were absent in the Crangon crangon nudivirus, suggesting there are twenty-eight core genes shared by all nudi-viruses. Furthermore, the phylogenetic data no longer support the subdivision of the family Nudi-viridae into four genera (Alphanudivirus to Deltanudivirus), as recently adopted by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), but rather shows two main branches of the family that are further subdivided.

A phylogenetic evaluation of sequenced Vibrio strains in Genbank revealed that BB120 is closely related to the environmental isolate V. campbellii DS40M4. We exploited DS40M4's competence for exogenous DNA uptake to rapidly generate greater than 30 isogenic strains with deletions of genes encoding BB120 quorum-sensing system homologues. Our results show that the quorum-sensing circuit of DS40M4 is distinct from BB120 in three ways: (i) DS40M4 does not produce an acyl homoserine lactone autoinducer but encodes an active orphan LuxN receptor, (ii) the quorum regulatory small RNAs (Qrrs) are not solely regulated by autoinducer signalling through the response regulator LuxO and (iii) the DS40M4 quorum-sensing regulon is much smaller than BB120 (~100 genes vs. ~400 genes, respectively). Using comparative genomics to expand our understanding of quorum-sensing circuit diversity, we observe that conservation of LuxM/LuxN proteins differs widely both between and within Vibrio species. These strains are also phenotypically distinct: DS40M4 exhibits stronger interbacterial cell killing, whereas BB120 forms more robust biofilms and is bioluminescent.

However, second-generation sequencing metagenomics (mostly Illumina) suffers from limitations, particularly in the assembly of microbes with high microdiversity and retrieval of the flexible (adaptive) fraction of prokaryotic genomes. Here, we have used a third-generation technique to study the metagenome of a well-known marine sample from the mixed epipelagic water column of the winter Mediterranean. We have compared PacBio Sequel II with the classical approach using Illumina Nextseq short reads followed by assembly to study the metagenome. Long reads allow for efficient direct retrieval of complete genes avoiding the bias of the assembly step. Besides, the application of long reads on metagenomic assembly allows for the reconstruction of much more complete metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), particularly from microbes with high microdiversity such as Pelagibacterales. The flexible genome of reconstructed MAGs was much more complete containing many adaptive genes (some with biotechnological potential). PacBio Sequel II CCS appears particularly suitable for cellular metagenomics due to its low error rate. For most applications of metagenomics, from community structure analysis to ecosystem functioning, long reads should be applied whenever possible. Specifically, for in silico screening of biotechnologically useful genes, or population genomics, long-read metagenomics appears presently as a very fruitful approach and can be analyzed from raw reads before a computationally demanding (and potentially artifactual) assembly step. © Copyright © 2021 Haro-Moreno, López-Pérez and Rodriguez-Valera.","CRISPR; long-read sequencing; metagenome; metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs); PacBio CCS long-reads; polyketide synthase (PKS)","contig; glycosyltransferase; internal transcribed spacer; polyketide synthase; rhodopsin; RNA 16S; sea water; Alphaproteobacteria; Article; clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat; computer model; Cyanothece; DNA extraction; genome; glycosylation; high throughput sequencing; long read sequencing; metagenome assembled genome; metagenomics; microbial gene; microbial genome; molecular genetics; nonhuman; optogenetics; phylogenetic tree; Planctomycetes; principal component analysis; Prochlorococcus; RNA sequence; Sanger sequencing; sequence alignment; Synechococcus; Thaumarchaeota; Verrucomicrobia",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Efforts have increasingly been dedicated to the use of bacteria DNA derived data to develop biotic indices for benthic monitoring. However, a substantial debate exists about whether bacteria-derived data using DNA metabarcoding should follow, for example, a taxonomy-based or a taxonomy-free approach to marine bioassessments. Here, we showcase the value of DNA-based monitoring using the impact of fish farming as an example of anthropogenic disturbances in coastal areas and compare the performance of taxonomy-based and taxonomy-free approaches in detecting environmental alterations. We analysed samples collected near to the farm cages and along distance gradients from two aquaculture installations, and at control sites, to evaluate the effect of this activity on bacterial assemblages. Using the putative response of bacterial taxa to stress we calculated the taxonomy-based biotic index microgAMBI. The distribution of individual amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), as a function of a gradient in sediment acid volatile sulphides, was then used to derive a taxonomy-free bacterial biotic index specific for this data set using a de novo approach based on quantile regression splines. Our results show that microgAMBI revealed a organically enriched environment along the gradient. However, the de novo biotic index outperformed microgAMBI by providing a higher discriminatory power in detecting changes in abiotic factors directly related to fish production, whilst allowing the identification of new ASVs bioindicators. The de novo strategy applied here represents a robust method to define new bioindicators in regions or habitats where no previous information about the response of bacteria to environmental stressors exists. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","anthropogenic impacts; biomonitoring; genomic approaches; metabarcoding; molecular methods","bacterial DNA; animal; bacterium; biodiversity; classification; DNA barcoding; environmental monitoring; genetics; Animals; Bacteria; Biodiversity; DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic; DNA, Bacterial; Environmental Monitoring",Article,"",Scopus

Classical microbiological techniques have been able to help us classify many of these new strains but at times have limited our ability to see the true relationships among or within species. The closest relatives of Brucella are soil bacteria and the adaptations of Brucella spp. to live intracellularly suggest that the genus has evolved to live in vertebrate hosts. Several recently discovered species appear to have phenotypes that are intermediate between soil bacteria and core Brucella, suggesting that they may represent ancestral traits that were subsequently lost in the traditional species. Remarkably, the broad relationships among Brucella species using a variety of sequence and fragment-based approaches have been upheld when using comparative genomics with whole genomes. Nonetheless, genomes are required for fine-scale resolution of many of the relationships and for understanding the evolutionary history of the genus.

These bacteria are capable of modifying their membrane lipid composition in response to environmental change. Remarkably, a variety of lipids are produced in these bacteria, including phosphorus-containing glycerophospholipids and several amino acid-containing aminolipids such as ornithine lipids and glutamine lipids. Here, we present the identification and characterization of a novel sulfur-containing aminolipid (SAL) in roseobacters. Using high resolution accurate mass spectrometry, a SAL was found in the lipid extract of Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS-3 and Phaeobacter inhibens DSM 17395. Using comparative genomics, transposon mutagenesis and targeted gene knockout, we identified a gene encoding a putative lyso-lipid acyltransferase, designated salA, which is essential for the biosynthesis of this SAL. Multiple sequence analysis and structural modeling suggest that SalA is a novel member of the lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (LPAAT) family, the prototype of which is the PlsC acyltransferase responsible for the biosynthesis of the phospholipid phosphatidic acid. SAL appears to play a key role in biofilm formation in roseobacters. salA is widely distributed in Tara Oceans metagenomes and actively expressed in Tara Oceans metatranscriptomes.

Large expansions of the IL-17 repertoire were observed in marine molluscs and echinoderm species.

Molecular ecological studies have been instrumental in advancing such understanding, and while initially focused primarily on broad-scale patterns, they have gradually uncovered the prevalence of local genetic structuring. Genome-wide sequencing approaches have provided new opportunities to understand both neutral and adaptive contributions to this largely unexplained diversity, but fine-scale assessments have been hampered by challenges associated with aquatic environments, in terms of (geo)referencing, seafloor characterization, and in situ phenotyping. Here, we discuss the potential of “reefscape genomics,” leveraging recent advances in underwater imaging to enable spatially explicit genomic studies on coral reefs. More specifically, we consider how (close-range) photogrammetry approaches enable (1) fine-scale spatial mapping of benthic target organisms, (2) repeatable characterization of the abiotic and biotic reefscape, and (3) simultaneous in situ mass-phenotyping. The spatially explicit consideration of genomic data –combined with detailed environmental and phenotypic characterization– opens up the opportunity for fine-scale landscape genomic approaches on coral reefs (and other marine ecosystems). Such approaches enable assessment of the spatio-temporal drivers and adaptive potential of the extensive genetic structuring and cryptic diversity encountered in benthic invertebrates, such as reef-building corals. Considering the threats that coral reefs are facing worldwide, we believe that reefscape genomics represents a promising advancement of our molecular ecological toolkit to help inform how we can most effectively conserve and restore coral reef ecosystems into the future. © Copyright © 2021 Bongaerts, Dubé, Prata, Gijsbers, Achlatis and Hernandez-Agreda.","coral reefs; landscape genomics; photogrammetry; reefscape genomics; seascape genomics; structure from motion",,Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Two shape-based morphotypes have been identified for the green turtle (Chelonia mydas) in the Pacific Ocean: the south-central/western or yellow turtle and north-central/eastern or black turtle. The genetic differentiation between these morphotypes and the adaptation of the black turtle to environmentally contrasting conditions of the eastern Pacific region has remained a mystery for decades. Here we addressed both questions using a reduced-representation genome approach (Dartseq; 9473 neutral SNPs) and identifying candidate outlier loci (67 outlier SNPs) of biological relevance between shape-based morphotypes from eight Pacific foraging grounds (n = 158). Our results support genetic divergence between morphotypes, probably arising from strong natal homing behaviour. Genes and enriched biological functions linked to thermoregulation, hypoxia, melanism, morphogenesis, osmoregulation, diet and reproduction were found to be outliers for differentiation, providing evidence for adaptation of C. mydas to the eastern Pacific region and suggesting independent evolutionary trajectories of the shape-based morphotypes.

The genus Oithona is described as having the highest density of copepods. The Oithona male paradox describes the activity states of males, which are obliged to alternate between immobile and mobile phases for ambush feeding and mate searching, respectively, while the female is less mobile and feeds less. To characterize the molecular basis of this sexual dimorphism, we combined immunofluorescence, genomics, transcriptomics, and protein–protein interaction approaches and revealed the presence of a male-specific nervous ganglion. Transcriptomic analysis showed male-specific enrichment for nervous system development-related transcripts. Twenty-seven Lin12-Notch Repeat domain-containing protein coding genes (LDPGs) of the 75 LDPGs identified in the genome were specifically expressed in males. Furthermore, some LDPGs coded for proteins with predicted proteolytic activity, and proteases-associated transcripts showed a male-specific enrichment. Using yeast double–hybrid assays, we constructed a protein– protein interaction network involving two LDPs with proteases, extracellular matrix proteins, and neurogenesis-related proteins.

Comparative genomics methods aimed at this goal measure the association between evolutionary changes at the genetic level with traits evolving convergently across phylogenetic lineages. However, these methods have complex statistical behaviors that are influenced by nontrivial and oftentimes unknown confounding factors. Consequently, using standard statistical analyses in interpreting the outputs of these methods leads to potentially inaccurate conclusions. Here, we introduce phylogenetic permulations, a novel statistical strategy that combines phylogenetic simulations and permutations to calculate accurate, unbiased P values from phylogenetic methods. Permulations construct the null expectation for P values from a given phylogenetic method by empirically generating null phenotypes. Subsequently, empirical P values that capture the true statistical confidence given the correlation structure in the data are directly calculated based on the empirical null expectation. We examine the performance of permulation methods by analyzing both binary and continuous phenotypes, including marine, subterranean, and long-lived large-bodied mammal phenotypes. Our results reveal that permulations improve the statistical power of phylogenetic analyses and correctly calibrate statements of confidence in rejecting complex null distributions while maintaining or improving the enrichment of known functions related to the phenotype. We also find that permulations refine pathway enrichment analyses by correcting for nonindependence in gene ranks. Our results demonstrate that permulations are a powerful tool for improving statistical confidence in the conclusions of phylogenetic analysis when the parametric null is unknown. © 2021 The Author(s).

NanoSIMS confirmed incorporation of 13C into individual bacterial cells of Fusibacteraceae sorted from microcosms. Genomes of the 13C-labelled taxa all encoded enzymatic repertoires for catabolism of DNA or subcomponents of DNA.

Arctic Char (Salvelinus alpinus) is an anadromous salmonid and the most harvested fish species by Inuit people, including in Nunavik (Québec, Canada), one of the most recently deglaciated regions in the world. Unlike many other anadromous salmonids, Arctic Char occupy coastal habitats near their natal rivers during their short marine phase restricted to the summer ice-free period. Our main objective was to document putatively neutral and adaptive genomic variation in anadromous Arctic Char populations from Nunavik and bordering regions to inform local fisheries management. We used genotyping by sequencing (GBS) to genotype 18,112 filtered single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in 650 individuals from 23 sampling locations along >2000 km of coastline. Our results reveal a hierarchical genetic structure, whereby neighboring hydrographic systems harbor distinct populations grouped by major oceanographic basins: Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Ungava Bay, and Labrador Sea. We found genetic diversity and differentiation to be consistent both with the expected postglacial recolonization history and with patterns of isolation-by-distance reflecting contemporary gene flow. Results from three gene–environment association methods supported the hypothesis of local adaptation to both freshwater and marine environments (strongest associations with sea surface and air temperatures during summer and salinity). Our results support a fisheries management strategy at a regional scale, and other implications for hatchery projects and adaptation to climate change are discussed. © 2021 The Authors.

While many species are challenged by reduced-pH levels, some species benefit from the altered environment and thrive. Here, we explore the molecular mechanisms of adaptation to ocean acidification in a population of a temperate fish species that experiences increased population sizes under elevated CO2. Fish from CO2 seeps exhibited an overall increased gene expression in gonad tissue compared with those from ambient CO2 sites. Up-regulated genes at CO2 seeps are possible targets of adaptive selection as they can directly influence the physiological performance of fishes exposed to ocean acidification. Most of the up-regulated genes at seeps were functionally involved in the maintenance of pH homeostasis and increased metabolism, and presented a deviation from neutral evolution expectations in their patterns of DNA polymorphisms, providing evidence for adaptive selection to ocean acidification. The targets of this adaptive selection are likely regulatory sequences responsible for the increased expression of these genes, which would allow a fine-tuned physiological regulation to maintain homeostasis and thrive at CO2 seeps. Our findings reveal that standing genetic variation in DNA sequences regulating the expression of genes in response to a reduced-pH environment could provide for adaptive potential to near-future ocean acidification in fishes. Moreover, with this study we provide a forthright methodology combining transcriptomics and genomics, which can be applied to infer the adaptive potential to different environmental conditions in wild marine populations. © 2021 The Authors.

In this study, we provide a high-quality chromosome-level genome assembled using Pacific Bioscience long reads and Hi-C-based and linkage-map-based scaffolding technologies and a high-resolution variation map constructed using large-scale resequencing analysis. The 586.8 Mb genome consists of 10 pseudochromosome sequences ranging from 38.6 to 78.9 Mb, containing 301 contigs with an N50 size of 3.1 Mb. A total of 30,078 protein-coding genes were predicted, of which 22,757 (75.7%) were high-reliability annotations supported by a homologous match to a curated protein in the SWISS-PROT database or transcript expression. Although a medium level of repeat components (57.2%) was detected, the genomic content of the segmental duplications reached 26.2%, which is the highest among the reported genomes. By whole genome resequencing analysis of 495 Pacific oysters, a comprehensive variation map was built, comprised of 4.78 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 0.60 million short insertions and deletions, and 49,333 copy number variation regions. The structural variations can lead to an average interindividual genomic divergence of 0.21, indicating their crucial role in shaping the Pacific oyster genome diversity. The large amount of mosaic distributed repeat elements, small variations, and copy number variations indicate that the Pacific oyster is a diploid organism with an extremely high genomic complexity at the intra- and interindividual level.

Polar cod Boreogadus saida (Lepechin, 1774) is an abundant circumpolar marine fish and ecological key species. The central role of polar cod in the Arctic marine food web warrants a better understanding of its population structure and connectivity. In this study, the genetic population structure of 171 juveniles, collected from several fjords off West-Svalbard (Billefjorden, Hornsund and Kongsfjorden), the northern Sophia Basin and the Eurasian Basin of the Arctic Ocean, was analysed using nine DNA microsatellite loci. Genetic analyses indicated moderate to high genetic diversity, but absence of spatial population structure and isolation-by-distance, suggesting ongoing gene flow between the studied sampling regions. High levels of connectivity may be key for polar cod to maintain populations across wide spatial scales. The adaptive capacity of the species will be increasingly important to face challenges such as habitat fragmentation, ocean warming and changes in prey composition. In view of a limited understanding of the population dynamics and evolution of polar cod, a valuable next step to predict future developments should be an integrated biological evaluation, including population genomics, a life-history approach, and habitat and biophysical dispersal modelling. © 2021 Fisheries Society of the British Isles","central Arctic Ocean; connectivity; DNA microsatellites; population differentiation; population structure","animal; Arctic; ecosystem; Gadiformes; gene flow; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; Animals; Arctic Regions; Ecosystem; Gadiformes; Gene Flow; Svalbard",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

Traditionally, these evolutionarily diverse organisms have been combined into a single functional group (heterotrophic flagellates), overlooking their organismal differences. Here, we investigated four evolutionarily related species belonging to one cosmopolitan group of uncultured marine picoeukaryotic predators: Marine stramenopiles (MAST)-4 (species A, B, C, and E). Co-occurrence and distribution analyses in the global surface ocean indicated contrasting patterns in MAST-4A and C, suggesting adaptation to different temperatures. We then investigated whether these spatial distribution patterns were mirrored by MAST-4 genomic content using single-cell genomics. Analyses of 69 single cells recovered 66 to 83% of the MAST-4A/B/C/E genomes, which displayed substantial interspecies divergence. MAST-4 genomes were similar in terms of broad gene functional categories, but they differed in enzymes of ecological relevance, such as glycoside hydrolases (GHs), which are part of the food degradation machinery in MAST-4. Interestingly, MAST-4 species featuring a similar GH composition (A and C) coexcluded each other in the surface global ocean, while species with a different set of GHs (B and C) appeared to be able to coexist, suggesting further niche diversification associated with prey digestion. We propose that differential niche adaptation to temperature and prey type has promoted adaptive evolutionary diversification in MAST-4. We show that minute ocean predators from the same phylogenetic group may have different biogeography and genomic content, which needs to be accounted for to better comprehend marine food webs. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

It provokes Piscirickettsiosis outbreaks in the marine phase of salmonid farming, resulting in economic losses. The monophyletic genogroup LF-89 and a divergent genogroup EM-90 are responsible for the most severe Piscirickettsiosis outbreaks in Chile. Therefore, the development of methods for quick genotyping of P. salmonis genogroups in field samples is vital for veterinary diagnoses and understanding the population structure of this pathogen. The present study reports the development of a multiplex PCR for genotyping LF-89 and EM-90 genogroups based on comparative genomics of 73 fully sequenced P. salmonis genomes. The results revealed 2,322 sequences shared between 35 LF-89 genomes, 2,280 sequences in the core-genome of 38 EM-90 genomes, and 331 and 534 accessory coding sequences each genogroup, respectively. A total of 1,801 clusters of coding sequences were shared among all tested genomes of P. salmonis (LF-89 and EM-90), with 253 and 291 unique sequences for LF-89 and EM-90 genogroups, respectively. The Multiplex-1 prototype was chosen for reliable genotyping because of differences in annealing temperatures and respective reaction efficiencies. This method also identified the pathogen in field samples infected with LF-89 or EM-90 strains, which is not possible with other methods currently available.

Understanding how microorganisms establish functional sponge–microbe interactions in the Antarctic marine ecosystem provides clues about the success of these ancient animals in this realm. Here, we use a culture-dependent approach and genome sequencing to investigate the molecular determinants that promote a dual lifestyle in three bacterial genera Sporosarcina, Cellulophaga, and Nesterenkonia. Phylogenomic analyses showed that four sponge-associated isolates represent putative novel bacterial species within the Sporosarcina and Nesterenkonia genera and that the fifth bacterial isolate corresponds to Cellulophaga algicola. We inferred that isolated sponge-associated bacteria inhabit similarly marine sponges and also seawater. Comparative genomics revealed that these sponge-associated bacteria are enriched in symbiotic lifestyle-related genes. Specific adaptations related to the cold Antarctic environment are features of the bacterial strains isolated here. Furthermore, we showed evidence that the vitamin B5 synthesis-related gene, panE from Nesterenkonia E16_7 and E16_10, was laterally transferred within Actinobacteria members.

A unique way to study evolutionary and ecological mechanisms that either limit species' spread or facilitate range expansions is to conduct research on species that have restricted distributions. Nonindigenous species, particularly those that are highly invasive but have not yet spread beyond the introduced site, represent ideal systems to study range size changes. Here, we used species distribution modeling and genomic data to study the restricted range of a highly invasive Australian marine species, the ascidian Pyura praeputialis. This species is an aggressive space occupier in its introduced range (Chile), where it has fundamentally altered the coastal community. We found high genomic diversity in Chile, indicating high adaptive potential. In addition, genomic data clearly showed that a single region from Australia was the only donor of genotypes to the introduced range. We identified over 3,500 km of suitable habitat adjacent to its current introduced range that has so far not been occupied, and importantly species distribution models were only accurate when genomic data were considered. Our results suggest that a slight change in currents, or a change in shipping routes, may lead to an expansion of the species' introduced range that will encompass a vast portion of the South American coast.

Here we investigate the extent to which gene flow occurs between fragmented populations of the deep-water brown algae Ericaria zosteroides (Turner) Greville (Sargassaceae, Fucales). These investigations were performed at different spatial scales from the bay of Marseille (western Provence) to Corsica. As dispersal of zygotes is shown to be limited over distances beyond a few meters, we used a multidisciplinary approach, based on Lagrangian modeling and population genomics to test the hypothesis that drifting of fertile parts of thallus (eggs on fertile branches), mediated by ocean currents, enable occasional gene flow between populations. Therefore we assessed the respective contribution of oceanographic connectivity, geographical isolation, and seawater temperatures to the genetic structure of this species. The genetic structure was assessed using 10,755 neutral SNPs and 12 outlier SNPs genotyped by dd-RAD sequencing in 261 individuals of E. zosteroides. We find that oceanographic connectivity is the best predictor of genetic structure, while differentiation in outlier SNPs can be explained by the depth of populations, as emphasized by the minimum seawater temperature predictor. However, further investigations will be necessary for clarifying how depth drives adaptive genetic differentiation in E. zosteroides. Our analyses revealed that local hydrodynamic conditions are correlated with the very high divergence of one population in the Bay of Marseille. Overall, the levels of gene flow mediated by drifting were certainly not sufficient to counteract differentiation by local genetic drift, but enough to allow colonization several kilometers away.

Recent studies show these to be components of a network of highly regulated systems connecting apoptotic processes to counter-invader immunity, in prokaryotes with a multicellular habit. However, the provenance of key adaptor domains, namely those of the Death-like and TRADD-N superfamilies, a quintessential feature of metazoan apoptotic systems, remained murky. Here, we use sensitive sequence analysis and comparative genomics methods to identify unambiguous bacterial homologs of the Death-like and TRADD-N superfamilies. We show the former to have arisen as part of a radiation of effector-associated α-helical adaptor domains that likely mediate homotypic interactions bringing together diverse effector and signaling domains in predicted bacterial apoptosis-and counter-invader systems. Similarly, we show that the TRADD-N domain defines a key, widespread signaling bridge that links effector deployment to invader-sensing in multicellular bacterial and metazoan counter-invader systems. TRADD-N domains are expanded in aggregating marine invertebrates and point to distinctive diversifying immune strategies probably directed both at RNA and retroviruses and cellular pathogens that might infect such communities. These TRADD-N and Death-like domains helped identify several new bacterial and metazoan counter-invader systems featuring underappreciated, common functional principles: the use of intracellular invader-sensing lectin-like (NPCBM and FGS), transcription elongation GreA/B-C, glycosyltransferase-4 family, inactive NTPase (serving as nucleic acid receptors), and invader-sensing GTPase switch domains. Finally, these findings point to the possibility of multicellular bacteria-stem metazoan symbiosis in the emergence of the immune/ apoptotic systems of the latter. ‍ ‍Copyright Kaur et al.",,"bacterial protein; glycosyltransferase; glyoxalase; guanosine triphosphatase; nucleoside triphosphatase; polyubiquitin; tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 2; von Willebrand factor; bacterial protein; tumor necrosis factor receptor associated death domain protein; Achromobacter; Acropora; Aeromonas caviae; apoptosis; Article; bacterial infection; Bacteroidetes; bioinformatics; Cnidaria; controlled study; Crassostrea gigas; cyanobacterium; death domain superfamily; echinoderm; endosymbiont; enzyme activity; Gammaproteobacteria; genomics; glycosylation; immune response; marine invertebrate; Mesorhizobium; Microcystis; Micromonospora; Nitrosomonas; phylogeny; prevalence; prokaryote; protein phosphorylation; protein protein interaction; protein secondary structure; Proteobacteria; retroposon; Retroviridae; Rhizobium rhizogenes; Salmo salar; sequence alignment; sequence analysis; Strongylocentrotus purpuratus; symbiosis; transcription elongation; ubiquitination; virus inhibition; bacterium; death domain superfamily; genetics; host pathogen interaction; immunology; metabolism; microbial viability; molecular evolution; prokaryotic cell; signal transduction; Apoptosis; Bacteria; Bacterial Proteins; Death Domain Superfamily; Evolution, Molecular; Genomics; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Microbial Viability; Phylogeny; Prokaryotic Cells; Signal Transduction; Symbiosis; TNF Receptor-Associated Death Domain Protein",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

The Pacbio platform was employed to sequence the MH196537 strain, and genomic information from the other 16 strains was used for comparative analyses. All coding sequences of the 17 strains were categorized in RASTtk Sub-systems. The MH196537 strain had one contig, and it shared a high average nucleotide identity (ANI) with the freshwater strains (0.9994 – 0.9999) rather than the seawater strains (0.9985 – 0.9994). Moreover, 22 RASTtk subsystems carried a different number of genes from each N. seriolae. The fatty acids, lipids, and isoprenoids subsystem showed the highest mean decrease in the Gini index of over 1.5. Interestingly, freshwater strains were found to harbor all of the genes for both the mevalonate (MVA) and non-mevalonate pathways (MEP), whereas only the MEP existed in strains from diseased marine fish. Considering the differences in the byproducts of isoprenoids from the different pathways, it is likely that this will affect host–pathogen interactions; therefore, harboring the different pathways for the synthesis of isoprenoids could be an important pathogenic factor of N. seriolae. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,"algorithm; animal; fish disease; genomics; Nocardia; phylogeny; Algorithms; Animals; Fish Diseases; Genomics; Nocardia; Phylogeny",Article,"",Scopus

The influence of environmental features on the genetic structure of populations has key implications for the dynamics and persistence of populations, and an understanding of spatial scales and patterns of connectivity is crucial for management and conservation. This study employed a seascape genomics approach combining larval dispersal modeling and population genomic analysis using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) obtained from RADseq to examine environmental factors influencing patterns of genetic structure and connectivity for a highly dispersive mud crab Scylla olivacea (Herbst, 1796) in the Sulu Sea. Dispersal simulations reveal widespread but asymmetric larval dispersal influenced by persistent southward and westward surface circulation features in the Sulu Sea. Despite potential for widespread dispersal across the Sulu Sea, significant genetic differentiation was detected among eight populations based on 1,655 SNPs (FST = 0.0057, p &lt;.001) and a subset of 1,643 putatively neutral SNP markers (FST = 0.0042, p &lt;.001). Oceanography influences genetic structure, with redundancy analysis (RDA) indicating significant contribution of asymmetric ocean currents to neutral genetic variation ((Formula presented.) = 0.133, p =.035). Genetic structure may also reflect demographic factors, with divergent populations characterized by low effective population sizes (Ne &lt; 50). Pronounced latitudinal genetic structure was recovered for loci putatively under selection (FST = 0.2390, p &lt;.001), significantly correlated with sea surface temperature variabilities during peak spawning months for S. olivacea ((Formula presented.) = 0.692–0.763; p &lt;.050), suggesting putative signatures of selection and local adaptation to thermal clines. While oceanography and dispersal ability likely shape patterns of gene flow and genetic structure of S. olivacea across the Sulu Sea, the impacts of genetic drift and natural selection influenced by sea surface temperature also appear as likely drivers of population genetic structure. This study contributes to the growing body of literature documenting population genetic structure and local adaptation for highly dispersive marine species, and provides information useful for spatial management of the fishery resource. © 2021 The Authors.

Furthermore, little is known about the genetic diversity of maerl-forming species and the population structure of maerl beds, both of which are important for understanding the ability of these species to adapt to changing environments and for informing marine reserve planning. In this study, we used a whole genome genotyping approach to explore the population genomics of Phymatolithon calcareum, a maerl-forming red algal species, whose geographical distribution spans the north-east Atlantic, from Norway to Portugal. Our results, using 14,150 genome-wide SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms), showed that P. calcareum maerl beds across the north-east Atlantic are generally structured geographically, a pattern likely explained by low dispersal potential and limited connectivity between regions. Additionally, we found that P. calcareum from the Fal Estuary, south-west England, is genetically distinct from all other P. calcareum sampled, even from The Manacles, a site located only 13 km away. Further analysis revealed that this finding is not the result of introgression from two closely related species, Phymatolithon purpureum or Lithothamnion corallioides. Instead, this unique diversity may have been shaped over time by geographical isolation of the Fal Estuary maerl bed and a lack of gene flow with other P. calcareum populations. The genomic data presented in this study suggest that P. calcareum genetic diversity has accumulated over large temporal and spatial scales, the preservation of which will be important for maximizing the resilience of this species to changes in climate and the environment. Moreover, our findings underline the importance of managing the conservation of maerl beds across western Europe as distinct units, at a site-by-site level. © 2021 The Authors.

Edwardsiella piscicida is one of the fish pathogens that seriously infect cultured and wild fish species. To understand the molecular immune mechanisms underlying the response to E. piscicida, a comparative gene transcription analysis was performed through RNA-Seq technology. The low-quality sequences were excluded, and the high-quality sequences were assembled into a total of 60,759 contigs with an average length of 988.95 bp. A gene ontology (GO) analysis was employed to classify 5744 genes according to three major functional categories: molecular function, cellular component and biological process. A total of 19,918 genes were successfully annotated into 26 functional categories according to the clusters of orthologous groups (COG) classification. Furthermore, 15,006 genes were classified into 332 KEGG pathways. The q-value was introduced to estimate 5109 genes significantly differentially expressed which includes 1781 up-regulated genes and 3328 down-regulated genes. The differentially expressed genes were involved in the major immune-related pathways which refer to the pathogen recognition, inflammation, Toll-like receptor and chemokine signalling pathways.

Among them, the marine stramenopiles (MASTs) represent numerous independent lineages that are only known from environmental sequences retrieved from marine samples. The core energy metabolism characterizing these unicellular eukaryotes is poorly understood. Here, we used single-cell genomics to retrieve, annotate, and compare the genomes of 15 MAST species, obtained by coassembling sequences from 140 individual cells sampled from the marine surface plankton. Functional annotations from their gene repertoires are compatible with all of them being phagocytotic. The unique presence of rhodopsin genes in MAST species, together with their widespread expression in oceanic waters, supports the idea that MASTs may be capable of using sunlight to thrive in the photic ocean. Additional subsets of genes used in phagocytosis, such as proton pumps for vacuole acidification and peptidases for prey digestion, did not reveal particular trends in MAST genomes as compared with nonphagocytotic stramenopiles, except a larger presence and diversity of V-PPase genes. Our analysis reflects the complexity of phagocytosis machinery in microbial eukaryotes, which contrasts with the well-defined set of genes for photosynthesis.

Byssal threads composed of many proteins extend like tendons from muscle cells, ending in adhesive pads that attach underwater. Crucial to settlement and metamorphosis, larvae of virtually all species are byssate. By contrast, in adults, the byssus is scattered throughout bivalves, where it has had profound effects on morphological evolution and been key to adaptive radiations of epifaunal species. I compare byssus structure and proteins in blue mussels (Mytilus), by far the best characterized, to zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha), in which several byssal proteins have been isolated and sequenced. By mapping the adult byssus onto a recent phylogenomic tree, I confirm its independent evolution in these and other lineages, likely parallelisms with common origins in development. While the byssus is superficially similar in Dreissena and Mytilus, in finer detail it is not, and byssal proteins are dramatically different. I used the chromosome-scale D. polymorpha genome we recently assembled to search for byssal genes and found 37 byssal loci on 10 of the 16 chromosomes. Most byssal genes are in small families, with several amino acid substitutions between paralogs. Byssal proteins of zebra mussels and related quagga mussels (D. rostriformis) are divergent, suggesting rapid evolution typical of proteins with repetitive low complexity domains. Opportunities abound for proteomic and genomic work to further our understanding of this textbook example of a marine natural material. A priority should be invasive bivalves, given the role of byssal attachment in the spread of, and ecological and economic damage caused by zebra mussels, quagga mussels and others.

Significant recent progress in long-read sequencing technologies such as PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) has also brought about a large variety of assemblers. Although these have been extensively tested on model species such as Homo sapiens and Drosophila melanogaster, such benchmarking has not been done in Mollusca, which lacks widely adopted model species. Molluscan genomes are notoriously rich in repeats and are often highly heterozygous, making their assembly challenging. Here, we benchmarked 10 assemblers based on ONT raw reads from two published molluscan genomes of differing properties, the gastropod Chrysomallon squamiferum (356.6 Mb, 1.59% heterozygosity) and the bivalve Mytilus coruscus (1593 Mb, 1.94% heterozygosity). By optimizing the assembly pipeline, we greatly improved both genomes from previously published versions. Our results suggested that 40-50X of ONT reads are sufficient for high-quality genomes, with Flye being the recommended assembler for compact and less heterozygous genomes exemplified by C. squamiferum, while NextDenovo excelled for more repetitive and heterozygous molluscan genomes exemplified by M. coruscus. A phylogenomic analysis using the two updated genomes with 32 other published high-quality lophotrochozoan genomes resulted in maximum support across all nodes, and we show that improved genome quality also leads to more complete matrices for phylogenomic inferences. Our benchmarking will ensure efficiency in future assemblies for molluscs and perhaps also for other marine phyla with few genomes available.

We then unveiled the empedopeptin biosynthetic gene cluster. The core nonribosomal peptide gene null-mutant strains (ΔempC, ΔempD, and ΔempE) could not produce empedopeptin, while dioxygenase gene null-mutant strains (ΔempA and ΔempB) produced several unique empedopeptin analogs. However, the antibiotic activity of ΔempA and ΔempB was significantly reduced compared with the wild-type, demonstrating that the hydroxylated amino acid residues of empedopeptin and its analogs are important to their antibiotic activity. Furthermore, we found seven bacterial strains that could produce empedopeptin-like cyclic lipopeptides using a genome mining approach.

In this review, we focused on different omics approaches and techniques to investigate lipid metabolism and radiation impacts on lipids in toothed whales. The selected literature was screened, and capacities, possibilities, and future approaches for identifying unusual lipid synthesis pathways by omics were evaluated. Omics approaches were categorized into the four major disciplines: lipidomics, transcriptomics, genomics, and proteomics. Genomics and transcriptomics can together identify genes related to unique lipid synthesis. As lipids interact with proteins in the animal body, lipidomics, and proteomics can correlate by creating lipid-binding proteome maps to elucidate metabolism pathways. In lipidomics studies, recent mass spectroscopic methods can address lipid profiles; however, the determination of structures of lipids are challeng-ing. As an environmental stress, the acoustic radiation has a significant effect on the alteration of lipid profiles. Radiation studies in different omics approaches revealed the necessity of multi-omics applications. This review concluded that a combination of many of the omics areas may elucidate the metabolism of lipids and possible hazards on lipids in toothed whales by radiation. © 2021 by the authors.

However, whether genomic traits influence their distribution and marine adaptation remains to be answered. In this study, we per-formed phylogenomics and comparative genomics studies using 132 Bdellovibrionota genomes along with five metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from deep sea zones. Four phylogenetic groups, Oligoflexia, Bdello-group1, Bdello-group2 and Bacteriovoracia, were revealed by con-structing a phylogenetic tree, of which 53.84% of Bdello-group2 and 48.94% of Bacteriovoracia were derived from the ocean. Bacteriovoracia was more prevalent in deep sea zones, whereas Bdel-lo-group2 was largely distributed in the epipelagic zone. Metabolic reconstruction indicated that genes involved in chemotaxis, flagellar (mobility), type II secretion system, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and penicillin-binding protein were necessary for the predatory lifestyle of Bdellovibrionota. Genes involved in glycerol metabolism, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) degradation, cell wall recycling and peptide utilization were ubiquitously present in Bdellovibrionota genomes. Comparative genomics between marine and non-marine Bdellovibrionota demonstrated that be-taine as an osmoprotectant is probably widely used by marine Bdellovibrionota, and all the marine genomes have a number of genes for adaptation to marine environments. The genes encoding chitinase and chitin-binding protein were identified for the first time in Oligoflexia, which implied that Oligoflexia may prey on a wider spectrum of microbes. This study expands our knowledge on adaption strategies of Bdellovibrionota inhabiting deep seas and the potential usage of Oligoflexia for biological control. © 2021 by the authors.

There are, however, reefs that have been exposed to recurrent thermal stress over the years and whose corals appear to have been tolerant against heat. One of the mechanisms that could explain this phenomenon is local adaptation, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly known. In this work, we applied a seascape genomics approach to study heat stress adaptation in three coral species of New Caledonia (southwestern Pacific) and to uncover the molecular actors potentially involved. We used remote sensing data to characterize the environmental trends across the reef system, and sampled corals living at the most contrasted sites. These samples underwent next generation sequencing to reveal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), frequencies of which were associated with heat stress gradients. As these SNPs might underpin an adaptive role, we characterized the functional roles of the genes located in their genomic region. In each of the studied species, we found heat stress-associated SNPs located in proximity of genes involved in pathways well known to contribute to the cellular responses against heat, such as protein folding, oxidative stress homeostasis, inflammatory and apoptotic pathways, and DNA damage-repair. In some cases, the same candidate molecular targets of heat stress adaptation recurred among species. Together, these results underline the relevance and the power of the seascape genomics approach for the discovery of adaptive traits that could allow corals to persist across wider thermal ranges. © 2021 The Authors.

Among those, copy number variants (CNVs), including duplicated genomic regions and transposable elements (TEs), may contribute to local adaptation and/or reproductive isolation among divergent populations. Those mechanisms suppose that CNVs could be used to infer neutral and/or adaptive population genetic structure, whose study has been restricted to microsatellites, mitochondrial DNA and Amplified fragment length polymorphism markers in the past and more recently the use of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Taking advantage of recent developments allowing CNV analysis from RAD-seq data, we investigated how variation in fitness-related traits, local environmental conditions and demographic history are associated with CNVs, and how subsequent copy number variation drives population genetic structure in a marine fish, the capelin (Mallotus villosus). We collected 1538 DNA samples from 35 sampling sites in the north Atlantic Ocean and identified 6620 putative CNVs. We found associations between CNVs and the gonadosomatic index, suggesting that six duplicated regions could affect female fitness by modulating oocyte production. We also detected 105 CNV candidates associated with water temperature, among which 20% corresponded to genomic regions located within the sequence of protein-coding genes, suggesting local adaptation to cold water by means of gene sequence amplification. We also identified 175 CNVs associated with the divergence of three previously defined parapatric glacial lineages, of which 24% were located within protein-coding genes, making those loci potential candidates for reproductive isolation. Lastly, our analyses unveiled a hierarchical, complex CNV population structure determined by temperature and local geography, which was in stark contrast to that inferred based on SNPs in a previous study. Our findings underline the complementarity of those two types of genomic variation in population genomics studies. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","copy number variants; fish; local adaptation; population genetic structure; reproductive isolation; structural variants; transposable elements","amplified fragment length polymorphism; animal; Atlantic Ocean; copy number variation; demography; female; genetics; genome; single nucleotide polymorphism; Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysis; Animals; Atlantic Ocean; Demography; DNA Copy Number Variations; Female; Genome; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

However, owing to highly similar physiological and biochemical properties, accurate classification and identification of Vibrio strains remains challenging. This hampers further research on the physiology, pathogeny, genomics, epidemics, and ecology of vibrios. Here, we comparatively evaluated multiple approaches including 16S rRNA gene identity, average nucleotide identity (ANI), gene content similarity and mutilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) to investigate their ability in delineating Vibrio strains. In addition, we also evaluated the possibility of applying bacterial prophages in classifying and identifying Vibrio strains. Our results showed that MLSA outperformed other methods in discriminating Vibrio species, suggesting that the other four approaches should be used with cautions in Vibrio delineation. Interestingly, we also found that prophages identified in Vibrio strains were highly specific at strain- and species-level, suggesting that prophages held the potential to be used for microbial species, sub-species, and strain-level identifications.

This article discusses the importance of marine microbial esterases, their biochemical and kinetic properties, and their stability under extreme conditions. Since culture-dependent techniques provide limited insights into microbial diversity of the marine ecosystem, therefore, genomics and metagenomics approaches have widely been adopted in search of novel esterases.

Recently the discovery of several Asfarviridae members other than ASFV has suggested that this family represents a diverse and cosmopolitan group of viruses, but the genomics and distribution of this family have not been studied in detail. To this end we analyzed five complete genomes and 35 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of viruses from this family to shed light on their evolutionary relationships and environmental distribution. The Asfarvirus MAGs derive from diverse marine, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats, underscoring the broad environmental distribution of this family. We present phylogenetic analyses using conserved marker genes and whole-genome comparison of pairwise average amino acid identity (AAI) values, revealing a high level of genomic divergence across disparate Asfarviruses. Further, we found that Asfarviridae genomes encode genes with diverse predicted metabolic roles and detectable sequence homology to proteins in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, highlighting the genomic chimerism that is a salient feature of NCLDV. Our read mapping from Tara oceans metagenomic data also revealed that three Asfarviridae MAGs were present in multiple marine samples, indicating that they are widespread in the ocean. In one of these MAGs we identified four marker genes with > 95% AAI to genes sequenced from a virus that infects the dinoflagellate Heterocapsa circularisquama (HcDNAV). This suggests a potential host for this MAG, which would thereby represent a reference genome of a dinoflagellate-infecting giant virus. Together, these results show that Asfarviridae are ubiquitous, comprise similar sequence divergence as other NCLDV families, and include several members that are widespread in the ocean and potentially infect ecologically important protists. © Copyright © 2021 Karki, Moniruzzaman and Aylward.","Asfarviridae; eukaryotic viruses; Megavirales; NCLDV; Nucleocytoviricota","amino acid; DNA topoisomerase (ATP hydrolysing); fresh water; glycosyltransferase; thioctic acid; transcriptome; African swine fever; African swine fever virus; amino acid metabolism; Amoebozoa; apoptosis; archaeon; Article; Asfarviridae; biogeography; carbohydrate metabolism; chimera; choanoflagellate; Classical swine fever virus; comparative genomics; dinoflagellate; DNA extraction; double-stranded DNA virus; gene expression; gene loss; genetic similarity; genome analysis; genomics; giant virus; glycosylation; habitat; Heterocapsa; marine environment; marker gene; metagenome; metagenomics; mismatch repair; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; oxidative stress; phylogenetic tree; polymerase chain reaction; protist; RNA gene; sequence alignment; sequence homology; signal transduction; ubiquitination; virus genome; virus replication",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Especially, as the centers of biodiversity terrestrial materials input and the energy fluxes between the two oceans, the East Indies Triangle played an important role in spatial distribution and evolution of global marine species. By linking physical and chemical oceanographic conditions, we summarized the phylogeographic patterns of regional marine fauna in the Indo-West Pacific based on mitochondrial and nuclear genomics. (1) In coastal China seas, the Leizhou Peninsula-Hainan Island, glacial exposed Taiwan Strait, Changjiang (Yangtze) River Plume, and old Huanghe (Yellow) River estuary acted as physical barriers and biogeographic boundaries to limit marine organisms' migration among seas. In general, widespread marine species from the South China Sea, East China Sea, Yellow Sea, and Bohai Sea possess a single star-like clade suggesting recent population expansion, and some endemic species in the South China Sea are composed of multiple divergent clades indicating genetic equilibrium population. Furthermore, regional populations showed different population dynamic histories related to different oceanographic conditions between the South China Sea and East China Sea. (2) Along the route of the Kuroshio flowing in the Northwest Pacific Ocean, the main axis and branches of Kuroshio could have acted as biogeographical barriers to limit gene flow of coastal species among mainland China, Ryukyu Islands, main Japanese Islands, and Korean Peninsula. (3) The two clades separated by the Wallace's Line, Huxley's Line, and Indian Ocean-Pacific Ocean's Line were usually observed in marine and anadromous saltwater species from the East Indies Triangle. (4) An across-equatorial gene flow perpendicular to present ocean surface currents was observed in different marine species between the northwest Pacific and southwest Pacific due to north-flowing subsurface current and seasonal reversal of coastal surface current. (5) Some species shared by the East Indian Ocean and West Indian Ocean originated generally from the East Indian Ocean and migrated to West Indian Ocean through transoceanic dispersal carried by the west flowing South Equatorial Current. (6) Two different patterns of genetic structure, viz. genetic homogeneous (stochasticly mixed) population and deeply divergent populations/lineages were often observed in different species from the West Indian Ocean. (7) Bidirectional gene flow could be responsible for shared marine species between the South China Sea and northeastern Indian Ocean. (8) Some evolutional signals of ancient geologic events, palaeo-oceanographic conditions and climatic events can be implicated by phylogeographic histories of different marine species due to co-evolution among them. © 2021, Science Press.

Mechanisms underlying the formation and evolution of marine biodiversity have been explored at the ecological, genetics, and molecular levels with remarkable success. At the ecological level, multiple hypotheses was proposed, including the center of origin hypothesis, the center of accumulation hypothesis, the center of overlap hypothesis, and the center of refuge hypothesis, to explain the pattern of the center of the marine biodiversity formation and dynamic changes. The distribution of marine biodiversity may have been influenced and restrained by geographical and ocean circulations, which drove the formation of geographical patterns such as the Wallacea. At the genetics level, inter- and intra-species hybridization and adaptive radiation can facilitate the recombination of different genotypes and phenotypes, leading to the formation of new species suitable for different ecological niches, and the formation of biodiversity with increased complexity. At the molecular level, mechanisms including chromosomal fusion and fission, polyploidization, chromosome inversion and the formation of super genes, gene duplication, gene family expansion and contraction, horizontal gene transfer, changes of transcriptional elements, the formation of microRNAs can lead to the formation of novel phenotypes, thus driving the formation and alteration of biodiversity center.

This study explored, for the first time, the population genetics of L. nasus at a regional (south-east Pacific Ocean) and global scale. In this study, the null hypotheses of no genetic discontinuities among populations (i) within the SH, and (ii) between the SH and Northern Hemisphere (NH) were tested. Also, the demographic history of L. nasus in different ocean basins was assessed. Two mitochondrial markers (Control Region [CR] and cox1) well suited for population genetics inferences in sharks were used. Spatial–genetic analyses suggested two genetic clusters co-occurring in the south-eastern Pacific Ocean. A two-way ANOVA using the cox1 but not the CR mtDNA fragment detected an effect of genetic identity on shark body size. Phylogeographic analyses, haplotype networks, and analyses of molecular variance demonstrated genetic differences between populations from the NH and SH but not among populations in the SH. Migration estimates indicated limited current maternal gene flow between the two hemispheres but high gene flow within hemispheres. Two well-defined haplotype groups with star-like shapes inhabited all ocean basins in the SH. These results could reflect a historical scenario of reproductive isolation and more recent mixture among previously isolated populations in the SH. A Bayesian skyline plot analysis indicated sudden population expansion in the SH occurring ~100–125 kya. This study highlights the need for additional studies focusing on the population genomics (using nuclear markers, i.e. single nucleotide polymorphisms) and the general biology of L. nasus to explore the existence of genetically dissimilar populations in the SH.

Living organisms inhabiting these environments have developed peculiar mechanisms to cope with extreme conditions, in such a way that they mark the chemical-physical boundaries of life on Earth. Studying such mechanisms is stimulating from a basic research viewpoint and because of biotechnological applications. Pseudoalteromonas species are a group of marine gamma-proteobacteria frequently isolated from a range of extreme environments, including cold habitats and deep-sea sediments. Since deep-sea floors constitute almost 60% of the Earth's surface and cold temperatures represent the most common of the extreme conditions, the genus Pseudoalteromonas can be considered one of the most important model systems for studying microbial adaptation. Particularly, among all Pseudoalteromonas representatives, P. haloplanktis TAC125 has recently gained a central role. This bacterium was isolated from seawater sampled along the Antarctic ice-shell and is considered one of the model organisms of cold-adapted bacteria. It is capable of thriving in a wide temperature range and it has been suggested as an alternative host for the soluble overproduction of heterologous proteins, given its ability to rapidly multiply at low temperatures. In this review, we will present an overview of the recent advances in the characterization of Pseudoalteromonas strains and, more importantly, in the understanding of their evolutionary and chemical-physical strategies to face such a broad array of extreme conditions.

Additionally, Hi-C scaffolding of the genome resulted in 24 chromosomes containing 96.93% of the total assembled sequences. A total of 23,959 protein-coding genes were predicted in the genome, and 96.51% of the genes were functionally annotated in public databases. A total of 71.86 Mb repetitive elements were detected, accounting for 13.78% of the genome. The phylogenetic relationships of silver sillago with other teleosts showed that silver sillago was separated from the common ancestor of Sillago sinica ∼7.92 Ma. Comparative genomic analysis of silver sillago with other teleosts showed that 45 unique and 100 expansion gene families were identified in silver sillago. In this study, the genomic resources provide valuable reference genomes for functional genomics research of silver sillago. © The Author(s) 2020.

Protistology 10:148–157, 2016) belongs to one of the early diverging microsporidian groups, the metchnikovellids (Microsporidia: Metchnikovellidae). In relation to typical (‘core’) microsporidia, this group is considered primitive. The spores of metchnikovellids have no classical polar sac-anchoring disk complex, no coiled polar tube, no posterior vacuole, and no polaroplast. Instead, they possess a short thick manubrium that expands into a manubrial cistern. These organisms are hyperparasites; they infect gregarines that parasitise marine invertebrates. M. dogieli is a parasite of the archigregarine Selenidium pygospionis (Paskerova et al. Protist 169:826–852, 2018), which parasitises the polychaete Pygospio elegans. This species was discovered in samples collected in the silt littoral zone at the coast of the White Sea, North-West Russia, and was described based on light microscopy. No molecular data are available for this species, and the publicly accessible genomic data for metchnikovellids are limited to two species: M. incurvata Caullery & Mesnil, 1914 and Amphiamblys sp. WSBS2006. In the present study, we applied single-cell genomics methods with whole-genome amplification to perform next-generation sequencing of M. dogieli genomic DNA. We performed a phylogenetic analysis based on the SSU rRNA gene and reconstructed a multigene phylogeny using a concatenated alignment that included 46 conserved single-copy protein domains. The analyses recovered a fully supported clade of metchnikovellids as a basal group to the core microsporidia. Two members of the genus Metchnikovella did not form a clade in our tree.

An increasing body of literature reports TOCs including emerging contaminants in the funeral industry, but comprehensive reviews of the evidence are still lacking. Hence, evidence was analysed to address the proposition that, the funeral industry constitutes several hotspot reservoirs of a wide spectrum of TOCs posing ecological and human health risks. TOCs detected include embalming products, persistent organic pollutants, synthetic pesticides, pharmaceuticals, personal care products and illicit drugs. Human cadavers, solid wastes, wastewaters and air-borne particulates from autopsy, thanatopraxy care facilities (mortuaries, funeral homes), cemeteries and crematoria are hotspots of TOCs. Ingestion of contaminated water, and aquatic and marine foods constitutes non-occupational human exposure, while occupational exposure occurs via inhalation and dermal intake. Risk factors promoting exposure to TOCs include unhygienic burial practices, poor solid waste and wastewater disposal, and weak and poorly enforced regulations. The generic health risks of TOCs are quite diverse, and include; (1) genotoxicity, endocrine disruption, teratogenicity and neurodevelopmental disorders, (2) development of antimicrobial resistance, (3) info-disruption via biomimicry, and (4) disruption of ecosystem functions and trophic interactions. Barring formaldehyde and inferential evidence, the epidemiological studies linking TOCs in the funeral industry to specific health outcomes are scarce. The reasons for the lack of evidence, and limitations of current health risk assessment protocols are discussed. A comprehensive framework for hazard identification, risk assessment and mitigation (HIRAM) in the funeral industry is proposed. The HIRAM includes regulatory, surveillance and control systems such as prevention and removal of TOCs. Future directions on the ecotoxicology of mixtures, behaviour, and health risks of TOCs are highlighted. The opportunities presented by emerging tools, including isotopic labelling, genomics, big data analytics (e.g., machine learning), and in silico techniques in toxicokinetic modelling are highlighted. © 2020","Embalming products; Emerging contaminants; Human exposure pathways; Mitigation framework; Pharmaceuticals; Thanatopraxy","Advanced Analytics; Biomimetics; Contamination; Data Analytics; Health; Health risks; Man machine systems; Organic pollutants; Public works; Reservoirs (water); Solid wastes; Wastewater disposal; Water pollution; Antimicrobial resistances; Endocrine disruption; Epidemiological studies; Hazard identification; Occupational exposure; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Personal care products; Trophic interactions; Risk assessment; embalming product; endocrine disruptor; environmental, industrial and domestic chemicals; formaldehyde; illicit drug; pesticide; toxic organic contaminant; unclassified drug; pesticide; cemetery; drug; health risk; mitigation; occupational exposure; public health; service quality; service sector; toxic substance; antibiotic resistance; autopsy; cadaver; cemetery; concentration (parameter); crematorium; exposure; genomics; genotoxicity; health hazard; human; isotope labeling; mental disease; morgue; posthumous care; priority journal; Review; risk assessment; risk factor; solid waste; teratogenicity; thanatopraxy; waste water; water contamination; analysis; autopsy; cemetery; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; toxicity; water pollutant; Autopsy; Cemeteries; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Pesticides; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Review,"",Scopus

They infect almost every species and are probably the most abundant biological entities on the planet, yet they are excluded from the Tree of Life (ToL). However, there can be no doubt that viruses play a significant role in evolution, the force that facilitates all life on Earth. Conceptually, viruses are regarded by many as non-living entities that hijack living cells in order to propagate. A strict separation between living and non-living entities places viruses far from the ToL, but this may be theoretically unsound. Advances in sequencing technology and comparative genomics have expanded our understanding of the evolutionary relationships between viruses and cellular organisms. Genomic and metagenomic data have revealed that co-evolution between viral and cellular genomes involves frequent horizontal gene transfer and the occasional co-option of novel functions over evolutionary time. From the giant, ameba-infecting marine viruses to the tiny Porcine circovirus harboring only two genes, viruses and their cellular hosts are ecologically and evolutionarily intertwined. When deciding how, if, and where viruses should be placed on the ToL, we should remember that the Tree functions best as a model of biological evolution on Earth, and it is important that models themselves evolve with our increasing understanding of biological systems. © Copyright © 2021 Harris and Hill.","evolution; horizontal gene transfer; phylogeny; Tree of Life; viruses","cellular organism; Circovirus; coevolution; comparative genomics; horizontal gene transfer; metagenomics; nonhuman; review; tree of life; virus genome",Review,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

The user interface gives access to genomic characteristics, accession numbers as well as an interactive map showing strain isolation sites. The main entry to the database is through search for a term (gene name, product, etc.), resulting in a list of CLOGs and individual genes. Each CLOG benefits from a rich functional annotation including EggNOG, EC/K numbers, GO terms, TIGR Roles, custom-designed Cyanorak Roles as well as several protein motif predictions. Cyanorak also displays a phyletic profile, indicating the genotype and pigment type for each CLOG, and a genome viewer (Jbrowse) to visualize additional data on each genome such as predicted operons, genomic islands or transcriptomic data, when available.

Recent advances in genomics are greatly accelerating our understanding of cyanobacterial taxonomy. Genomes available in NCBI’s GenBank were selected to comprehensively clarify the genetic similarities and differences of representatives of genus Phormidium and Phormidesmis priestleyi ULC007 (former Phormidium priestleyi). We performed a comparative genomic analysis, which includes analysis of genome characteristics and annotation of the subsystem, classification of functionally annotated common genes and automatic annotation of secondary metabolic gene clusters. Results showed that about 83% of the genes in the studied cyanobacterial genomes were identified as genes with unknown functions, and those with annotated functions were mainly involved in: (I) cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, and pigments; (II) cell wall and capsule; (III) RNA metabolism; (IV) protein metabolism; (V) DNA metabolism, (VI) fatty acids, lipids, and isoprenoids; (VII) respiration; (VIII) stress response; (IX) amino acids and derivatives; and (X) carbohydrates We found that Phormidesmis priestleyi ULC007 possess seven genes involved in the chemotaxis.

The edible cockle (Cerastoderma edule) is a marine bivalve distributed along the Northeast Atlantic coast of Europe and is an important resource from both commercial and ecological perspectives. We performed a population genomics screening using 2b-RAD genotyping on 9309 SNPs localized in the cockle's genome on a sample of 536 specimens pertaining to 14 beds in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean to analyse the genetic structure with regard to environmental variables. Larval dispersal modelling considering species behaviour and interannual/interseasonal variation in ocean conditions was carried out as an essential background to which compare genetic information. Cockle populations in the Northeast Atlantic displayed low but significant geographical differentiation between populations (FST = 0.0240; p &lt; 0.001), albeit not across generations. We identified 742 and 36 outlier SNPs related to divergent and balancing selection in all the geographical scenarios inspected, and sea temperature and salinity were the main environmental correlates suggested. Highly significant linkage disequilibrium was detected at specific genomic regions against the very low values observed across the whole genome. Two main genetic groups were identified, northwards and southwards of French Brittany. Larval dispersal modelling suggested a barrier for larval dispersal linked to the Ushant front that could explain these two genetic clusters. Further genetic subdivision was observed using outlier loci and considering larval advection. The northern group was divided into the Irish/Celtic Seas and the English Channel/North Sea, while the southern group was divided into three subgroups.

Characteristics concerning physiology, genomics, and metatranscriptomics were analyzed. Physiologically, the fitting model predicted photosynthesis indications and pigment contents increased with different trends following the light intensity. Genomic sequencing demonstrated that both the phylogenetic and phenotypic compositions of Synechococcus assemblage exhibited population succession. Especially, the proportion of Synechococcus pigment type 2 was changed significantly. In metatranscriptomics, most genes were downregulated in the high-light intensity group, while photosynthesis-related genes were entirely upregulated.

Hence, they are not a taxonomic unit, but rather represent a fungal lifestyle shared by several unrelated lineages. Although the discovery of new yeast species occurs at an increasing speed, at the current rate it will likely take hundreds of years, if ever, before they will all be documented. Many parts of the earth, including many threatened habitats, remain unsampled for yeasts and many others are only superficially studied. Cold habitats, such as glaciers, are home to a specific community of cold-adapted yeasts, and, hence, there is some urgency to study such environments at locations where they might disappear soon due to anthropogenic climate change. The same is true for yeast communities in various natural forests that are impacted by deforestation and forest conversion. Many countries of the so-called Global South have not been sampled for yeasts, despite their economic promise. However, extensive research activity in Asia, especially China, has yielded many taxonomic novelties. Comparative genomics studies have demonstrated the presence of yeast species with a hybrid origin, many of them isolated from clinical or industrial environments.

Despite the fact that most efforts have focused on viral macrodiversity, little is known about the microdiversity of ecologically important viruses on Earth. Recently, single-virus genomics discovered the putatively most abundant ocean virus in temperate and tropical waters: the uncultured dsDNA virus vSAG 37-F6 infecting Pelagibacter, the most abundant marine bacteria. In this study, we report the cooccurrence of up to ≈1,500 different viral strains (>95% nucleotide identity) and ≈30 related species (80-95% nucleotide identity) in a single oceanic sample. Viral microdiversity was maintained over space and time, and most alleles were the result of synonymous mutations without any apparent adaptive benefits to cope with host translation codon bias and efficiency. Gene flow analysis used to delimitate species according to the biological species concept (BSC) revealed the impact of recombination in shaping vSAG 37-F6 virus and Pelagibacter speciation. Data demonstrated that this large viral microdiversity somehow mirrors the host species diversity since ≈50% of the 926 analyzed Pelagibacter genomes were found to belong to independent BSC species that do not significantly engage in gene flow with one another. The host range of this evolutionarily successful virus revealed that a single viral species can infect multiple Pelagibacter BSC species, indicating that this virus crosses not only formal BSC barriers but also biomes since viral ancestors are found in freshwater. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to International Society for Microbial Ecology.",,,Article,"",Scopus

Capturing these impacts remains challenging for marine fishes which disperse over large geographical scales spanning steep environmental gradients. It requires the extensive spatial sampling of individuals or populations, representative of seascape heterogeneity, combined with a set of highly informative molecular markers capable of revealing climatic-associated genetic variations. We explored how space, dispersal and environment shape the genomic patterns of two sympatric fish species in the Mediterranean Sea, which ranks among the oceanic basins most affected by climate change and human pressure. We hypothesized that the population structure and climate-associated genomic signatures of selection would be stronger in the less mobile species, as restricted gene flow tends to facilitate the fixation of locally adapted alleles. To test our hypothesis, we genotyped two species with contrasting dispersal abilities: the white seabream Diplodus sargus and the striped red mullet Mullus surmuletus. We collected 823 individuals and used genotyping by sequencing (GBS) to detect 8,206 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for the seabream and 2,794 for the mullet. For each species, we identified highly differentiated genomic regions (i.e. outliers) and disentangled the relative contribution of space, dispersal and environmental variables (climate, marine primary productivity) on the outliers' genetic structure to test the prevalence of gene flow and local adaptation. We observed contrasting patterns of gene flow and adaptive genetic variation between the two species. The seabream showed a distinct Alboran sea population and panmixia across the Mediterranean Sea. The mullet revealed additional differentiation within the Mediterranean Sea that was significantly correlated to summer and winter temperatures, as well as marine primary productivity. Functional annotation of the climate-associated outlier SNPs then identified candidate genes involved in heat tolerance that could be examined to further predict species' responses to climate change. Our results illustrate the key steps of a comparative seascape genomics study aiming to unravel the evolutionary processes at play in marine species, to better anticipate their response to climate change. Defining population adaptation capacities and environmental niches can then serve to incorporate evolutionary processes into species conservation planning. © 2021 British Ecological Society","climate change; comparative seascape genomics; gene flow; local adaptation; Mediterranean Sea",,Article,"",Scopus

Zostera marina (eelgrass) plays a crucial role in the functioning of coastal marine ecosystems and global carbon sequestration. It is the most widely studied seagrass and has become a marine model system for exploring adaptation under rapid climate change. The original draft genome (v.1.0) of the seagrass Z. marina (L.) was based on a combination of Illumina mate-pair libraries and fosmid-ends. A total of 25.55 Gb of Illumina and 0.14 Gb of Sanger sequence was obtained representing 47.7× genomic coverage. The assembly resulted in ~2000 unordered scaffolds (L50 of 486 Kb), a final genome assembly size of 203MB, 20,450 protein coding genes and 63% TE content. Here, we present an upgraded chromosome-scale genome assembly and compare v.1.0 and the new v.3.1, reconfirming previous results from Olsen et al. (2016), as well as pointing out new findings. Methods: The same high molecular weight DNA used in the original sequencing of the Finnish clone was used. A high-quality reference genome was assembled with the MECAT assembly pipeline combining PacBio long-read sequencing and Hi-C scaffolding. Results: In total, 75.97 Gb PacBio data was produced. The final assembly comprises six pseudo-chromosomes and 304 unanchored scaffolds with a total length of 260.5Mb and an N50 of 34.6 MB, showing high contiguity and few gaps (~0.5%). 21,483 protein-encoding genes are annotated in this assembly, of which 20,665 (96.2%) obtained at least one functional assignment based on similarity to known proteins. Conclusions: As an important marine angiosperm, the improved Z. marina genome assembly will further assist evolutionary, ecological, and comparative genomics at the chromosome level. The new genome assembly will further our understanding into the structural and physiological adaptations from land to marine life. © 2021 Ma X et al.","Annotation; Chromosome-scale genome assembly; Eelgrass; Seagrass; Zostera marina","angiosperm; article; chromosome; comparative genomics; controlled study; fosmid; library; molecular weight; nonhuman; physiological adaptation; pipeline; seagrass; chromosome; ecosystem; genetics; genome; molecular genetics; Zosteraceae; Chromosomes; Ecosystem; Genome; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Zosteraceae",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

This study used comparative genomics to identify genetic factors that delineate environmental and clinical V. parahaemolyticus population and understand the similarities and differences between the T3SS2 phylotypes. The comparative analysis revealed the presence of a cluster of genes belonging to bacterial cellulose synthesis (bcs) in isolates of environmental origin. This cluster, previously unreported in V. parahaemolyticus, exhibit significant similarity to that of Aliivibrio fischeri, and might dictate a potentially new mechanism of its environmental adaptation and persistence. The study also identified many genes predicted in silico to be T3SS effectors that are unique to T3SS2β of tdh−trh+ and tdh+trh+ pathotype and having no identifiable homologue in tdh+trh− T3SS2α.

Streptomyces appears as one of the main sources of these enzymes, but complete genome sequences of keratinolytic bacteria are still limited. This article reports the complete genomes of three marine-derived streptomycetes that show different levels of feather keratin degradation, with high (strain G11C), low (strain CHD11), and no (strain Vc74B-19) keratinolytic activity. A multi-step bioinformatics approach is described to explore genes encoding putative keratinases in these genomes. Despite their differential keratinolytic activity, multiplatform annotation reveals similar quantities of ORFs encoding putative proteases in strains G11C, CHD11, and Vc74B-19. Comparative genomics classified these putative proteases into 140 orthologous groups and 17 unassigned orthogroup peptidases belonging to strain G11C. Similar network analysis reveals three network communities of putative peptidases related to known keratinases of the peptidase families S01, S08, and M04. When combined with the prediction of cellular localization and phylogenetic reconstruction, seven putative keratinases from the highly keratinolytic strain Streptomyces sp. G11C are identified.

This is despite the presence of CO2-concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) in some species that maximize inorganic carbon uptake. We investigated the effects of inorganic carbon on the seasonal distribution, growth rates and photosynthesis of a freshwater diatom, Asterionella formosa, and the nature of its CCM using genomics. In a productive lake, the frequency of A. formosa declined with CO2 concentration below air-equilibrium. In contrast, CO2 concentrations at 2.5-times air-equilibrium did not increase growth rate, cell C-quota or the ability to remove inorganic carbon. A pH-drift experiment strongly suggested that HCO3− as well as CO2 could be used. Calculations combining hourly inorganic carbon concentrations in a lake with known CO2 and HCO3− uptake kinetics suggested that rates of photosynthesis of A. formosa would be approximately carbon saturated and largely dependent on CO2 uptake when CO2 was at or above air-equilibrium. However, during summer carbon depletion, HCO3− would be the major form of carbon taken up and carbon saturation will fall to around 30%. Genes encoding proteins involved in CCMs were identified in the nuclear genome of A. formosa. We found carbonic anhydrases from subclasses α, β, γ and θ, as well as solute carriers from families 4 and 26 involved in HCO3− transport, but no periplasmic carbonic anhydrase. A model of the components of the CCM and their location in A. formosa showed that they are more similar to Phaeodactylum tricornutum than to Thalassiosira pseudonana, two marine diatoms. © 2021 International Phycological Society.","Aquatic photosynthesis; Bicarbonate use; Carbonic anhydrase; CO2-concentrating mechanism; Solute carrier (SLC)",,Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

Although qPCR achieved lower quantification limits, the metagenomic method avoided biases caused by primer specificity inherent to qPCR-based methods and was able to detect orders of magnitude more genes than is possible with qPCR assays. We used the approach to simultaneously quantify ARGs in the Comprehensive Antimicrobial Resistance Database (CARD). We observed that the total abundance of tetracycline resistance genes was consistent across different stages of manure treatment on three farms, but different samples were dominated by different tetracycline resistance gene families.

Although studying marine evolutionary processes is often challenging, recent technological advances in different fields, from maritime engineering to genomics, are making it increasingly possible to study speciation of marine life forms across diverse ecosystems and taxa. Motivated by recent research in the field, including the 14 contributions in this issue, we highlight and discuss six axes of research that we think will deepen our understanding of speciation in the marine realm: (a) study a broader range of marine environments and organisms; (b) identify the reproductive barriers driving speciation between marine taxa; (c) understand the role of different genomic architectures underlying reproductive isolation; (d) infer the evolutionary history of divergence using model-based approaches; (e) study patterns of hybridization and introgression between marine taxa; and (f) implement highly interdisciplinary, collaborative research programmes.

Standard test methods are available for biodegradation that employ either natural inocula or defined communities, the latter being preferred for standardization and comparability. The original marine biodegradation standard test method ASTM D6691 employed such a defined consortium for testing PHA biodegradation. However, the taxonomic composition and metabolic potential of this consortium have never been confirmed using DNA sequencing technologies. To this end, we revived available members of this consortium and determined their phylogenetic placement, genomic sequence content, and metabolic potential. The revived members belonged to the Bacillaceae, Rhodobacteraceae, and Vibrionaceae families. Using a comparative genomics approach, we found all the necessary enzymes for both PHA production and utilization in most of the members.

We have collected all the available genomes in databases to assess the diversity included in this group and analyzed it by comparative genomics. We have found the equivalent of five genera and 18 genomospecies. They have genome reduction parameters equal to those of freshwater actinobacterial ""Candidatus Nanopelagicales""or marine alphaproteobacterial Pelagibacterales. Genome recruitment shows that they are found only in the photic zone and mainly in surface waters, with only one genus that is found preferentially at or below the deep chlorophyll maximum. ""Ca. Actinomarinales""show a highly conserved core genome (80% of the gene families conserved for the whole order) with a saturation of genomic diversity of the flexible genome at the genomospecies level. We found only a flexible genomic island preserved throughout the order; it is related to the sugar decoration of the envelope and uses several tRNAs as hot spots to increase its genomic diversity. Populations had a discrete level of sequence diversity similar to other marine microbes but drastically different from the much higher levels found for Pelagibacterales. Genomic analysis suggests that they are all aerobic photoheterotrophs with one type 1 rhodopsin and a heliorhodopsin. Like other actinobacteria, they possess the F420 coenzyme biosynthesis pathway, and its lower reduction potential could provide access to an increased range of redox chemical transformations.

Here, we study 182 genomes belonging to the only known exclusively marine pelagic group of the phylum Actinobacteria.

Driven by the recent climatic changes, rapid northward shifts of species’ distribution ranges can potentially modify the phylogeographic signature of Last Glacial Maximum. We explored this question in detail in the cold-tolerant kelp species Saccharina latissima, using microsatellites and double digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing ( ddRAD-seq) derived single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to analyze the genetic diversity and structure in 11 sites spanning the entire European Atlantic latitudinal range of this species. In addition, we checked for statistical correlation between genetic marker allele frequencies and three environmental proxies (sea surface temperature, salinity, and water turbidity). Our findings revealed that genetic diversity was significantly higher for the northernmost locality (Spitsbergen) compared to the southern ones (Northern Iberia), which we discuss in light of the current state of knowledge on phylogeography of S. latissima and the potential influence of the recent climatic changes on the population structure of this species. Seven SNPs and 12 microsatellite alleles were found to be significantly associated with at least one of the three environmental variables. We speculate on the putative adaptive functions of the genes associated with the outlier markers and the importance of these markers for successful conservation and aquaculture strategies for S. latissima in this age of rapid global change. © 2020 by the authors.

Because of their peculiar physico-chemical features, NPs are accumulated in marine organisms, which suffer a variety of adverse effects. In particular, bivalve mollusks represent a unique target for NPs, mainly because they are suspension-feeders with highly developed processes for cellular internalization of nano-and micrometric particles. Several studies have demonstrated that the uptake and the accumulation of NPs can induce sub-lethal effects towards marine bivalves. However, to understand the real risk of NP exposures the application of the so-called “omics” techniques (e.g., proteomics, genomics, metabolomics, lipidomics) has been suggested. In particular, proteomics has been used to study the effects of NPs and their mechanism(s) of action in marine bivalves, but to date its application is still limited. The present review aims at summarizing the state of the art concerning the application of proteomics as a tool to investigate the effects of nanoparticles on the proteome of marine bivalves, and to critically discuss the advantages and limitations of proteomics in this field of research. Relying on results obtained by studies that applied proteomics on bivalve tissues, proteomics application needs to be considered cautiously as a promising and valuable tool to shed light on toxicity and mechanism(s) of action of NPs. Although on one hand, the analysis of the current literature demonstrated undeniable strengths, potentiality and reliability of proteomics, on the other hand a number of limitations suggest that some gaps of knowledge need to be bridged, and methodological and technical improvements are necessary before proteomics can be readily and routinely applied to nanotoxicology studies. © 2020 by the authors.

We grouped data into five categories: 1) biological information, 2) conservation status, 3) management opportunities, 4) use, and 5) inclusion in international conventions and treaties. For species biological information, we included migration, habitat, species characteristics such as length & body weight, their threat to humans, life-history trait data availability from FishBase, whether the species was listed on the Global Register of Migratory Species, the presence of occurrence data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), information on genomics from GenBank, and species evolutionary distinctiveness scores. For conservation status, we recorded threat status from the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species™ and inclusion in the Alliance for Zero Extinction (AZE). For management opportunities, we identified species under human care in zoos and aquariums in the Species360 network, species under management in studbooks from the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA), the American Association for Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), and the Zoo and Aquarium Association Australasia (ZAA), as well as data on recovery, management, and action plans at the class, family, and species levels.

The mosquitoes Aedes albopictus (Skuse) and Ae. aegypti (Linnaeus) are both highly invasive disease vectors, and through a series of ongoing international incursions are continuing to colonize new regions and spread insecticide resistance alleles among established populations. This study uses high-resolution molecular markers and a set of 241 reference genotypes to trace incursion pathways of Ae. albopictus into mainland Australia, where no successful invasions have yet been observed. We contrast these results with incursion pathways of Ae. aegypti, investigated previously. RESULTS: Assignments successfully identified China, Japan, Singapore and Taiwan as source locations. Incursion pathways of Ae. albopictus were entirely different to those of Ae. aegypti, despite broad sympatry of these species throughout the Indo-Pacific region. Incursions of Ae. albopictus appeared to have come predominantly along marine routes from key trading locations, while Ae. aegypti was mostly linked to aerial routes from tourism hotspots. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate how genomics can help decipher otherwise cryptic incursion pathways. The inclusion of reference genotypes from the Americas may help resolve some unsuccessful assignments. While many congeneric taxa will share common incursion pathways, this study highlights that this is not always the case, and incursion pathways of important taxa should be specifically investigated. Species differences in aerial and marine incursion rates may reflect the efficacy of ongoing control programmes such as aircraft disinsection. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry","Aedes aegypti; Aedes albopictus; assignment tests; biological invasions; genome-wide SNPs; incursion pathways","allele; colonization; disease vector; genetic marker; genotype; invasive species; mosquito; native species; sympatry; yellow fever; Australia; China; Japan; Singapore; Taiwan; Aedes aegypti; Aedes albopictus; Aedes; animal; Australia; China; genetics; Japan; mosquito vector; Taiwan; Western Hemisphere; yellow fever; Aedes; Americas; Animals; Australia; China; Japan; Mosquito Vectors; Taiwan; Yellow Fever",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

These include studies on environment-induced phenotypic plasticity and associated ecological adaptation; population genetic variation and structuring driven by ecological variation; and ecological consequences mediated by intraspecific and interspecific diversity. Knowledge gaps are also discussed that impede the connection of ecology and genetics in macrophytes and possible approaches to address these issues.

Genomics-assisted aquaculture can increase yield while preserving the environment to ensure sufficient and sustainable production for global food security. However, only few high-quality genome sequences of marine organisms, especially shellfish, are available to the public partly because of the difficulty in the sequence assembly due to the complex nature of their genomes. A key step for a successful genome sequencing is the preparation of high-quality high molecular weight (HMW) genomic DNA. This study evaluated the effectiveness of five DNA extraction protocols (CTAB, Genomic-tip, Mollusc DNA, TIANamp Marine Animals DNA, and Sbeadex livestock kits) in obtaining shrimp HMW DNA for a long-read sequencing platform. DNA samples were assessed for quality and quantity using a Qubit fluorometer, NanoDrop spectrophotometer and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Among the five extraction methods examined without further optimization, the Genomic-tip kit yielded genomic DNA with the highest quality. However, further modifications of these established protocols might yield even better DNA quality and quantity. To further investigate whether the obtained genomic DNA could be used in a long-read sequencing application, DNA samples from the top three extraction methods (CTAB method, Genomic-tip and Mollusc DNA kits) were used for Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) library construction and sequencing. Genomic DNA obtained from Genomic-tip and Mollusc DNA kits allowed successful library construction, while the DNA obtained from the CTAB method did not. Genomic DNA isolated using the Genomic-tip kit yielded a higher number of long reads (N50 of 14.57 Kb) than those obtained from Mollusc DNA kits (N50 of 9.74 Kb). Thus, this study identified an effective extraction method for high-quality HMW genomic DNA of shrimp that can be applied to other marine organisms for a long-read sequencing platform. © 2020 Angthong et al.","DNA extraction method; Long-read sequencing platform; Marine organism","2 propanol; cetrimide; genomic DNA; liquid nitrogen; mercaptoethanol; proteinase K; quantum dot; ribonuclease; animal experiment; Article; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; DNA extraction; DNA purification; drug efficacy; gel electrophoresis; livestock; marine species; molecular weight; mollusc; nonhuman; pulsed field gel electrophoresis; sequence analysis; shrimp",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Newly isolated strains and sequenced genomes in the last two decades have substantially advanced our knowledge of their host diversity, gene functions, and evolutionary history. Giant viruses are now known to infect hosts from all major supergroups in the eukaryotic tree of life, which predominantly comprises microbial organisms. The seven well-recognized viral clades (taxonomic families) have drastically different host range. Mimiviridae and Phycodnaviridae, both with notable intrafamilial genome variation and high abundance in environmental samples, have members that infect the most diverse eukaryotic lineages. Laboratory experiments and comparative genomics have shed light on the unprecedented functional potential of giant viruses, encoding proteins for genetic information flow, energy metabolism, synthesis of biomolecules, membrane transport, and sensing that allow for sophisticated control of intracellular conditions and cell-environment interactions. Evolutionary genomics can illuminate how current and past hosts shape viral gene repertoires, although it becomes more obscure with divergent sequences and deep phylogenies.

ORF-1 encodes a polyprotein, with three computationally discernible functional domains: viral methyltransferase; viral helicase; and RNA-directed RNA polymerase. The remaining ORFs encode a transmembrane protein, a capsid protein and a protein of undetermined function. The raw transcriptomic data reveal a low level of background single nucleotide mutations within the data. Comparison of the protein sequence data and synteny with other viral isolates reveals that the greatest protein similarity (<39%) is shared with the Negevirus group, a group that exclusively infects insects. Phylogenetic assessment of the individual polyprotein domains revealed a mixed prediction of phylogenetic origins, suggesting with low confidence that the novel +ssRNA virus could be present in multiple places throughout the individual gene trees. A concatenated approach strongly suggested that this new virus is an early diverging isolate, branching before the Negevirus and Cilevirus groups.

Previous studies have reported sucrose-utilizing isolates (Scr+), but the genetic basis of this variable phenotype remains uncharacterized. Here, we carried out the genome sequencing of five Scr+ and two Scr− Pdd isolates and conducted a comparative genomics analysis with sixteen additional Pdd genomes sequenced in previous studies. We identified two different versions of a four-gene cluster (scr cluster) exclusive of Scr+ isolates encoding a PTS system sucrose-specific IIBC component (scrA), a fructokinase (scrK), a sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase (scrB), and a sucrose operon repressor (scrR). A scrA deletion mutant did not ferment sucrose and was impaired for growth with sucrose as carbon source. Comparative genomics analyses suggested that scr clusters were acquired by horizontal transfer by different lineages of Pdd and were inserted into a recombination hot-spot in the Pdd genome. The incongruence of phylogenies based on housekeeping genes and on scr genes revealed that phylogenetically diverse gene clusters for sucrose utilization have undergone extensive horizontal transfer among species of Vibrio and Photobacterium. © 2020 by the authors.

First, a brief overview of early investigations of organic geochemistry in ODZs sets the stage for follow-on work. Second, linkages between organic biomarkers and microbial and geochemical processes are described for three key biogeochemical processes that are characteristic of ODZs: (i) oxidation of ammonium by archaea and anammox bacteria; (ii) redox cycles of metals and sulfur; (iii) the methane cycle.

Information about marine invertebrate's neutral mAPs properties is scarce; available data are mainly derived from genomics and cDNA studies. The goal of this work was to characterize the biochemical properties of the neutral APs activities in eight Cuban marine invertebrate species from the Phyla Mollusca, Porifera, Echinodermata, and Cnidaria. Determination of substrate specificity, optimal pH and effects of inhibitors (1,10-phenanthroline, amastatin, and bestatin) and cobalt on activity led to the identification of distinct neutral AP-like activities, whose biochemical behaviors were similar to those of the M1 and M17 families of mAPs. Additionally, M18-like glutamyl AP activities were detected.

They are small sized and relatively easy to breed in specific husbandries, unlike the large-sized marine fish used for aquaculture. Because they live in highly structured social groups in sea anemones, anemonefish allow addressing a series of relevant scientific questions such as the social control of growth and sex change, the mechanisms controlling symbiosis, the establishment and variation of complex color patterns, and the regulation of aging.

Current best practice seeks to restore populations by transplanting donor individuals chosen to replicate genetic diversity and structure of extant, nearby populations. However, genetic characteristics are rarely empirically examined across generations, despite their potential role in influencing restoration success. We used genomics to design a restoration program for lost underwater forests of Phyllospora comosa, a dominant forest-forming macroalga that went locally extinct from reefs off Sydney, Australia. Population genetic diversity and structure of nearby extant populations informed choice of donor sites. We tested whether donor provenance influenced adult transplant survival, condition (via metrics of epibiosis) and the genetic characteristics of recruits at restoration sites. Extant populations of Phyllospora within a 100-km radius of Sydney comprised three distinct genetic clusters with similar levels of genetic diversity. We transplanted reproductive adults from two of these sites, with the aim of restoring five Phyllospora forests with levels of genetic structure and diversity similar to donor populations. Donor provenance influenced survival and condition of transplanted adults and recruitment levels varied significantly among restoration sites. Yet, recruitment was rapid and genetic diversity and structure of the F1 generation resembled extant populations. This likely occurred because transplanted individuals reproduced synchronously and rapidly post-transplantation, prior to mortality of adult donor transplants. Synthesis and applications. As restoration and the need to ‘future-proof’ marine ecosystems increase globally, it will be critical to understand and harness the role of donor provenance, genetic diversity and structure in restoration success. By incorporating ecological and genomic data into restoration design and assessment, this study demonstrates that evidence-based selection of macroalgal donors can result in F1 generation recruits with similar levels of genetic diversity and structure as extant populations, despite an effect of provenance on transplant survival and condition. This study also highlights the need for ongoing refinement of transplantation techniques to ensure future recruitment success. © 2020 British Ecological Society","climate change; genetic diversity; genomics; kelp; marine ecology; restoration; seaweed; SNPs","design method; ecosystem service; environmental degradation; environmental restoration; genetic structure; genetic variation; genomics; habitat loss; macroalga; performance assessment; underwater environment; Sydney [New South Wales]; Phyllospora; Phyllospora comosa",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus

A variety of technical and conceptual developments, particularly in the last decade have revolutionized the field of microbiology, redrawing the landscape, and entirely redefining what is possible. Perhaps this paradigm shift is no more apparent than in the study of vibrios. The family Vibrionaceae are almost unique as a group of bacteria to study in microbiology: they are genomically, phylogenetically and functionally diverse yet a distinct group of environmental bacteria encompassing important human and animal pathogens as well as non-pathogenic species such as ecologically critical symbionts. Sensitive to physiochemical stimuli, they are among the fasting replicating bacteria studied, capable of responding almost immediately to favourable environmental conditions such as those afforded by climate warming. Characterized by an unusual double chromosome and frequently carrying numerous cryptic plasmids – their genomes are often pockmarked with insertion elements, transposons, prophages and integrases – paying testament to past genomic promiscuity. With a strong affinity for environmental niches in freshwater and marine systems, they are among the most numerous bacteria present in our oceans, coasts and freshwater environments. As such they offer something for almost anyone interested in microbiology and represent an excellent example of field of microbiology that has benefitted hugely by advances across a gamut of disciplines – not just microbiological – but encompassing genomics, genetics, oceanography, ecological, earth observations sciences and data visualization, among others. We will briefly outline some of the most exciting, innovative and translational scientific advances that are currently being applied to these ecologically, environmentally and clinically important bacteria. © 2020 Crown copyright.Environmental Microbiology © 2020 Society for Applied Microbiology This article is published with the permission of the Controller of HMSO and the Queen's Printer for Scotland.",,"animal; climate change; genetics; genomics; human; pathogenicity; phylogeny; Vibrio; virulence; Animals; Climate Change; Genomics; Humans; Phylogeny; Vibrio; Virulence",Article,"",Scopus

Next-generation sequencing allows for thousands of genomic markers to be analyzed, which provides the resolution needed to address these questions in marine species with weakly differentiated populations. Greenland Halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) is one of the most important exploited demersal species throughout the North Atlantic, in particular in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada. There, two nurseries are known, the St. Lawrence Estuary and the northern Anticosti Island, but their contribution to the renewal of stocks remains unknown. The goals of this study were (a) to document the genetic structure and (b) to estimate the contribution of the different identified breeding stocks to nurseries. We sampled 100 juveniles per nursery and 50 adults from seven sites ranging from Saguenay Fjord to offshore Newfoundland, with some sites sampled over two consecutive years in order to evaluate the temporal stability of the contribution. Our results show that after removing sex-linked markers, the Estuary/Gulf of St. Lawrence represents a single stock which is genetically distinct from the Atlantic around Newfoundland (FST = 0.00146, p-value =.001). Population assignment showed that recruitment in both nurseries is predominantly associated with the St. Lawrence stock. However, we found that the relative contribution of both stocks to the nurseries is temporally variable with 1% contribution of the Newfoundland stock one year but up to 33% for the second year, which may be caused by year-to-year variation in larval transport into the Gulf of St. Lawrence. This study serves as a model for the identification of stocks for fisheries resources in a context where few barriers to dispersal occur, in addition to demonstrating the importance of considering sex-linked markers and temporal replicates in studies of population genomics. © 2020 The Authors.

Strains of this pathogen isolated from diseased European sea bass in aquaculture facilities in the Turkish coast of the Black Sea were found to exhibit reduced sensitivity to multiple antimicrobials. Selected representative strains were subjected to complete genome sequencing and plasmid characterization. It was found that multidrug resistant (MDR) isolates harboured large conjugative plasmids sharing part of their sequence backbone with pAQU-group plasmids, hitherto reported exclusively in China and Japan. Four new pAQU-group versions of plasmids were identified in the present study, containing distinct combinations of the resistance determinants tetB, floR, sul2, qnrVC, dfrA and strAB. Conjugative transfer of pPHDD2-OG2, a representative plasmid of 170,998 bp, occurred at high frequencies (2.2 × 10-2 transconjugants per donor cell), to E. coli and to pathogenic P. damselae subsp. damselae and subsp. piscicida strains. Upon transfer, pPHDD2-OG2 conferred reduced susceptibility to a number of antimicrobials to the recipient strains. Comparative genomics analysis of host strains suggested that these MDR plasmids of the pAQU-group were acquired by different genetic lineages of Pdd. This study provides evidence that P. damselae subsp. damselae isolated from diseased fish constitute a reservoir for conjugative MDR pAQU-group plasmids in the Mediterranean basin, and have the potential to spread to diverse bacterial species. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Acquired resistance; Aquaculture; MDR; pAQU; Photobacterium damselae; Plasmid","aquaculture; Black Sea; genetics; multidrug resistance; Photobacterium; plasmid; Aquaculture; Black Sea; Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial; Photobacterium; Plasmids",Article,"",Scopus

Results: In this study, we reported a high-quality and accurate de novo genome assembly of marine medaka through the integration of single-molecule sequencing, Illumina paired-end sequencing, and 10X Genomics linked-reads. The 844.17 Mb assembly is estimated to cover more than 98% of the genome and is more continuous with fewer gaps and errors than the previous genome assembly. Comparison of O. melastigma with closely related species showed significant expansion of gene families associated with DNA repair and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter pathways. We identified 274 genes that appear to be under significant positive selection and are involved in DNA repair, cellular transportation processes, conservation and stability of the genome. The positive selection of genes and the considerable expansion in gene numbers, especially related to stimulus responses provide strong supports for adaptations of O. melastigma under varying environmental stresses.

Therefore, it is imperative to characterise the main selective forces acting on ecosystems, and how these may influence the evolutionary potential of populations and species. Using a multi-model seascape genomics approach, we compare putative environmental drivers of selection in three sympatric southern African marine invertebrates with contrasting ecology and life histories: Cape urchin (Parechinus angulosus), Common shore crab (Cyclograpsus punctatus), and Granular limpet (Scutellastra granularis). Results: Using pooled (Pool-seq), restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq), and seven outlier detection methods, we characterise genomic variation between populations along a strong biogeographical gradient. Of the three species, only S. granularis showed significant isolation-by-distance, and isolation-by-environment driven by sea surface temperatures (SST). In contrast, sea surface salinity (SSS) and range in air temperature correlated more strongly with genomic variation in C. punctatus and P. angulosus. Differences were also found in genomic structuring between the three species, with outlier loci contributing to two clusters in the East and West Coasts for S. granularis and P. angulosus, but not for C. punctatus. Conclusion: The findings illustrate distinct evolutionary potential across species, suggesting that species-specific habitat requirements and responses to environmental stresses may be better predictors of evolutionary patterns than the strong environmental gradients within the region. We also found large discrepancies between outlier detection methodologies, and thus offer a novel multi-model approach to identifying the principal environmental selection forces acting on species. Overall, this work highlights how adding a comparative approach to seascape genomics (both with multiple models and species) can elucidate the intricate evolutionary responses of ecosystems to global change. © 2020 The Author(s).","Comparative phylogeography; Environmental association; Marine invertebrates; Pool-seq; RAD-seq; Seascape genomics","environmental conditions; genomics; identification method; marine environment; natural selection; sympatry; Carcinus maenas; Cyclograpsus; Invertebrata; Parechinus angulosus; Scutellastra granularis; animal; Brachyura; DNA sequence; ecosystem; gastropod; genetic selection; genetics; genomics; population genetics; sea urchin; single nucleotide polymorphism; temperature; Animals; Brachyura; Ecosystem; Gastropoda; Genetics, Population; Genomics; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Sea Urchins; Selection, Genetic; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Temperature",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

This is mediated by life-history traits such as the timing and frequency of spawning, larval behaviour and duration, and settlement success. Here, we use 1725 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to study the fine-scale spatial genetic structure in the commercially important cockle species Cerastoderma edule and compare it to environmental variables and current-mediated larval dispersal within a modelling framework. Hydrodynamic modelling employing the NEMO Atlantic Margin Model (AMM15) was used to simulate larval transport and estimate connectivity between populations during spawning months (April–September), factoring in larval duration and interannual variability of ocean currents. Results at neutral loci reveal the existence of three separate genetic clusters (mean FST = 0.021) within a relatively fine spatial scale in the north-west Atlantic. Environmental association analysis indicates that oceanographic currents and geographic proximity explain over 20% of the variance observed at neutral loci, while genetic variance (71%) at outlier loci was explained by sea surface temperature extremes. These results fill an important knowledge gap in the management of a commercially important and overexploited species, bringing us closer to understanding the role of larval dispersal in connecting populations at a fine geographic scale. © 2020 The Authors.

Over the last 20 years, three major coral bleaching events occurred in concomitance with anomalous heatwaves, provoking a severe loss of coral cover worldwide. The conservation strategies for preserving reefs, as they are implemented now, cannot cope with global climatic shifts. Consequently, researchers are advocating for preservation networks to be set-up to reinforce coral adaptive potential. However, the main obstacle to this implementation is that studies on coral adaption are usually hard to generalize at the scale of a reef system. Here, we study the relationships between genotype frequencies and environmental characteristics of the sea (seascape genomics), in combination with connectivity analysis, to investigate the adaptive potential of a flagship coral species of the Ryukyu Archipelago (Japan). By associating genotype frequencies with descriptors of historical environmental conditions, we discovered six genomic regions hosting polymorphisms that might promote resistance against heat stress. Remarkably, annotations of genes in these regions were consistent with molecular roles associated with heat responses. Furthermore, we combined information on genetic and spatial distances between reefs to predict connectivity at a regional scale. The combination of these results portrayed the adaptive potential of this population: we were able to identify reefs carrying potential heat stress adapted genotypes and to understand how they disperse to neighbouring reefs. This information was summarized by objective, quantifiable and mappable indices covering the whole region, which can be extremely useful for future prioritization of reefs in conservation planning. This framework is transferable to any coral species on any reef system and therefore represents a valuable tool for empowering preservation efforts dedicated to the protection of coral reefs in warming oceans. © 2020 The Authors.

Despite they have been historically used in a variety of research fields, ranging from genomics to ecology, their evolutionary origin and genetic structure remains elusive for most valid species. There are currently 19 valid species distributed in 5 subgenera, which can have restricted to cosmopolitan distribution patterns. However, their true biodiversity and biographical distribution are blurred by evidences of cryptic species within most of these valid species. Here, we inferred a 18S rDNA-based time-calibrated tree to determine the evolutionary origin of extant Paramecium lineages and intra-genus phylogenetic relationships. Next, we used two common computational species delimitation algorithms (PTP and mPTP) to analyze a population-level (cytochrome oxidase subunit I [COI]) phylogeny to predict the existence of independent evolutionary unities (IEUs) within valid Paramecium morphospecies. Our data suggest that, some cosmopolitan Paramecium may have emerged prior to the Cretaceous period (before the complete separation of the continents), thus, explaining their wide distribution pattern. We found that the diversity of cryptic species may be higher than previous though and that most of the valid Paramecium species should be, in fact considered as complexes of species, composed each by IEUs that can co-occur within restricted or wide geographical areas. Moreover, our data indicate that these species delimitation algorithms (PTP and mPTP) may be of great assistance to uncover the diversity of cryptic species within Paramecium (or any other microeukaryote) by indicating potential candidates for more in detail future studies of taxonomists through integrative taxonomy frameworks. © The Trustees of the Natural History Museum, London 2020.

Yet, little is known about the characteristics that drive their ubiquity in diverse ecological niches. Here, we provide an overview of functional traits common to taxonomically diverse members of the family Flavobacteriaceae from different environmental sources, with a focus on the Marine clade. We include seven newly sequenced marine sponge-derived strains that were also tested for gliding motility and antimicrobial activity. Results: Comparative genomics revealed that genome similarities appeared to be correlated to 16S rRNA gene- and genome-based phylogeny, while differences were mostly associated with nutrient acquisition, such as carbohydrate metabolism and gliding motility. The high frequency and diversity of genes encoding polymer-degrading enzymes, often arranged in polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs), support the capacity of marine Flavobacteriaceae to utilize diverse carbon sources. Homologs of gliding proteins were widespread among all studied Flavobacteriaceae in contrast to members of other phyla, highlighting the particular presence of this feature within the Bacteroidetes. Notably, not all bacteria predicted to glide formed spreading colonies. Genome mining uncovered a diverse secondary metabolite biosynthesis arsenal of Flavobacteriaceae with high prevalence of gene clusters encoding pathways for the production of antimicrobial, antioxidant and cytotoxic compounds. Antimicrobial activity tests showed, however, that the phenotype differed from the genome-derived predictions for the seven tested strains. Conclusions: Our study elucidates the functional repertoire of marine Flavobacteriaceae and highlights the need to combine genomic and experimental data while using the appropriate stimuli to unlock their uncharted metabolic potential. © 2020 The Author(s).","Comparative genomics; Flavobacteriaceae; Free-living; Host-associated; Marine","antiinfective agent; antioxidant; cytotoxic agent; polysaccharide; RNA 16S; bacterial DNA; RNA 16S; antimicrobial activity; Article; bacterial phenomena and functions; bacterial strain; Bacteroidetes; carbohydrate metabolism; carbon source; comparative genomics; controlled study; environmental factor; experimental study; Flavobacteriaceae; gene cluster; genetic code; gliding motility; nonhuman; phylogeny; prediction; prevalence; secondary metabolism; sponge (Porifera); animal; carbohydrate metabolism; DNA sequence; Flavobacteriaceae; genetics; genomics; Animals; Carbohydrate Metabolism; DNA, Bacterial; Flavobacteriaceae; Genomics; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, DNA",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

In light of this, it is important to understand neutral gene flow patterns as a measure of dispersal potential, but also adaptive genetic variation as a measure of evolutionary potential. In order to assess genetic variation and how this relates to environment in the honeycomb worm (Sabellaria alveolata (L.)), a reef-building polychaete that supports high biodiversity, we carried out RAD sequencing using individuals from along its complete latitudinal range. Patterns of neutral population genetic structure were compared to larval dispersal as predicted by ocean circulation modelling, and outlier analyses and genotype-environment association tests were used to attempt to identify loci under selection in relation to local temperature data. Results: We genotyped 482 filtered SNPs, from 68 individuals across nine sites, 27 of which were identified as outliers using BAYESCAN and ARLEQUIN. All outlier loci were potentially under balancing selection, despite previous evidence of local adaptation in the system. Limited gene flow was observed among reef-sites (FST = 0.28 ± 0.10), in line with the low dispersal potential identified by the larval dispersal models. The North Atlantic reef emerged as a distinct population and this was linked to high local larval retention and the effect of the North Atlantic Current on dispersal. Conclusions: As an isolated population, with limited potential for natural genetic or demographic augmentation from other reefs, the North Atlantic site warrants conservation attention in order to preserve not only this species, but above all the crucial functional ecological roles that are associated with their bioconstructions.

In this study, we first analyzed the population structure of green turtles in the North Pacific; four regions in Japan (the Yaeyama, Okinawa, Amami, and Ogasawara Islands), the Southeast Asia, Taiwan, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic Marshall Islands, and the Central or Eastern Pacific (C/E Pacific) using ≃1 ng of gDNA from green turtle field samples – including ones from dead carcasses – and multiplexed inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) genotyping by sequencing (MIG-seq). In addition, we explored whether the genome-wide SNP data narrowed down the natal origins of foraging turtles that were difficult to identify by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotype alone. The overall nesting population structure observed from genome-wide SNPs was consistent with results from mtDNA, and the population isolation of the C/E Pacific and Ogasawara Islands from the other North Pacific populations was highlighted. However, the population boundaries among the Northwestern Pacific, other than those of the Ogasawaras, were not clear. The uniqueness of the Ogasawara population in genome-wide SNP data enabled the identification of turtles that were more likely to have been born on the Ogasawara Islands. Our results show that genome-wide SNP data are more practical in identifying the natal origins of turtles that were difficult determine by the conventional mtDNA-basis mixed stock analysis.

Yet, little is known about its solitary, non-colonial cell stages or its distribution during the colder, low-productivity seasons. We examined the biogeography of Phaeocystis along a high-resolution (0.5-degree latitudinal interval) transect from the Antarctic ice-edge to the equator of the South Pacific, in the austral autumn-winter. Using high-throughput 18S rRNA gene sequences with single nucleotide variable (zero-radius) operational taxonomic units (zOTUs) allowed us to explore the possibility of strain-level variation. From water samples within the upper water column, we show the presence of an abundant Phaeocystis assemblage that persisted during the colder months, contributing up to 9% of the microbial eukaryote community at high latitudes. The biogeography of Phaeocystis was strongly shaped by oceanographic boundaries, most prominently the polar and subantarctic fronts. Marked changes in dominant Phaeocystis antarctica zOTUs between different frontal zones support the concept that ecotypes may exist within the Phaeocystis assemblage. Our findings also show that the Phaeocystis assemblage did not abide by the classical latitudinal diversity gradient of increasing richness from the poles to the tropics; richness peaked at 30°S and declined to a minimum at 5°S. Another surprise was that P. globosa and P. cordata, previously thought to be restricted to the northern hemisphere, were detected at moderate abundances within the Southern Ocean. Our results emphasize the importance of oceanographic processes in shaping the biogeography of Phaeocystis and highlights the importance of genomics-based exploration of Phaeocystis, which have found the assemblage to be more complex than previously understood. The high winter relative abundance of the Phaeocystis assemblage suggests it could be involved in more complex ecological interactions during the less productive seasons, which should be considered in future studies to better understand the ecological role and strategies of this keystone species. © Copyright © 2020 Sow, Trull and Bodrossy.","18S (SSU) rRNA gene; amplicon sequence variants; haptophytes; latitudinal diversity gradient; oceanographic fronts; Phaeocystis; Southern Ocean; winter distribution","chlorophyll a; dissolved oxygen; RNA 18S; sea water; Article; biodiversity; biogeochemical cycling; biogeographic region; bioinformatics; climate change; colony forming unit; DNA determination; DNA extraction; DNA isolation; gene sequence; genome analysis; Haptophyta; high throughput sequencing; latitude; marine environment; nonhuman; oceanography; Phaeocystis; phylogeny; physical chemistry; Pontederia cordata; salinity; sea surface temperature; sequence alignment; single nucleotide polymorphism; water analysis; water sampling",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Population genomics and ecological niche modelling offer complementary new tools for uncovering functional units of phylogenetic diversity. We hypothesize that phylogenetically delineated lineages of gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) distributed across Antarctica and sub-Antarctic Islands are subject to spatially explicit ecological conditions that have limited gene flow, facilitating genetic differentiation, and thereby speciation processes. Location: Antarctica and sub-Antarctic area. Methods: We identify divergent lineages for gentoo penguins using ddRAD-seq and mtDNA, and generated species distribution models (SDMs) based on terrestrial and marine parameters. Results: Analyses of our genomic data supports the existence of four major lineages of gentoo penguin: (i) spanning the sub-Antarctic archipelagos north of the Antarctic Polar Front (APF); (ii) Kerguelen Island; (iii) South America; and (iv) across maritime Antarctic and the Scotia Arc archipelagos. The APF, a major current system around Antarctica, acts as the most important barrier separating regional sister lineages. Our ecological analyses spanning both the terrestrial (breeding sites) and marine (feeding sites) realms recover limited niche overlap among the major lineages of gentoo penguin. We observe this pattern to correspond more closely with regional differentiation of marine conditions than to terrestrial macroenvironmental features. Main conclusions: Recognition of regional genetic lineages as discrete evolutionary entities that occupy distinct ecological niches and also differ morphologically should be considered a priority for conservation. Gentoo penguins provide a good example of how conservation policy can be directly impacted by new insights obtained through the integration of larger genomic datasets with novel approaches to ecological modelling.

The regulatory changes triggered by the temperature shift experienced by this marine pathogen upon entering the human body, are completely unknown. Here we report an RNA-seq approach combined with phenotypical assays to study the response of Pdd to cultivation at 37°C in comparison to 25°C. We found that cultivation of a Pdd highly virulent strain for fish and mice, RM-71, at 37°C, initially enhanced bacterial growth in comparison to 25°C as evidenced by the increase in optical density. However, cells were found to undergo a progressive loss of viability after 6 h cultivation at 37°C, and no viable cells could be detected from 30 h cultures at 37°C. In contrast, at 25°C, viable cell counts achieved the highest values at 30 h cultivation. Cells grown at 25°C showed normal rod morphology by scanning electron microscopy analysis whereas cells grown at 37°C exhibited chain-like structures and aberrant long shapes suggesting a defect in daughter cell separation and in septum formation. Cells grown at 37°C also exhibited reduced tolerance to benzylpenicillin. Using a RNA-seq approach we discovered that growth at 37°C triggered a heat-shock response, whereas genes involved in motility and virulence were repressed including iron acquisition systems, the type two secretion system, and damselysin toxin, a major virulence factor of Pdd. Human isolates did not exhibit advantage growing at 37°C compared to fish isolates, and comparative genomics did not reveal gene markers specific of human isolates, suggesting that any Pdd genotype existing in the marine environment might potentially cause disease in humans. Altogether, these data indicate that the potential of Pdd to cause disease in humans is an accidental condition rather than a selected trait, and that human body temperature constitutes a stressful condition for Pdd. This study provides the first transcriptome profile of Pdd exposed at human body temperature, and unveils a number of candidate molecular targets for prevention and control of human infections caused by this pathogen. © Copyright © 2020 Matanza and Osorio.","heat-shock response; hemolysin; Photobacterium damselae; temperature; transcriptome; zoonosis","2 isopropylmalate synthase; 3 isopropylmalate dehydratase large subunit; 3 isopropylmalate dehydratase small subunit; 3 isopropylmalate dehydrogenase; ABC transporter; ABC transporter periplasmic spermidine putrescine binding protein PotD; ABC transporter subfamily B; adenylosuccinate synthase; alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit C; alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit C like protein; ATP synthase alpha chain; ATP synthase gamma chain; beta galactosidase; carbon; chaperone; chaperone protein HtpG; chaperonin 60; chemotaxis protein CheV; cobalamin binding protein; cold shock protein; complementary DNA; damselysin; deoxyribonuclease I; deoxyribose phosphate aldolase; esterase; fatty acid ester; ferrichrome iron receptor; flagellar motor rotation protein MotA; flagellar motor rotation protein MotB; flagellin protein FlaB; flavohemoprotein; Flp pilus assembly protein TadD; gluthatione regulated potassium efflux system protein KefB; glycosaminoglycan; glyoxylate cycle isocitrate lyase; heat shock chaperonin; heat shock protein; heat shock protein A; heat shock protein GrpE; hexamethyldisilazane; histone acetyltransferase HPA2; homoserine kinase; hypothetical phage shock protein C; iron dicitrate transport system permease protein FecD; lipoprotein precursor OmpA family; lysozyme; mar binding filament like protein 1; membrane lipid; methionine sulfoxide reductase; multidrug efflux protein NorA; n acetylglucosamine regulated methyl accepting chemotaxis protein; NAD dependent glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; nitrogen; nucleoside permease NupC; oligopeptidase A; OmpL porin like protein L precursor; oxidoreductase; penicillin G; peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase MsrA; phage shock protein A; phage shock protein B; phobalysin C; phobalysin P; phosphate; phosphate transport regulator; Phosphatidylglycerophosphatase B; phosphopentomutase; protein ClpB; protein DnaK; proteinase K; proton; proton transporting adenosine triphosphate synthase; putative choline glycine betaine transporter; putative heat shock protein YegD; putrescine; racemase; saturated fatty acid; sodium ion; sodium thiosulfate; Sodium type flagellar protein MotY precursor; sodium type polar flagellar protein MotX; spermidine; sulfate permease; sulfate transporter CysZ; target of rapamycin complex subunit LST8; thiamine ABC transporter; thiamine biosynthesis ThiC; thiol disulfide isomerase; thioredoxin peroxidase; threonine synthase; thymidine phosphorylase; transcriptome; trimethylamine oxide; UDP 2 3 diacylglucosamine hydrolase; unclassified drug; unsaturated fatty acid; urease accessory protein UreA; urease accessory protein UreC; urease accessory protein UreE; urease accessory protein UreF; urease accessory protein UreG; virulence factor; algorithm; Article; bacterial growth; bacterial virulence; bacterium adherence; body temperature; cell count; cell separation; cell structure; cell viability; chromatography by stationary phase; colony forming unit; comparative genomics; controlled study; daughter cell; DNA modification; dynamics; evolutionary adaptation; gene expression; gene mutation; genetic similarity; genetic susceptibility; genotype phenotype correlation; growth curve; heat shock response; human; human cell; incubation temperature; membrane stabilization; necrotizing fasciitis; Neophocaena asiaeorientalis; opportunistic infection; Photobacterium damselae; phylogenetic tree; principal component analysis; receptor down regulation; regulatory mechanism; RNA sequencing; scanning electron microscopy; sequence alignment; spectrophotometry; stress; transposon; type II secretion system",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Used since prehistoric times, this is the best-known shell of Europe's cultural heritage. We find that Spondylus microstructure is very poor in mineral-bound organics, which are mostly intercrystalline and concentrated at the interface between structural layers. Using high-resolution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) we characterized several shell protein fractions, isolated following different bleaching treatments. Several peptides were identified as well as six shell proteins, which display features and domains typically found in biomineralized tissues, including the prevalence of intrinsically disordered regions. It is very likely that these sequences only partially represent the full proteome of Spondylus, considering the lack of genomics data for this genus and the fact that most of the reconstructed peptides do not match with any known shell proteins, representing consequently lineage-specific sequences. This work sheds light onto the shell matrix involved in the biomineralization in spondylids. Our proteomics data suggest that Spondylus has evolved a shell-forming toolkit, distinct from that of other better studied pectinoids – fine-tuned to produce shell structures with high mechanical properties, while limited in organic content. This study therefore represents an important milestone for future studies on biomineralized skeletons and provides the first reference dataset for forthcoming molecular studies of Spondylus archaeological artifacts. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Biomineralization; Evolution; Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; Proteomics; Shell biochemistry","lectin; peptide; proteome; sugar; mineral; proteome; animal shell; Article; biomineralization; bleaching; controlled study; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; genomics; in vitro study; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; molecular weight; nonhuman; oyster; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; prevalence; priority journal; protein analysis; proteomics; Spondylus gaederopus; animal; animal shell; bone mineralization; genetics; metabolism; oyster; physiology; ultrastructure; Animal Shells; Animals; Calcification, Physiologic; Minerals; Ostreidae; Proteome",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus

In natural or selected populations of P. yezoensis, coloration mutants are frequently observed. Various coloration mutants are excellent materials for genetic research and study photosynthesis. However, the candidate gene controlling the Pyropia coloration phenotype remains unclear to date. QTL-seq, in combination with kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) and RNA-seq, can be generally applied to population genomics studies to rapidly identify genes that are responsible for phenotypes showing extremely opposite traits. Through cross experiments between the wild line RZ and red-mutant HT, offsprings with 1–4 sectors chimeric blade were generated. Statistical analyses revealed that the red thallus coloration phenotype is conferred by a single nuclear allele. Two-pair populations, consisting of 24 and 56 wild-type/red-type single-genotype sectors from F1 progeny, were used in QTL-seq to detect a genomic region in P. yezoensis harboring the red coloration locus. Based on a high-quality genome, we first identified the candidate region within a 3.30-Mb region at the end of chromosome 1. Linkage map-based QTL analysis was used to confirm the candidate region identified by QTL-seq. Then, four KASP markers developed in this region were used to narrow down the candidate region to a 1.42-Mb region. Finally, we conducted RNA-seq to focus on 13 differentially expressed genes and further predicted rcl-1, which contains one non-synonymous SNP [A/C] in the coding region that could be regulating red thallus coloration in P. yezoensis. Our results provide novel insights into the underlying mechanism controlling blade coloration, which is a desirable trait in algae. © Copyright © 2020 Yu, Wang, Xu, Kong, Wang, Tang, Sun and Mao.","fine mapping; KASP; mutant; Pyropia yezoensis; QTL-seq; red coloration; RNA-seq",,Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Genome size may be different between the sexes within a species. However, little information on the genome size of both sexes is available, particularly in ulvophycean marine green algae, because few methods of genome size estimation are suitable for these algae. We developed a method to examine the genome sizes of males and females in the dioicous ulvophycean marine green alga Monostroma angicava. We examined three methods to isolate haploid nuclei: 1) chopping of a haploid gametophyte; 2) homogenization of protoplasts made from haploid gametophyte cells; and 3) homogenization of gametes and found homogenization of gametes to be the most suitable method for isolation of nuclei in M. angicava. Isolated nuclei were stained with propidium iodide. We measured the fluorescence intensity of nuclei using flow cytometry and successfully estimated the genome sizes of males and females as 178.8 Mbp and 185.4 Mbp, respectively, using Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica rapa as standard plants with an internal standard method. The genome size of males was slightly smaller than that of females. This may be due to the difference in the length of sex-specific genome regions. © 2020 Japan Mendel Society.

Recent studies have revealed that MGI Thaumarchaeota were present in the deepest part of oceans - the hadal zone (depth > 6000 m, consisting almost entirely of trenches), with the predominant phylotype being distinct from that in the ""shallower""deep sea. However, little is known about the metabolism and distribution of these ammonia oxidizers in the hadal water. Results: In this study, metagenomic data were obtained from 0-10,500 m deep seawater samples from the Mariana Trench. The distribution patterns of Thaumarchaeota derived from metagenomics and 16S rRNA gene sequencing were in line with that reported in previous studies: abundance of Thaumarchaeota peaked in bathypelagic zone (depth 1000-4000 m) and the predominant clade shifted in the hadal zone. Several metagenome-assembled thaumarchaeotal genomes were recovered, including a near-complete one representing the dominant hadal phylotype of MGI. Using comparative genomics, we predict that unexpected genes involved in bioenergetics, including two distinct ATP synthase genes (predicted to be coupled with H+ and Na+ respectively), and genes horizontally transferred from other extremophiles, such as those encoding putative di-myo-inositol-phosphate (DIP) synthases, might significantly contribute to the success of this hadal clade under the extreme condition. We also found that hadal MGI have the genetic potential to import a far higher range of organic compounds than their shallower water counterparts. Despite this trait, hadal MDI ammonia oxidation and carbon fixation genes are highly transcribed providing evidence they are likely autotrophic, contributing to the primary production in the aphotic deep sea. Conclusions: Our study reveals potentially novel adaptation mechanisms of deep-sea thaumarchaeotal clades and suggests key functions of deep-sea Thaumarchaeota in carbon and nitrogen cycling.

In corals, tissue concentrations of GB are substantially higher than in the ambient seawater. However, the synthetic routes remain unresolved, questioning whether intracellular GB originates from de novo synthesis or heterotrophic input. Here we show that the genomic blueprint of coral metaorganisms encode the biosynthetic and degradation machinery for GB. Member organisms also adopted the prokaryotic high-affinity carrier-mediated uptake of exogenous GB, rendering coral reefs potential sinks of marine dissolved GB. The machinery metabolizing GB is highly expressed in the coral model Aiptasia and its microalgal symbionts, signifying GB's role in the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis. We estimate that corals store between 106–109 grams of GB globally, representing about 16% of their nitrogen biomass.

These led to a large amount of industrial wastewater, which has been discharged into the ocean, resulting in marine pollution. Among them, heavy metals are considered to be one of the important pollutants in the environment due to their high risk and difficult to treat. After the concentration of heavy metals and other pollutants reaches a certain level in the marine environment, it will affect the normal growth and development of the organisms, thereby causing irreversible damage to the structure of biological populations and even the entire ecosystem. With the continuous development of system biology, it could be provide a more powerful tool to explore the ecotoxic effects of heavy metals on marine organisms and the response mechanism of organisms.

DNA in historical specimens is generally highly fragmented, complicating the recovery of high-grade genetic material. Furthermore, our understanding of hyperdiverse, wide-spread tree assemblages is obstructed by extensive species ranges, fragmented knowledge of tropical tree diversity and phenology, and a widespread lack of species-level diagnostic characters, prohibiting the collecting of readily identifiable specimens which can be used to build, revise or strengthen taxonomic frameworks. This, in turn, delays the application of downstream conservation action. A sizable component of botanical collections are sterile—thus eluding identification and are slowing down progress in systematic treatments of tropical biodiversity. With rapid advances in genomics and bioinformatic approaches to biodiversity research, museomics is emerging as a new field breathing life into natural collections that have been built up over centuries. Using MIGseq (multiplexed ISSR genotyping by sequencing), we generated 10,000s of short loci, for both freshly collected materials and museum specimens (aged >100 years) of Lithocarpus—a widespread tropical tree genus endemic to the Asian tropics. Loci recovery from historical and recently collected samples was not affected by sample age and preservation history of the study material, underscoring the reliability and flexibility of the MIGseq approach. Phylogenomic inference and biogeographic reconstruction across insular Asia, highlights repeated migration and diversification patterns between continental regions and islands. Results indicate that co-occurring insular species at the extremity of the distribution range are not monophyletic, raising the possibility of multiple independent dispersals along the outer edge of Wallacea. This suggests that dispersal of large seeded tree genera throughout Malesia and across Wallacea may have been less affected by large geographic distances and the presence of marine barriers than generally assumed. We demonstrate the utility of MIGseq in museomic studies using non-model taxa, presenting the first range-wide genomic assessment of Lithocarpus and tropical Fagaceae as a proof-of-concept.

Virus 37-F6 and relatives displayed diel cycling of transcriptional activities synchronized with its putative host. In both virus and host, the lowest transcription rates were observed at 14:00–15:00, coinciding roughly with maximum solar irradiance, while higher transcriptional rates were detected during the night/early morning and afternoon. Diel abundance of free viruses of 37-F6 in seawater roughly mirrored the transcriptional activities of both virus and host. In Osaka Bay, among viral relatives (genus level), virus 37-F6 specifically showed the highest ratio of transcriptional activity to virome abundance, a proxy for viral transcriptional activity relative to free viral particle abundance. This high ratio suggests high infection rate efficiencies in vSAG 37-F6 virus compared to viral relatives.

Work with E. scolopes has shown how the bacteria establish their niche in the light organ of the newly hatched host. Two types of V. fischeri strains have been distinguished based upon their behavior in cocolonization competition assays in juvenile E. scolopes, i.e., (i) niche-sharing or (ii) niche-dominant behavior. This study aimed to determine whether these behaviors are observed with other V. fischeri strains or whether they are specific to those isolated from E. scolopes light organs. Cocolonization competition assays between V. fischeri strains isolated from the congeneric squid E. morsei or from other marine animals revealed the same sharing or dominant behaviors. In addition, whole-genome sequencing of these strains showed that the dominant behavior is polyphyletic and not associated with the presence or absence of a single gene or genes. Comparative genomics of 44 squid light organ isolates from around the globe led to the identification of symbiosis-specific candidates in the genomes of these strains. Colonization assays using genetic derivatives with deletions of these candidates established the importance of two such genes in colonization. This study has allowed us to expand the concept of distinct colonization behaviors to strains isolated from a number of squid and fish hosts. IMPORTANCE There is an increasing recognition of the importance of strain differences in the ecology of a symbiotic bacterial species and, in particular, how these differences underlie crucial interactions with their host. Nevertheless, little is known about the genetic bases for these differences, how they manifest themselves in specific behaviors, and their distribution among symbionts of different host species. In this study, we sequenced the genomes of Vibrio fischeri isolated from the tissues of squids and fishes and applied comparative genomics approaches to look for patterns between symbiont lineages and host colonization behavior. In addition, we identified the only two genes that were exclusively present in all V. fischeri strains isolated from the light organs of sepiolid squid species. Mutational studies of these genes indicated that they both played a role in colonization of the squid light organ, emphasizing the value of applying a comparative genomics approach in the study of symbioses. © 2020 Bongrand et al.","Aliivibrio; Dominance; Genome analysis; Genomes; Intraspecific; Symbiosis; Vibrio (Aliivibrio) fischeri; Vibrio fischeri","Aliivibrio fischeri; article; comparative genomics; competition; controlled study; ecology; fish; gene deletion; genome analysis; human tissue; nonhuman; squid; strain difference; symbiont; whole genome sequencing; Aliivibrio fischeri; aliivibrio infection; animal; bacterial genome; classification; Decapodiformes; fish disease; genomics; host pathogen interaction; human; microbiology; phylogeny; phylogeography; physiology; procedures; symbiosis; veterinary medicine; virulence; Aliivibrio fischeri; Aliivibrio Infections; Animals; Decapodiformes; Fish Diseases; Genome, Bacterial; Genomics; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Phylogeny; Phylogeography; Symbiosis; Virulence",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Its browsing activity can deeply modify the littoral landscape, and changes in its abundance are of major conservation concern. This species is facing nowadays contrasting anthropogenic pressures linked to predator release, exploitation and sea warming. Management of this key species requires knowledge of its genetic structure, connectivity and local adaptation. Our goal was to assess the current global status of the species under a genomic perspective. Location: Atlanto-Mediterranean shores from Morocco and France to Turkey. Methods: We used genotyping by sequencing (GBS) of 241 individuals belonging to 11 populations spanning the known range of distribution of the species. We obtained 3,348 loci for population genomics and outlier analyses. Results: We identified significant genetic structure and a gradient matching the longitudinal position of the localities. A hierarchical analysis revealed two main clusters (Atlantic and Mediterranean) and subtler patterns of differentiation within them. Candidate markers for selection identified between and within these two main clusters were mostly different, likely indicating different selective pressures. Adaptation to maximum salinity and maximum temperature appeared as an important driver of the transition between Atlantic and Mediterranean basins. Other stressors, such as minimum temperature or range of temperature, seem to define the structuring within the Mediterranean. Main conclusions: Our study shows the potential of hierarchical analyses on population genomics to detect fine-scale genetic structure and adaptation signatures in marine species with long dispersal capabilities. Although genetic interchange occurs widely in Paracentrotus lividus, the species is sensitive to dispersal barriers, displays isolation by distance and faces local selective pressures associated to environmental conditions, all of which can render it more vulnerable than previously thought. © 2019 The Authors.

The combination of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) has the potential to enrich taxonomically well-defined clades for genomic analyses. Methods: Cells hybridized with a taxon-specific FISH probe are enriched based on their fluorescence signal via flow cytometric cell sorting. A recently developed FISH procedure, the hybridization chain reaction (HCR)-FISH, provides the high signal intensities required for flow cytometric sorting while maintaining the integrity of the cellular DNA for subsequent genome sequencing. Sorted cells are subjected to shotgun sequencing, resulting in targeted metagenomes of low diversity. Results: Pure cultures of different taxonomic groups were used to (1) adapt and optimize the HCR-FISH protocol and (2) assess the effects of various cell fixation methods on both the signal intensity for cell sorting and the quality of subsequent genome amplification and sequencing. Best results were obtained for ethanol-fixed cells in terms of both HCR-FISH signal intensity and genome assembly quality. Our newly developed pipeline was successfully applied to a marine plankton sample from the North Sea yielding good quality metagenome assembled genomes from a yet uncultivated flavobacterial clade. Conclusions: With the developed pipeline, targeted metagenomes at various taxonomic levels can be efficiently retrieved from environmental samples.

However, the genetic mechanisms underlying their abilities of distinguishing and defending against invading microbes are still unclear. Results: Here, we describe the 2.06 Gbp genome assembly of Tachypleus tridentatus with 24,222 predicted protein-coding genes. Comparative genomics shows that T. tridentatus and the Atlantic horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus have the most orthologues shared among two species, including genes involved in the immune-related JAK-STAT signalling pathway. Divergence time dating results show that the last common ancestor of Asian horseshoe crabs (including T. tridentatus and C. rotundicauda) and L. polyphemus appeared approximately 130 Mya (121-141), and the split of the two Asian horseshoe crabs was dated to approximately 63 Mya (57-69). Hox gene analysis suggests two clusters in both horseshoe crab assemblies. Surprisingly, selective analysis of immune-related gene families revealed the high expansion of conserved pattern recognition receptors. Genes involved in the IMD and JAK-STAT signal transduction pathways also exhibited a certain degree of expansion in both genomes. Intact coagulation cascade-related genes were present in the T. tridentatus genome with a higher number of coagulation factor genes. Moreover, most reported antibacterial peptides have been identified in T. tridentatus with their potentially effective antimicrobial sites. Conclusions: The draft genome of T. tridentatus would provide important evidence for further clarifying the taxonomy and evolutionary relationship of Chelicerata. The expansion of conserved immune signalling pathway genes, coagulation factors and intact antimicrobial peptides in T. tridentatus constitutes its robust and effective innate immunity for self-defence in marine environments with an enormous number of invading pathogens and may affect the quality of the adaptive properties with regard to complicated marine environments. © 2020 The Author(s).","Coagulation; Evolution; Genome; Innate immunity; Tachypleus tridentatus","blood clotting factor; Janus kinase; pattern recognition receptor; polypeptide antibiotic agent; STAT protein; DNA; peptide; animal tissue; Article; Asia; Carcinoscorpius; comparative genomics; controlled study; evolution; genetic analysis; genetic conservation; horseshoe crab; Hox gene; innate immunity; JAK-STAT signaling; Limulus polyphemus; marine environment; multigene family; nonhuman; phenotype; species comparison; Tachypleus tridentatus; animal; blood clotting; chemistry; classification; genetics; genome; homeobox; horseshoe crab; innate immunity; molecular evolution; nucleotide repeat; phylogeny; signal transduction; Animals; Blood Coagulation; DNA; Evolution, Molecular; Genes, Homeobox; Genome; Horseshoe Crabs; Immunity, Innate; Peptides; Phylogeny; Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid; Signal Transduction",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

This group of neurotoxins is produced by several species of freshwater cyanobacteria and marine dinoflagellates. The saxitoxin biosynthesis pathway was described for the first time in the 1980s and, since then, it was studied in more than seven cyanobacterial genera, comprising 26 genes that form a cluster ranging from 25.7 kb to 35 kb in sequence length. Due to the complexity of the genomic landscape, saxitoxin biosynthesis in dinoflagellates remains unknown. In order to reveal and understand the dynamics of the activity in such impressive unicellular organisms with a complex genome, a strategy that can carefully engage them in a systems view is necessary. Advances in omics technology (the collective tools of biological sciences) facilitated high-throughput studies of the genome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome of dinoflagellates. The omics approach was utilized to address saxitoxin-producing dinoflagellates in response to environmental stresses to improve understanding of dinoflagellates gene-environment interactions. Therefore, in this review, the progress in understanding dinoflagellate saxitoxin biosynthesis using an omics approach is emphasized.

While conventional modes of conservation have made strides in mitigating impacts of human activities on ocean ecosystems, those strategies alone cannot completely stem the tide of mounting threats. Biotechnology and genomic research should be harnessed and developed within conservation frameworks to foster the persistence of viable ocean ecosystems. This document distills the results of a targeted survey, the Ocean Genomics Horizon Scan, which assessed opportunities to bring novel genetic rescue tools to marine conservation. From this Horizon Scan, we have identified how novel approaches from synthetic biology and genomics can alleviate major marine threats. While ethical frameworks for biotechnological interventions are necessary for effective and responsible practice, here we primarily assessed technological and social factors directly affecting technical development and deployment of biotechnology interventions for marine conservation. Genetic insight can greatly enhance established conservation methods, but the severity of many threats may demand genomic intervention. While intervention is controversial, for many marine areas the cost of inaction is too high to allow controversy to be a barrier to conserving viable ecosystems. Here, we offer a set of recommendations for engagement and program development to deploy genetic rescue safely and responsibly. © 2020 by the authors.

These small fish occur in marine and freshwater habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere, and in numerous cases the smaller freshwater populations have been established ""de novo"" from marine colonists. Independently evolved freshwater populations exhibit similar phenotypes that have been shown to derive largely from the same standing genetic variants. Geographic isolation prevents direct migration between the freshwater populations, strongly suggesting that these shared locally adaptive alleles are transported through the marine population. However it is still largely unknown how gene flow, recombination, and selection jointly impact the standing variation that might fuel this adaptation. Here we use individual-based, spatially explicit simulations to determine the levels of gene flow that best match observed patterns of allele sharing among habitats in stickleback. We aim to better understand how gene flow and local adaptation in large metapopulations determine the speed of adaptation and re-use of standing genetic variation. In our simulations we find that repeated adaptation uses a shared set of alleles that are maintained at low frequency by migration-selection balance in oceanic populations. This process occurs over a realistic range of intermediate levels of gene flow that match previous empirical population genomic studies in stickleback. Examining these simulations more deeply reveals how lower levels of gene flow leads to slow, independent adaptation to different habitats, whereas higher levels of gene flow leads to significant mutation load - but an increased probability of successful population genomic scans for locally adapted alleles. Surprisingly, we find that the genealogical origins of most freshwater adapted alleles can be traced back to the original generation of marine individuals that colonized the lakes, as opposed to subsequent migrants. These simulations provide deeper context for existing studies of stickleback evolutionary genomics, and guidance for future empirical studies in this model. More broadly, our results support existing theory of local adaptation but extend it by more completely documenting the genealogical history of adaptive alleles in a metapopulation.

Although more than 50 genomes are available, a comprehensive comparative genomics study to resolve taxonomic inconsistencies is currently missing. We analyzed all available genomes and used 552 core genes to perform a robust phylogenomic reconstruction. This in-depth analysis revealed the divergence of two monophyletic basal lineages of strains isolated from polyclad flatworm hosts, namely, Pseudovibrio hongkongensis and Pseudovibrio stylochi. These strains have reduced genomes and lack sulfur-related metabolisms and major biosynthetic gene clusters, and their environmental distribution appears to be tightly associated with invertebrate hosts. We showed experimentally that the divergent strains are unable to utilize various sulfur compounds that, in contrast, can be utilized by the type strain Pseudovibrio denitrificans. Our analyses suggest that the lineage leading to these two strains has been subject to relaxed purifying selection resulting in great gene loss. Overall genome relatedness indices (OGRI) indicate substantial differences between the divergent strains and the rest of the genus. While 16S rRNA gene analyses do not support the establishment of a different genus for the divergent strains, their substantial genomic, phylogenomic, and physiological differences strongly suggest a divergent evolutionary trajectory and the need for their reclassification. Therefore, we propose the novel genus Polycladidibacter gen. nov. IMPORTANCE The genus Pseudovibrio is commonly associated with marine invertebrates, which are essential for ocean health and marine nutrient cycling. Traditionally, the phylogeny of the genus has been based on 16S rRNA gene analysis. The use of the 16S rRNA gene or any other single marker gene for robust phylogenetic placement has recently been questioned. We used a large set of marker genes from all available Pseudovibrio genomes for in-depth phylogenomic analyses. We identified divergent monophyletic basal lineages within the Pseudovibrio genus, including two strains isolated from polyclad flatworms. These strains showed reduced sulfur metabolism and biosynthesis capacities. The phylogenomic analyses revealed distinct evolutionary trajectories and ecological adaptations that differentiate the divergent strains from the other Pseudovibrio members and suggest that they fall into a novel genus.

In order to gain insight into their adaptive potential to future environmental changes, it is critical to use adequate molecular tools to delimit species and population boundaries and to assess their genetic connectivity. We developed a set of target capture probes to investigate genetic variation across their large-sized genome using a population genomics approach. Target capture is less limited by DNA amount and quality than other genome-reduced representation protocols, and has the potential for application on closely related species based on probes designed from one species. Results: We generated the first draft genome of a pteropod, Limacina bulimoides, resulting in a fragmented assembly of 2.9 Gbp. Using this assembly and a transcriptome as a reference, we designed a set of 2899 genome-wide target capture probes for L. bulimoides. The set of probes includes 2812 single copy nuclear targets, the 28S rDNA sequence, ten mitochondrial genes, 35 candidate biomineralisation genes, and 41 non-coding regions. The capture reaction performed with these probes was highly efficient with 97% of the targets recovered on the focal species. A total of 137,938 single nucleotide polymorphism markers were obtained from the captured sequences across a test panel of nine individuals. The probes set was also tested on four related species: L. trochiformis, L. lesueurii, L. helicina, and Heliconoides inflatus, showing an exponential decrease in capture efficiency with increased genetic distance from the focal species. Sixty-two targets were sufficiently conserved to be recovered consistently across all five species. Conclusion: The target capture protocol used in this study was effective in capturing genome-wide variation in the focal species L. bulimoides, suitable for population genomic analyses, while providing insights into conserved genomic regions in related species. The present study provides new genomic resources for pteropods and supports the use of target capture-based protocols to efficiently characterise genomic variation in small non-model organisms with large genomes. © 2020 The Author(s).","Exon capture; Genome; Marine zooplankton; Non-model organism; Targeted sequencing","28S ribosome DNA; DNA; ribosome DNA; transcriptome; unclassified drug; sea water; transcriptome; Article; biomineralization; controlled study; DNA sequence; genetic conservation; genetic distance; genetic variation; genome analysis; genome size; Heliconoides inflatus; Limacina; Limacina bulimoides; Limacina helicina; Limacina lesueurii; Limacina trochiformis; mitochondrial gene; molecular probe; nonhuman; population genetics; pteropod; single nucleotide polymorphism; species difference; target capture probe; transcriptomics; untranslated region; animal; chemistry; gastropod; genetics; genome; genomics; marine biology; metabolism; pH; phylogeny; sea; species difference; Animals; Gastropoda; Genome; Genomics; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Marine Biology; Oceans and Seas; Phylogeny; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Seawater; Species Specificity; Transcriptome",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

They also allow for more accurate predictions of how future environmental change might affect marine species. The Persian/Arabian Gulf is extreme in both temperature and salinity, whereas the adjacent Gulf of Oman has conditions more typical of tropical oceans. The sea urchin Echinometra sp. EZ inhabits both of these seas and plays a critical role in coral reef health as a grazer and bioeroder, but, to date, there have been no population genomic studies on this or any urchin species in this unique region. E sp. EZ's life history traits (e.g., large population sizes, large reproductive clutches, and long life spans), in theory, should homogenize populations unless nonneutral processes are occurring. Here, we generated a draft genome and a restriction site-associated DNA sequencing data set from seven populations along an environmental gradient across the Persian/ Arabian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. The estimated genome size of E. sp. EZ was 609 Mb and the heterozygosity was among the highest recorded for an echinoderm at 4.5%. We recovered 918 high-quality SNPs from 85 individuals which we then used in downstream analyses. Population structure analyses revealed a high degree of admixture between all sites, although there was population differentiation and significant pairwise FST values between the two seas. Preliminary results suggest migration is bidirectional between the seas and nine candidate loci were identified as being under putative natural selection, including one collagen gene. This study is the first to investigate the population genomics of a sea urchin from this extreme environmental gradient and is an important contribution to our understanding of the complex spatial patterns that drive genomic divergence. © The Author(s) 2020.

The latter is active against ma-rine and terrestrial bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical strains form-ing different biofilm types. Several amino acid sequences were obtained from the partially purified antibiofilm protein, named alterocin. The Pseudoalteromonas sp. 3J6 genome was sequenced, and a candidate alt gene was identified by comparing the genome-encoded proteins to the sequences from purified alterocin. Expressing the alt gene in another nonactive Pseudoalteromonas sp. strain, 3J3, demonstrated that it is responsible for the antibiofilm activity. Alterocin is a 139-residue protein that in-cludes a predicted 20-residue signal sequence, which would be cleaved off upon ex-port by the general secretion system. No sequence homology was found between alterocin and proteins of known functions. The alt gene is not part of an operon and adjacent genes do not seem related to alterocin production, immunity, or regu-lation, suggesting that these functions are not fulfilled by devoted proteins. During growth in liquid medium, the alt mRNA level peaked during the stationary phase. A single promoter was experimentally identified, and several inverted repeats could be binding sites for regulators. alt genes were found in about 30% of the Pseudoaltero-monas genomes and in only a few instances of other marine bacteria of the Hahella and Paraglaciecola genera. Comparative genomics yielded the hypothesis that alt gene losses occurred within the Pseudoalteromonas genus. Overall, alterocin is a novel kind of antibiofilm protein of ecological and biotechnological interest. Copyright © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.

Its distribution, abundance, and amenability to developmental perturbation make it a popular model for ecologists and developmental biologists. Here, we present a chromosomal-level genome assembly of L. variegatus generated from a combination of PacBio long reads, 10× Genomics sequencing, and HiC chromatin interaction sequencing. We show L. variegatus has 19 chromosomes with an assembly size of 870.4 Mb. The contiguity and completeness of this assembly are reflected by a scaffold length N50 of 45.5 Mb and BUSCO completeness score of 95.5%. Ab initio and transcript-informed gene modeling and annotation identified 27,232 genes with an average gene length of 12.6 kb, comprising an estimated 39.5% of the genome. Repetitive regions, on the other hand, make up 45.4% of the genome. Physical mapping of well-studied developmental genes onto each chromosome reveals nonrandom spatial distribution of distinct genes and gene families, which provides insight into how certain gene families may have evolved and are transcriptionally regulated in this species. Lastly, aligning RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data onto this assembly demonstrates the value of highly contiguous, complete genome assemblies for functional genomics analyses that is unattainable with fragmented, incomplete assemblies.

In comparison with synthetic drugs, they have abounding beneficial effects in bestowing protection against many diseases, including cancer. Cancer has been observed as a major threat in recent decades, and its prevalence is expected to increase over the next decades. Also, current treatment methods in cancer therapy such as radiation therapy and chemotherapy cause severe adverse side effects among the cancer population. Therefore, it is exigent to find a remedy without any side effects. Methods: In recent years, research has focused on obtaining naturally derived products to encounter this complication. The current pace of investigations, such as gene identification and advancement in combinatorial chemistry, leads to the aberrant access to a wide range of new synthetic drugs. In fact, natural products act as templates in structure predictions and synthesis of new compounds with enhanced biological activities. Results: Recent developments in genomics have established the importance of polymorphism, which implies that patients require different drugs for their treatment. This demands the discovery of a large number of drugs, but limited sources restrict the pharmaceutical industry to overcome these major obstacles. The use of natural products and their semisynthetic and synthetic analogues could alleviate these problems. However, the lack of standardization in terms of developing methods for evaluating the chemical composition, efficacy, isolation and international approval is still a major limitation in this field. In the past few years, several drug-approval authorities, including the FDA and WHO have allowed using these naturally derived compounds in humans. Conclusion: In this review, we described the use of some natural products from plant and marine sources in cancer treatment and shed some light on semi-synthetic and synthetic compounds derived from natural sources used in cancer therapy. © 2020, Bentham Science Publishers.

However, divergence can still occur despite gene flow if strong selection acts on populations occupying different ecological niches. Here, we examined the population genomics of an ectoparasitic snail, Coralliophila violacea (Kiener 1836), that specializes on Porites corals in the Indo-Pacific. Previous genetic analyses revealed two sympatric lineages associated with different coral hosts. In this study, we examined the mechanisms promoting and maintaining the snails’ adaptation to their coral hosts. Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from type II restriction site-associated DNA (2b-RAD) sequencing revealed two differentiated clusters of C. violacea that were largely concordant with coral host, consistent with previous genetic results. However, the presence of some admixed genotypes indicates gene flow from one lineage to the other. Combined, these results suggest that differentiation between host-associated lineages of C. violacea is occurring in the face of ongoing gene flow, requiring strong selection. Indeed, 2.7% of all SNP loci were outlier loci (73/2,718), indicative of divergence with gene flow, driven by adaptation of each C. violacea lineage to their specific coral hosts. © 2020 The Authors.

Despite the wide distribution of the marine benthic group E archaea (referred to as Hydrothermarchaeota) in the hydrothermal environment, little is known about their genomic repertoires and biogeochemical significance. Here, we studied four highly complete (&gt;80%) metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from a black smoker chimney and the surrounding sulfur-rich sediments on the South Atlantic Mid-Ocean Ridge and publicly available data sets (the Integrated Microbial Genomes system of the U.S. Department of Energy-Joint Genome Institute and NCBI SRA data sets). Genomic analysis suggested a wide carbon metabolic diversity of Hydrothermarchaeota members, including the utilization of proteins, lactate, and acetate; the anaerobic degradation of aromatics; the oxidation of C1 compounds (CO, formate, and formaldehyde); the utilization of methyl compounds; CO2 incorporation by the tetrahydromethanopterin-based Wood-Ljungdahl pathway; and participation in the type III ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase-based Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle. These microbes also potentially oxidize sulfur, arsenic, and hydrogen and engage in anaerobic respiration based on sulfate reduction and denitrification. Among the 140 MAGs reconstructed from the black smoker chimney microbial community (including Hydrothermarchaeota MAGs), community-level metabolic predictions suggested a redundancy of carbon utilization and element cycling functions and interactive syntrophic and sequential utilization of substrates. These processes might make various carbon and energy sources widely accessible to the microorganisms. Further, the analysis suggested that Hydrothermarchaeota members contained important functional components obtained from the community via lateral gene transfer, becoming a distinctive clade. This might serve as a niche-adaptive strategy for metabolizing heavy metals, C1 compounds, and reduced sulfur compounds. Collectively, the analysis provides comprehensive metabolic insights into the Hydrothermarchaeota. IMPORTANCE This study provides comprehensive metabolic insights into the Hydrothermarchaeota from comparative genomics, evolution, and community-level perspectives. Members of the Hydrothermarchaeota synergistically participate in a wide range of carbon-utilizing and element cycling processes with other microorganisms in the community. We expand the current understanding of community interactions within the hydrothermal sediment and chimney, suggesting that microbial interactions based on sequential substrate metabolism are essential to nutrient and element cycling.

Within this novel diversity, there are the uncultured MAST clades (MArine STramenopiles), which are major components of marine heterotrophic flagellates (HFs) thought to be active bacterial grazers. In this study, we investigated the gene expression of natural HFs in a mixed community where bacterivory was promoted. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization and 18S rDNA derived from metatranscriptomics, we followed the taxonomic dynamics during the incubation, and confirmed the increase in relative abundance of different MAST lineages. We then used single cell genomes of several MAST species to gain an insight into their most expressed genes, with a particular focus on genes related to phagocytosis. The genomes of MAST-4A and MAST-4B were the most represented in the metatranscriptomes, and we identified highly expressed genes of these two species involved in motility and cytoskeleton remodeling, as well as many lysosomal enzymes. Particularly relevant were the cathepsins, which are characteristic digestive enzymes of the phagolysosome and the rhodopsins, perhaps used for vacuole acidification.

However, the pathways of MMHg production and bioaccumulation in the ocean remain elusive. In anaerobic environments, inorganic mercury (Hg) can be methylated to MMHg through an enzymatic pathway involving the hgcAB gene cluster. Recently, hgcA-like genes have been discovered in oxygenated marine water, suggesting the hgcAB methylation pathway, or a close analog, may also be relevant in the ocean. Using polymerase chain reaction amplification and shotgun metagenomics, we searched for but did not find the hgcAB gene cluster in Arctic Ocean seawater. However, we detected Hg-cycling genes from the mer operon (including organomercury lyase, merB), and hgcA-like paralogs (i.e., cdhD) in Arctic Ocean metagenomes. Our analysis of Hg biogeochemistry and marine microbial genomics suggests that various microorganisms and metabolisms, and not just the hgcAB pathway, are important for Hg methylation in the ocean. © 2019 Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography",,"bioaccumulation; biogeochemistry; genomics; metabolism; methylation; polymerase chain reaction; speciation (chemistry); toxin; Arctic Ocean; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Equatorial); Mammalia",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus

Parallel divergence often occurs in heterogeneous environments with different kinds of environmental gradients in different locations, but the genomic basis underlying this process is unknown. We investigated the genomics of rapid parallel adaptation in the marine snail Littorina saxatilis in response to two independent environmental axes (crab-predation versus wave-action and low-shore versus high-shore). Using pooled whole-genome resequencing, we show that sharing of genomic regions of high differentiation between environments is generally low but increases at smaller spatial scales. We identify different shared genomic regions of divergence for each environmental axis and show that most of these regions overlap with candidate chromosomal inversions. Several inversion regions are divergent and polymorphic across many localities. We argue that chromosomal inversions could store shared variation that fuels rapid parallel adaptation to heterogeneous environments, possibly as balanced polymorphism shared by adaptive gene flow.

It is characterized by internal fertilization, long-term sperm storage in the female ovary, and a high abortion rate. For better understanding the mechanism of fertilization and gestation, it is essential to establish a reference genome for viviparous teleosts. Herein, we used a combination of Pacific Biosciences sequel, Illumina sequencing platforms, 10* Genomics, and Hi-C technology to obtain a genome assembly size of 848.31 Mb comprising 24 chromosomes, and contig and scaffold N50 lengths of 2.96 and 35.63 Mb, respectively. We predicted 39.98% repetitive elements, and 26,979 protein-coding genes. S. schlegelii diverged from Gasterosteus aculeatus -32.1-56.8 million years ago. Furthermore, sperm remained viable within the ovary for up to 6 months. The glucose transporter SLC2 showed significantly positive genomic selection, and carbohydrate metabolism-related KEGG pathways were significantly up-regulated in ovaries after copulation. In vitro suppression of glycolysis with sodium iodoacetate reduced sperm longevity significantly. The results indicated the importance of carbohydrates in maintaining sperm survivability. Decoding the S. schlegelii genome not only provides new insights into sperm storage; additionally, it is highly valuable for marine researchers and reproduction biologists. © The Author(s) 2019.

Genome-specific analysis and metabolic pathway comparison of the members of the genus Endozoicomonas revealed the presence of gene clusters encoding for unique metabolic features, such as the utilization of carbon sources through lactate, L-rhamnose metabolism, and a phenylacetic acid degradation pathway in Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23. Moreover, the genome harbors genes encoding for eukaryotic-like proteins, such as ankyrin repeats, tetratricopeptide repeats, and Sel1 repeats, which likely facilitate sponge-bacterium attachment.

Overall this review provides data from 66 species belonging to 39 families, collected from 80 published studies on both WoS (Web of Science) and Scopus databases. We found that studies on alien fishes focused on specific geographic areas, mainly the Mediterranean region. Furthermore, most studies restricted their approach to describe patterns of cryptic diversity and/or the development of novel markers, whilst the genetic structure of introduced populations and the genetic mechanisms driving the invasion processes were mostly neglected. The majority of studies on marine fishes reveal similar genetic diversity levels in both native and introduced ranges, suggesting massive or multiple introductions. Indeed, cases of introduced populations showing evidence of bottlenecks were rare. Genetic arrangements are not explained by taxonomic group or reproductive strategy but recent studies reveal rapid evolutionary changes associated with invasive lineages, opening new grounds to investigate mechanisms of adaptation in the natural environment. Finally, the potential of marine fish invasions as a model to test evolutionary responses to rapid environmental changes is further discussed.

The uncultured Pelagibacter virus vSAG 37-F6 discovered via single-virus genomics is one of the most abundant and cosmopolitan marine viruses; however, little is understood about its temporal variation. Here, we estimated the absolute number of infecting 37-F6 viruses in coastal bacterioplankton from the Mediterranean Sea by using a novel, feasible SYBR Green I chip-based digital PCR (SYBR dPCR) technique, not implemented before for enumerating (uncultured) microbes. Quantitative SYBR dPCR estimated 450–3480 genome copies of virus 37-F6 in cells/mL (i.e. infecting viruses) and a total of ≈10–400 putative infected cells/mL with a potential C release of 0.12–4.9 pg/ml in the analysed samples. Considering that virus 37-F6 is ubiquitous and abundant in all Tara samples, an enormous amount of C could be transformed by this virus through the ‘viral shunt’. Thus, this SYBR dPCR technique has enabled the absolute quantification of an ecologically relevant uncultured virus in nature and the estimation of its potential contribution on biogeochemical cycles. Overall, our study also shows that this approach has a broad applicability for quantifying any other target loci in Microbiology and Virology. © 2019 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"sea water; Alphaproteobacteria; bacteriophage; genetics; isolation and purification; Mediterranean Sea; polymerase chain reaction; procedures; virion; virology; virus load; Alphaproteobacteria; Bacteriophages; Mediterranean Sea; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Seawater; Viral Load; Virion",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

This has led to two pertinent questions: (i) do all Hilsa shad that migrate from marine to freshwater rivers come from the same population? and (ii) is there any relationship between adults and juveniles of a particular habitat? To address these questions, NextRAD sequencing was applied to genotype 31,276 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci for 180 individuals collected from six strategic locations of riverine, estuarine and marine habitats. FST OutFLANK approach identified 14,815 SNP loci as putatively neutral and 79 SNP loci as putatively adaptive. We observed that divergent local adaptations in differing environmental habitats have divided Hilsa shad into three genetically structured ecotypes: turbid freshwater (Western Riverine), clear freshwater (Eastern Riverine) and brackish-saline (Southern Estuarine-Marine). Our results also revealed that genes involved in neuronal activity may have facilitated the juveniles’ Hilsa shad in returning to their respective natal rivers for spawning.

Temperature is the main factor that controls the distribution and growth of seagrass around the world, yet how seagrass responds to heat stress remains poorly understood due to the lack of genomic and transcriptomic data. In this study, we applied a combination of second- and third-generation sequencing technologies to sequence full-length transcriptomes of Z. japonica. In total, we obtained 58,134 uniform transcripts, which included 46,070 high-quality full-length transcript sequences. We identified 15,411 simple sequence repeats, 258 long non-coding RNAs and 28,038 open reading frames.

Overall, our study provides the first large-scale full-length trascriptome in Zostera japonica, allowing for structural, functional and comparative genomics studies in this important seagrass species. Although previous studies have focused specifically on heat shock proteins, we found that examination of other heat stress related genes is important for studying response to heat stress in seagrass.

PacBio sequencing technology provides a powerful way to obtain high-quality completed genomes. However individual library production is currently still costly, limiting the utility of the PacBio system for high-throughput genomics. Here we investigate how to generate high-quality genomes from pooled marine bacterial genomes. Results: Pooled genomic DNA from 10 marine bacteria were subjected to a single library production and sequenced with eight SMRT cells on the PacBio RS II sequencing platform. In total, 7.35 Gbp of long-read data was generated, which is equivalent to an approximate 168× average coverage for the input genomes. Genome assembly showed that eight genomes with average nucleotide identities (ANI) lower than 91.4% can be assembled with high-quality and completion using standard assembly algorithms (e.g. HGAP or Canu). A reference-based reads phasing step was developed and incorporated to assemble the complete genomes of the remaining two marine bacteria that had an ANI > 97% and whose initial assemblies were highly fragmented.

In particular, reduced representation sequencing has facilitated the generation of dense genetic marker datasets that provide greater power for resolving population structure, investigating the role of selection and reconstructing demographic histories. We therefore used RAD sequencing to study the great scallop Pecten maximus and its sister species P. jacobeus along a latitudinal cline in Europe. Analysis of 219 samples genotyped at 82,439 single nucleotide polymorphisms clearly resolved an Atlantic and a Norwegian group within P. maximus as well as P. jacobeus, in support of previous studies. Fine-scale structure was also detected, including pronounced differences involving Mulroy Bay in Ireland, where scallops are commercially cultured. Furthermore, we identified a suite of 279 environmentally associated loci that resolved a contrasting phylogenetic pattern to the remaining neutral loci, consistent with ecologically mediated divergence. Finally, demographic inference provided support for the two P. maximus groups having diverged during the last glacial maximum and subsequently expanded, whereas P. jacobeus diverged around 95,000 generations ago and experienced less pronounced expansion.

Molecular sequencing methods are being used to describe this diversity and reveal new associations and metabolisms that are important to how these ecosystems function. We describe here the use of the single cell genomics approach to sample and interrogate the diversity of the smaller (pico- and nano-sized) protists from a range of oceanic samples. We created over 900 single amplified genomes (SAGs) from 8 Tara Ocean samples across the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. We show that flow cytometric sorting of single cells effectively distinguishes plastidic and aplastidic cell types that agree with our understanding of protist phylogeny. Yields of genomic DNA with PCR-identifiable 18S rRNA gene sequence from single cells was low (15% of aplastidic cell sorts, and 7% of plastidic sorts) and tests with alternate primers and comparisons to metabarcoding did not reveal phylogenetic bias in the major protist groups. There was little evidence of significant bias against or in favor of any phylogenetic group expected or known to be present. The four open ocean stations in the Indian Ocean had similar communities, despite ranging from 14°N to 20°S latitude, and they differed from the Mediterranean station. Single cell genomics of protists suggests that the taxonomic diversity of the dominant taxa found in only several hundreds of microliters of surface seawater is similar to that found in molecular surveys where liters of sample are filtered. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"DNA; RNA 18S; biodiversity; ecosystem; eukaryote; genetics; genomics; Indian Ocean; Mediterranean Sea; phylogeny; plankton; procedures; single cell analysis; Biodiversity; DNA; Ecosystem; Eukaryota; Genomics; Indian Ocean; Mediterranean Sea; Phylogeny; Plankton; RNA, Ribosomal, 18S; Single-Cell Analysis",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Contrary to the previous reports, the bloom of Pseudomonadales (specifically genus Acinetobacter) in oiled sediment and Methylococcales in oiled water outnumbered the relative abundance of Alcanivorax in response to hydrocarbon contamination. Overall enhancement of xenobiotic degradation was suggested by metabolomic analysis in sediment and water post the spill event and varying quantitative assemblage of enzymes were found to be involved in hydrocarbon utilization. Laboratory enrichments revealed the competitive advantage of sediment communities over the water communities although unique taxa belonging to the later were also found to be enriched under in vitro conditions.

Although they are sister groups, kinetoplastids and diplonemids have very distinct mitochondrial genome architectures, requiring widespread insertion/deletion RNA editing and extensive trans-splicing, respectively, in order to generate functional transcripts. The evolutionary history by which these differing processes arose remains unclear. Using single-cell genomics, followed by small sub unit ribosomal DNA and multigene phylogenies, we identified an isolated marine cell that branches on phylogenetic trees as a sister to known kinetoplastids. Analysis of singlecell amplified genomic material identified multiple mitochondrial genome contigs. These revealed a gene architecture resembling that of diplonemid mitochondria, with small fragments of genes encoded out of order and or on different contigs, indicating that these genes require extensive trans-splicing. Conversely, no requirement for kinetoplastid-like insertion/deletion RNA-editing was detected. Additionally, while we identified some proteins so far only found in kinetoplastids, we could not unequivocally identify mitochondrial RNA editing proteins. These data invite the hypothesis that extensive genome fragmentation and trans-splicing were the ancestral states for the kinetoplastid-diplonemid clade but were lost during the kinetoplastid radiation.

By contrast, the fragmentary knowledge on the biology of algae, the hope to find in this biodiversity inspiration for biotechnologies, and the emergency created by the environmental crisis affecting oceans, lakes, rivers, or melting glaciers, have stressed the importance to make up for lost time. Needed efforts embrace a broad spectrum of disciplines, from environmental and evolutionary sciences, to molecular and cell biology.

While extracellular metabolites are commonly measured in terrestrial and limnic ecosystems, the presence of salt in marine habitats limits the nontargeted analyses of the ocean exometabolome using mass spectrometry (MS). Current methods require salt removal prior to sample measurements, which can alter the molecular composition of the metabolome and limit the types of compounds detected by MS. To overcome these limitations, we developed a gas chromatography MS (GC-MS) method that avoids sample altering during salt removal and that detects metabolites down to nanomolar concentrations from less than 1 ml of seawater. We applied our method (SeaMet) to explore marine metabolomes in vitro and in vivo. First, we measured the production and consumption of metabolites during the culture of a heterotrophic bacterium, Marinobacter adhaerens. Our approach revealed successional uptake of amino acids, while sugars were not consumed. These results show that exocellular metabolomics provides insights into nutrient uptake and energy conservation in marine microorganisms. We also applied SeaMet to explore the in situ metabolome of coral reef and mangrove sediment porewaters. Despite the fact that these ecosystems occur in nutrient-poor waters, we uncovered high concentrations of sugars and fatty acids, compounds predicted to play a key role for the abundant and diverse microbial communities in coral reef and mangrove sediments. Our data demonstrate that SeaMet advances marine metabolomics by enabling a nontargeted and quantitative analysis of marine metabolites, thus providing new insights into nutrient cycles in the oceans. IMPORTANCE Nontargeted approaches using metabolomics to analyze metabolites that occur in the oceans is less developed than those for terrestrial and limnic ecosystems. One of the challenges in marine metabolomics is that salt limits metabolite analysis in seawater to methods requiring salt removal. Building on previous sample preparation methods for metabolomics, we developed SeaMet, which overcomes the limitations of salt on metabolite detection. Considering that the oceans contain the largest dissolved organic matter pool on Earth, describing the marine metabolome using nontargeted approaches is critical for understanding the drivers behind element cycles, biotic interactions, ecosystem function, and atmospheric CO2 storage. Our method complements both targeted marine metabolomic investigations as well as other “omics” (e.g., genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics) approaches by providing an avenue for studying the chemical interaction between marine microbes and their habitats. © 2019 Sogin et al.","Exometabolomics; Marine; Metabolomics; Microbial ecology","amino acid; carbohydrate; sea water; Article; coral reef; energy conservation; in vitro study; in vivo study; mangrove; marine bacterium; marine environment; Marinobacter; Marinobacter adhaerens; mass fragmentography; metabolome; metabolomics; microbial community; nonhuman; nutrient uptake; predictive value; quantitative analysis; sediment",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Expression of the master competence regulator TfoX bypasses the need for chitin induction and drives expression of the genes required for competence in several Vibrio species. Here, we show that TfoX expression in Vibrio campbellii strains DS40M4 and NBRC 15631 enables high natural transformation frequencies. Conversely, transformation was not achieved in the model quorum-sensing strain V. campbellii BB120 (previously classified as Vibrio harveyi). Surprisingly, we find that quorum sensing is not required for transformation in V. campbellii DS40M4 or Vibrio parahaemolyticus in contrast to the established regulatory pathway in Vibrio cholerae in which quorum sensing is required to activate the competence regulator QstR. Similar to V. cholerae, expression of both QstR and TfoX is necessary for transformation in DS40M4. There is a wide disparity in transformation frequencies among even closely related Vibrio strains, with V. vulnificus having the lowest functional transformation frequency. Ectopic expression of both TfoX and QstR is sufficient to produce a significant increase in transformation frequency in Vibrio vulnificus. To explore differences in competence regulation, we used previously studied V. cholerae competence genes to inform a comparative genomics analysis coupled with transcriptomics. We find that transformation capability cannot necessarily be predicted by the level of gene conservation but rather correlates with competence gene expression following TfoX induction. Thus, we have uncovered notable species-and strain-level variations in the competence gene regulation pathway across the Vibrio genus. IMPORTANCE Naturally transformable, or competent, bacteria are able to take up DNA from their environment, a key method of horizontal gene transfer for acquisition of new DNA sequences. Our research shows that Vibrio species that inhabit marine environments exhibit a wide diversity in natural transformation capability ranging from nontransformability to high transformation rates in which 10% of cells measurably incorporate new DNA. We show that the role of regulatory systems controlling the expression of competence genes (e.g., quorum sensing) differs throughout both the species and strain levels. We explore natural transformation capabilities of Vibrio campbellii species which have been thus far uncharacterized and find novel regulation of competence. Expression of two key transcription factors, TfoX and QstR, is necessary to stimulate high levels of transformation in Vibrio campbellii and recover low rates of transformation in Vibrio vulnificus. © 2019 Simpson et al.","Competence; Natural transformation; Quorum sensing; Vibrio","Article; bacterial gene; bacterial strain; bacterium transformation; controlled study; gene expression; gene locus; genetic conservation; genomics; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; QstR gene; quorum sensing; species diversity; TfoX gene; transcriptomics; Vibrio; Vibrio campbellii; Vibrio cholerae; Vibrio parahaemolyticus; Vibrio vulnificus; wild type; biological model; classification; gene expression regulation; genetic transformation; genetics; human; phylogeny; physiology; Vibrio; bacterial DNA; bacterial protein; transactivator protein; Bacterial Proteins; DNA Transformation Competence; DNA, Bacterial; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Humans; Models, Biological; Phenotype; Phylogeny; Quorum Sensing; Trans-Activators; Transformation, Bacterial; Vibrio",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Using recent advances in marine genomics, we explore new applications of oceanic metagenomes for protein structure and function prediction. Results: By processing 1.3 TB of high-quality reads from the Tara Oceans data, we obtain 97 million non-redundant genes. Of the 5721 Pfam families that lack experimental structures, 2801 have at least one member associated with the oceanic metagenomics dataset. We apply C-QUARK, a deep-learning contact-guided ab initio structure prediction pipeline, to model 27 families, where 20 are predicted to have a reliable fold with estimated template modeling score (TM-score) at least 0.5. Detailed analyses reveal that the abundance of microbial genera in the ocean is highly correlated to the frequency of occurrence in the modeled Pfam families, suggesting the significant role of the Tara Oceans genomes in the contact-map prediction and subsequent ab initio folding simulations. Of interesting note, PF15461, which has a majority of members coming from ocean-related bacteria, is identified as an important photosynthetic protein by structure-based function annotations. The pipeline is extended to a set of 417 Pfam families, built on the combination of Tara with other metagenomics datasets, which results in 235 families with an estimated TM-score over 0.5.

These can be coherently organized into three major functional clusters, each presenting distinct natural product biosynthesis profiles suggesting that evolutionary trajectories strongly underpin their secondary metabolite repertoire and presumed bioactivities. Aquimarina spp. are highly versatile bacteria equipped to colonize HA and FL microniches, eventually displaying opportunistic behaviour, owing to their shared ability to produce multiple glycoside hydrolases from diverse families. We furthermore uncover previously underestimated, and highly complex secondary metabolism for the genus by detecting 928 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) across all genomes, grouped in 439 BGC families, with polyketide synthases (PKSs), terpene synthases and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) ranking as the most frequent BGCs encoding drug-like candidates.

This key phylogenetic position has raised recently a great interest in the study of their constitutive clades, since they can provide us with character states that illuminate different aspects of the origin of bilateral animals. Moreover, the recent availability of genomic and transcriptomic data from different species has been used in inferring the internal relationships among xenacoelomorph clades and the deciphering of molecular mechanisms that contribute to the evolution of metazoan genomes.

Thousands of natural products have been isolated and characterized from sponges, and although relatively few of these compounds have been studied for their ecological functions, some are known to serve as chemical defenses against predators, microorganisms, fouling organisms, and other competitors. Sponges are hosts to an exceptional diversity of microorganisms, with almost 40 microbial phyla found in these associations to date. Microbial community composition and abundance are highly variable across host taxa, with a continuum from diverse assemblages of many microbial taxa to those that are dominated by a single microbial group. Microbial communities expand the nutritional repertoire of their hosts by providing access to inorganic and dissolved sources of nutrients. Not only does this continuum of microorganism-sponge associations lead to divergent nutritional characteristics in sponges, these associated microorganisms and symbionts have long been suspected, and are now known, to biosynthesize some of the natural products found in sponges. Modern ""omics"" tools provide ways to study these sponge-microbe associations that would have been difficult even a decade ago. Metabolomics facilitate comparisons of sponge compounds produced within and among taxa, and metagenomics and metatranscriptomics provide tools to understand the biology of host-microbe associations and the biosynthesis of ecologically relevant natural products. These combinations of ecological, microbiological, metabolomic and genomics tools, and techniques provide unprecedented opportunities to advance sponge biology and chemical ecology across many marine ecosystems. © 2019 The Author(s).",,"transcriptome; animal; aquatic species; genetics; genome; microbiology; microflora; physiology; sponge (Porifera); Animals; Aquatic Organisms; Genome; Host Microbial Interactions; Microbiota; Porifera; Transcriptome",Conference Paper,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus

Among them, seafood fraud has probably the strongest relationship with food safety, an activity that goes beyond economic interests. This article explores the capabilities of an innovative instrumental setup, called the “iKnife,” as a powerful tool in this specific research area, where until now genomics and proteomics have been the workhorses in analytical approaches. iKnife, which means “intelligent knife,” is the name of a recent technology based on rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry (REIMS). REIMS is an emerging technique able to characterize different samples rapidly, affording a comprehensive profile usable as a fingerprint, without the need for preliminary extraction or cleanup procedures. In detail, a REIMS source is coupled to a high-resolution tandem mass spectrometer; such coupling allows one to maximize the amount of information (discriminant features) collected for a single analysis, as well as to focus on target analytes to achieve enhanced sensitivity and selectivity. A database was created from 18 marine species typical of the Mediterranean Sea, all caught in the very small area of the Strait of Messina, and reliable identification was achieved for each species with confidence higher than 99%. One big model and three submodels were built by principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis for unambiguous key variable identification within each class (e.g., Cephalopoda), order (e.g., Perciformes), or family (e.g., Carangidae).

They occur worldwide in the surface of aquatic sediments, where they connect sulfide oxidation with oxygen or nitrate reduction via long-distance electron transport. In the absence of pure cultures, we used single-filament genomics and metagenomics to retrieve draft genomes of 3 marine Candidatus Electrothrix and 1 freshwater Ca. Electronema species. These genomes contain &gt;50% unknown genes but still share their core genomic makeup with sulfate-reducing and sulfur-disproportionating Desulfobulbaceae, with few core genes lost and 212 unique genes (from 197 gene families) conserved among cable bacteria. Last common ancestor analysis indicates gene divergence and lateral gene transfer as equally important origins of these unique genes. With support from metaproteomics of a Ca. Electronema enrichment, the genomes suggest that cable bacteria oxidize sulfide by reversing the canonical sulfate reduction pathway and fix CO2 using the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway. Cable bacteria show limited organotrophic potential, may assimilate smaller organic acids and alcohols, fix N2, and synthesize polyphosphates and polyglucose as storage compounds; several of these traits were confirmed by cell-level experimental analyses. We propose a model for electron flow from sulfide to oxygen that involves periplasmic cytochromes, yet-unidentified conductive periplasmic fibers, and periplasmic oxygen reduction. This model proposes that an active cable bacterium gains energy in the anodic, sulfide-oxidizing cells, whereas cells in the oxic zone flare off electrons through intense cathodic oxygen respiration without energy conservation; this peculiar form of multicellularity seems unparalleled in the microbial world. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

Specific interest is shown towards those metabolites that exhibit antimicrobial activities against multidrug-resistant bacteria that have become a global health threat. Genera of the phylum Firmicutes are frequently identified as sources of such metabolites, but the biosynthetic potential of its Virgibacillus genus is not known. Here, we used comparative genomic analysis to determine whether Virgibacillus strains isolated from the Red Sea mangrove mud in Rabigh Harbor Lagoon, Saudi Arabia, may be an attractive source of such novel antimicrobial agents. Results: A comparative genomics analysis based on Virgibacillus dokdonensis Bac330, Virgibacillus sp. Bac332 and Virgibacillus halodenitrificans Bac324 (isolated from the Red Sea) and six other previously reported Virgibacillus strains was performed. Orthology analysis was used to determine the core genomes as well as the accessory genome of the nine Virgibacillus strains. The analysis shows that the Red Sea strain Virgibacillus sp. Bac332 has the highest number of unique genes and genomic islands compared to other genomes included in this study. Focusing on biosynthetic gene clusters, we show how marine isolates, including those from the Red Sea, are more enriched with nonribosomal peptides compared to the other Virgibacillus species. We also found that most nonribosomal peptide synthases identified in the Virgibacillus strains are part of genomic regions that are potentially horizontally transferred. Conclusions: The Red Sea Virgibacillus strains have a large number of biosynthetic genes in clusters that are not assigned to known products, indicating significant potential for the discovery of novel bioactive compounds. Also, having more modular synthetase units suggests that these strains are good candidates for experimental characterization of previously identified bioactive compounds as well. Future efforts will be directed towards establishing the properties of the potentially novel compounds encoded by the Red Sea specific trans-AT PKS/NRPS cluster and the type III PKS/NRPS cluster. © 2019 The Author(s).","Antimicrobial; Bacteriocins; Bioinformatics; Biosynthetic gene clusters; Genome-mining; Lanthipeptides; Nonribosomal peptides; Polyketides; Virgibacillus","bacterial genome; data mining; genetics; genomic island; genomics; metabolism; multigene family; ribosome; Virgibacillus; Data Mining; Genome, Bacterial; Genomic Islands; Genomics; Multigene Family; Ribosomes; Virgibacillus",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

However, they are also notorious for their ability to form harmful algal blooms, and cause shellfish poisoning. Although much work has been devoted to dinoflagellates in recent decades, our understanding of them at a molecular level is still limited owing to some of their challenging biological properties, such as large genome size, permanently condensed liquid-crystalline chromosomes, and the 10-fold lower ratio of protein to DNA than other eukaryotic species. In recent years, omics technologies, such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, have been applied to the study of marine dinoflagellates and have uncovered many new physiological and metabolic characteristics of dinoflagellates. In this article, we review recent application of omics technologies in revealing some of the unusual features of dinoflagellate genomes and molecular mechanisms relevant to their biology, including the mechanism of harmful algal bloom formations, toxin biosynthesis, symbiosis, lipid biosynthesis, as well as species identification and evolution.

Living organisms in coastal environments are known to synthesise large quantities of organic osmolytes, which they use to cope with osmotic stresses. The organic osmolyte glycine betaine (GBT) is ubiquitously found in marine biota from prokaryotic Bacteria and Archaea to coastal plants, marine protozoa, and mammals. In intertidal coastal sediment, GBT represents an important precursor of natural methane emissions and as much as 90% of total methane production in these ecosystems can be originated from methanogenesis from GBT and its intermediate trimethylamine through microbial metabolism. Results: We set out to uncover the microorganisms responsible for methanogenesis from GBT using stable isotope labelling and metagenomics. This led to the recovery of a near-complete genome (2.3 Mbp) of a novel clostridial bacterium involved in anaerobic GBT degradation. Phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA gene, functional marker genes, and comparative genomics analyses all support the establishment of a novel family Candidatus 'Betainaceae' fam. nov. in Clostridiales and its role in GBT metabolism. Conclusions: Our comparative genomes and metagenomics analyses suggest that this bacterium is widely distributed in coastal salt marshes, marine sediments, and deep subsurface sediments, suggesting a key role of anaerobic GBT metabolism by this clostridial bacterium in these ecosystems. © 2019 The Author(s).",,"betaine; RNA 16S; trimethylamine; betaine; methane; RNA 16S; sea water; Acidobacteria; amplicon; Article; bacterial gene; bacterial genome; Bacteroidetes; bioinformatics; Clostridiales; Deltaproteobacteria; Desulfobacteraceae; Desulfobulbaceae; DNA extraction; Firmicutes; Gammaproteobacteria; gas chromatography; genomics; geographic distribution; ion exchange chromatography; isotope labeling; marine bacterium; metagenome; metagenomics; Methanococcoides; methanogenesis; microbial community; microbial metabolism; microcosm; nonhuman; phylogenetic tree; phylogeny; priority journal; salt marsh; sequence analysis; bacterium; classification; genetics; isolation and purification; metabolism; microbiology; osmosis; sediment; United Kingdom; wetland; Bacteria; Betaine; Geologic Sediments; Metagenomics; Methane; Osmosis; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Seawater; United Kingdom; Wetlands",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Extant cyanobacteria that aggregate into cones, tufts and ridges are used to understand the long record of photosynthesis and microbe-mineral interactions during times when oxygen was much lower, i.e., the Archean and the Proterozoic. To better understand the metabolic versatility and physiological properties of these organisms, we examined publicly available genomes of cyanobacteria from modern terrestrial hydrothermal systems and a newly sequenced genome of a cyanobacterium isolated from conical and ridged microbialites that grow in occasionally sulfidic hydrothermal springs in Yellowstone National Park, USA. Phylogenomic analyses reveal that cyanobacteria from globally distributed terrestrial and shallow marine hydrothermal systems form a monophyletic clade within the Cyanobacteria phylum. Comparative genomics of this clade reveals the genetic capacity for oxygenic photosynthesis that uses photosystems I and II, and anoxygenic photosynthesis that uses a putative sulfide quinone reductase to oxidize sulfide and bypass photosystem II. Surprisingly large proportions of the newly sequenced genome from Yellowstone National Park are also dedicated to secondary metabolite production (15.1–15.6%), of which ∼6% can be attributed to antibiotic production and resistance genes. All this may be advantageous to benthic, mat-forming photosynthesizers that have to compete for light and nutrients in sporadically or permanently sulfidic environments, and may have also improved the tolerance of ancient counterparts of these cyanobacteria to sulfidic conditions in benthic communities that colonized the coastal margins in the Archean and the Proterozoic. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Comparative genomics; Cyanobacteria; Microbial ecology; Microbial mats; Phylogenomics","Archean; Article; benthos; cladistics; controlled study; cyanobacterium; environmental management; genome-wide association study; geochemistry; microbial community; nonhuman; photosynthesis; photosystem I; photosystem II; phylogeny; priority journal; Proterozoic; sequence analysis; thermal spring; chemistry; cyanobacterium; genetics; metabolism; phylogeny; thermal spring; oxygen; sulfide; Cyanobacteria; Hot Springs; Oxygen; Photosynthesis; Phylogeny; Sulfides",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

Here, the mechanism underlying the physiological effects of Mg-Fe layered double hydroxide nanoparticles on the marine bacterial species Arthrobacter oxidans KQ11 was investigated. Results: Increased yields of marine dextranase (Aodex) were obtained by exposing A. oxidans KQ11 to Mg-Fe layered double hydroxide nanoparticles (Mg-Fe-LDH NPs). Furthermore, the potential effects of Mg-Fe-LDH NPs on bacterial growth and Aodex production were preliminarily investigated. A. oxidans KQ11 growth was not affected by exposure to the Mg-Fe-LDH NPs. In contrast, a U-shaped trend of Aodex production was observed after exposure to NPs at a concentration of 10 μg/L-100 mg/L, which was due to competition between Mg-Fe-LDH NP adsorption on Aodex and the promotion of Aodex expression by the NPs. The mechanism underling the effects of Mg-Fe-LDH NPs on A. oxidans KQ11 was investigated using a combination of physiological characterization, genomics, and transcriptomics. Exposure to 100 mg/L of Mg-Fe-LDH NPs led to NP adsorption onto Aodex, increased expression of Aodex, and generation of a new Shine-Dalgarno sequence (GGGAG) and sRNAs that both influenced the expression of Aodex. Moreover, the expressions of transcripts related to ferric iron metabolic functions were significantly influenced by treatment. Conclusions: These results provide valuable information for further investigation of the A. oxidans KQ11 response to Mg-Fe-LDH NPs and will aid in achieving improved marine dextranase production, and even improve such activities in other marine microorganisms. © 2019 The Author(s).","Arthrobacter oxidans KQ11; Dextranase; Marine bacteria; Mg-Fe layered double hydroxide nanoparticles; Transcriptional profiling","Bacteria; Binary alloys; Magnesium compounds; Nanocomposites; Nanoparticles; Physiology; Transcription; Arthrobacter; Dextranase; Marine bacterium; Mg-fe layered double hydroxides; Transcriptional profiling; Iron compounds; bacterium; concentration (composition); genomics; hydrolysis; nanoparticle; polymer; RNA; Arthrobacter oxydans; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

In this study, we reported an effective method to inject exogenous materials in H. discus hannai unfertilized eggs. The injected eggs could be fertilized at a ratio of 52.6% ± 5.9% and hatch at a ratio of 14.6% ± 1.6%. On the base of this, we further developed an efficient genome editing approach in this species with the transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) technique. Two TALEN pairs targeting the coding sequence of the abalone nodal gene were assembled and tested. While one of the TALEN pairs showed no detectable mutation efficacy, the other one generated mutations in 50% of the targeted loci. The mutation includes small insertions and deletions and base pair replacements like that reported in other species when the TALEN method was applied.

Due to the growing commercial demand for new and more efficient enzymes to help further optimize these processes, many studies are now focusing their attention on more renewable and environmentally sustainable sources for the production of these enzymes. Microalgae are very promising from this perspective since they can be cultivated in photobioreactors, allowing the production of high biomass levels in a cost-efficient manner. This is reflected in the increased number of publications in this area, especially in the use of microalgae as a source of novel enzymes. In particular, various microalgal enzymes with different industrial applications (e.g., lipids and biofuel production, healthcare, and bioremediation) have been studied to date, and the modification of enzymatic sequences involved in lipid and carotenoid production has resulted in promising results. However, the entire biosynthetic pathways/systems leading to synthesis of potentially important bioactive compounds have in many cases yet to be fully characterized (e.g., for the synthesis of polyketides). Nonetheless, with recent advances in microalgal genomics and transcriptomic approaches, it is becoming easier to identify sequences encoding targeted enzymes, increasing the likelihood of the identification, heterologous expression, and characterization of these enzymes of interest. This review provides an overview of the state of the art in marine and freshwater microalgal enzymes with potential biotechnological applications and provides future perspectives for this field. © 2019 by the authors.","-omics technologies; Enzymes; Heterologous expression; Homologous expression; Marine biotechnology; Microalgae","acetate coenzyme A ligase; acyl coenzyme A desaturase; ascorbate peroxidase; asparaginase; astaxanthin; beta carotene; biofuel; canthaxanthin; carotenoid; catalase; diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1; fatty acid; glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase; glutathione reductase; glycerol 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; linoleoyl coenzyme A desaturase; lipid; nitrilase; nonribosomal peptide synthetase; palmitoyl protein thioesterase; phosphogluconate dehydrogenase; phospholipase A2; phytoene synthase; polyketide; polyketide synthase; superoxide dismutase; uridine triphosphate glucose 1 phosphate uridylyltransferase; xanthophyll; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; acute myeloid leukemia; algal genetics; amino acid sequence; antifungal activity; antineoplastic activity; biofuel production; bioremediation; biotechnology; Chlamydomonas; Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; Cyanidioschyzon merolae; drug effect; human; lipogenesis; microalga; Nannochloropsis; Nannochloropsis oceanica; nonhodgkin lymphoma; nonhuman; Phaeodactylum tricornutum; Review; Thalassiosira pseudonana; biosynthesis; biotechnology; enzymology; metabolism; microalga; procedures; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biofuels; Biosynthetic Pathways; Biotechnology; Carotenoids; Lipids; Microalgae",Review,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Kelp species have differing distribution ranges, but mainly thrive in temperate and arctic regions. Although the principal factors determining biogeographic distribution ranges are known, genomics could provide additional answers to this question. We sequenced DNA from two Laminaria species with contrasting distribution ranges, Laminaria digitata and Laminaria solidungula. Laminaria digitata is found in the Northern Atlantic with a southern boundary in Brittany (France) or Massachusetts (USA) and a northern boundary in the Arctic, whereas L. solidungula is endemic to the Arctic only. From the raw reads of DNA, we reconstructed both chloroplast genomes and annotated them. A concatenated data set of all available brown algae chloroplast sequences was used for the calculation of a robust phylogeny, and sequence variations were analyzed. The two Laminaria chloroplast genomes are collinear to previously analyzed kelp chloroplast genomes with important exceptions. Rearrangements at the inverted repeat regions led to the pseudogenization of ycf37 in L. solidungula, a gene possibly required under high light conditions. This defunct gene might be one of the reasons why the habitat range of L. solidungula is restricted to lowlight sublittoral sites in the Arctic. The inheritance pattern of single nucleotide polymorphisms suggests incomplete lineage sorting of chloroplast genomes in kelp species. Our analysis of kelp chloroplast genomes shows that not only evolutionary information could be gleaned from sequence data. Concomitantly, those sequences can also tell us something about the ecological conditions which are required for species well-being. © 2019 The Authors.

Coralligenous reefs are highly diverse habitats endemic to the Mediterranean Sea built by calcareous benthic organisms among which Crustose Coralline Algae are the main engineering species. We analyzed the diversity of Lithophyllum stictiforme or L. cabiochiae in coralligenous habitats combining a multiple barcode and a population genomics approach with seascape features. Population genomics allowed disentangling pure spatial effects from environmental effects. We found that these taxa form a complex of eight highly divergent cryptic species that are easily identifiable using classic barcode markers (psbA, LSU, COI). Three factors have a significant effect on the relative abundances of these cryptic species: the location along the French Mediterranean coast, depth and Photosynthetic Active Radiation (PAR). The analysis of around 5000 SNPs for the most abundant species revealed genetic differentiation among localities in the Bay of Marseille but no differentiation between depths within locality. Thus, the effect of depth and PAR on cryptic species communities is not a consequence of restricted connectivity but rather due to differential settlement or survival among cryptic species. This differential is more likely driven by irradiance levels rather than by pressure or temperature. Both the genetic and species diversity patterns are congruent with the main patterns of currents in the Bay. Ecological differentiation among these engineering cryptic species, sensitive to ocean warming and acidification, could have important consequences on the diversity and structure of the coralligenous communities. © 2019","Coralligenous habitats; Crustose Coralline Algae; Cryptic species; Ecological differentiation; Ecological niche; Engineering species","animal; Anthozoa; biodiversity; ecosystem; genetic variation; genetics; haplotype; Mediterranean Sea; metagenomics; phylogeny; physiology; population genetics; principal component analysis; red alga; species difference; Animals; Anthozoa; Biodiversity; Ecosystem; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Haplotypes; Mediterranean Sea; Metagenomics; Phylogeny; Principal Component Analysis; Rhodophyta; Species Specificity",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus

Here, we present the first chromosome-level marine mammal genome assembly based on the data generated by the BGISEQ-500 platform, for a stranded female sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus). Using this reference genome, we performed chromosome evolution analysis of the sperm whale, including constructing ancestral chromosomes, identifying chromosome rearrangement events and comparing with cattle chromosomes, which provides a resource for exploring marine mammal adaptation and speciation. We detected a high proportion of long interspersed nuclear elements and expanded gene families, and contraction of major histocompatibility complex region genes which were specific to sperm whale. Using comparisons with sheep and cattle, we analysed positively selected genes to identify gene pathways that may be related to adaptation to the marine environment. Further, we identified possible convergent evolution in aquatic mammals by testing for positively selected genes across three orders of marine mammals. In addition, we used publicly available resequencing data to confirm a rapid decline in global population size in the Pliocene to Pleistocene transition.

In the past several years, comparative genomics of the metallomes has arisen, which provides significant insights into the metabolism and function of metals as well as their evolution. This review focuses on recent progress in comparative genomic analysis of trace metals (such as copper, molybdenum, nickel, cobalt, selenium, iron and zinc) in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. These studies reveal distinct and dynamic evolutionary patterns of the utilization of different metals and metalloproteins. We also discuss advances in comparative metagenomic analysis of metals in microbial communities in diverse environments such as the global marine ecosystem, which offer new clues to the relationship between metal utilization and different types of environmental factors.

Here, we report 11 new pelagiphages in the Podoviridae family. Comparative genomics classified these pelagiphages into the HTVC019Pvirus genus, which includes the previously reported pelagiphages HTVC011P and HTVC019P. Phylogenomic analysis clustered HTVC019Pvirus pelagiphages into three subgroups. Integrases were identified in all but one HTVC019Pvirus genome. Site-specific integration of HTVC019Pvirus pelagiphages into host tRNA genes was verified experimentally, demonstrating the capacity of these pelagiphages to propagate by both lytic and lysogenic infection. Evidence of pelagiphage integration was also retrieved from the Global Ocean Survey database, showing that prophages are found in natural SAR11 populations. HTVC019Pvirus pelagiphages could impact SAR11 populations by a variety of mechanisms, including mortality, genetic transduction and prophage-induced viral immunity. HTVC019Pvirus pelagiphages are a rare example of cultured lysogenic phage that can be implicated in ecological processes on broad scales.

However, the genetic mechanisms underlying their unique adaptive ability are still unclear. Here, we assembled the first chromosome-level T. tridentatus genome, and proved that this genome is of high quality with contig N50 1.69 Mb. By comparison with other arthropods, some gene families of T. tridentatus experienced significant expansion, which are related to several signaling pathways, endonuclease activities, and metabolic processes. Based on the results of comparative analysis of genomics and 27 transcriptomes from nine tissues, we found that the expanded Dscam genes are located at key hub positions of immune network. Furthermore, the Dscam genes showed higher levels of expression in the yellow connective tissue (the birthplace of blood cells with strong differentiation capability) than the other eight tissues. Besides, the Dscam genes are positively correlated with the expression of the core immunity gene, clotting factor B, which is involved in the coagulation cascade reaction. The effective and unusual immune ability endowed by the expansion and expression of Dscam genes in the horseshoe crab may be a factor that makes the species have a strong environmental adaptability within ~500 million years.

Members of the diazaquinomycin (DAQ) class of natural products have shown potent and selective activity against drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, poor solubility has prevented further development of this compound class. Understanding DAQ biosynthesis may provide a viable route for the generation of derivatives with improved properties. We have sequenced the genomes of two actinomycete bacteria that produce distinct DAQ derivatives. While software tools for automated biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) prediction failed to detect DAQ BGCs, comparative genomics using MAUVE alignment led to the identification of putative BGCs in the marine Streptomyces sp. F001 and in the freshwater Micromonospora sp. B006. Deletion of the identified daq BGC in strain B006 using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing abolished DAQ production, providing experimental evidence for BGC assignment. A complete model for DAQ biosynthesis is proposed based on the genes identified. Insufficient knowledge of natural product biosynthesis is one of the major challenges of productive genome mining approaches. The results reported here fill a gap in knowledge regarding the genetic basis for the biosynthesis of DAQ antibiotics.

Here, the completeness of each of the above pathwayswas quantified and tested for the presence of all key enzymes in nano-organisms fromacross theWorldOcean. The novel marine ultrasmall prokaryotes were demonstrated to collectively harbor the genes required for carbon fixation, in particular the ""energetically efficient"" dicarboxylate/4-hydroxybutyrate pathway and the 4-hydroxybutyrate pathway. This contrasted with the known carbon metabolic pathways associated with CPR members in aquifers, where they are described as degraders (Castelle CJ, et al. 2015.Genomic expansion of domain archaea highlights roles for organisms from newphyla in anaerobic carbon cycling.

Streptomycetes are filamentous bacteria that are ubiquitous in nature and the richest source of antibiotics; however, their speciation processes remain unknown. To tackle this issue, we performed a comprehensive population genomics analysis on Streptomyces albidoflavus residing in different habitats and with a worldwide distribution and identified and characterized the foundational changes within the species. We detected three well-defined phylogenomic clades, of which clades I and III mainly contained free-living (soil/marine) and insectassociated strains, respectively, and clade II had a mixed origin. By performing genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we identified a number of genetic variants associated with free-living or entomic (denoting or relating to insects) habitats in both the accessory and core genomes. These variants contributed collectively to the population structure and had annotated or confirmed functions that likely facilitate differential adaptation of the species. In addition, we detected higher levels of homologous recombination within each clade and in the free-living group than within the whole species and in the entomic group. A subset of the insect-associated strains (clade III) showed a relatively independent evolutionary trajectory with more symbiosisfavorable genes but little genetic interchange with the other lineages. Our results demonstrate that ecological adaptation promotes genetic differentiation in S. albidoflavus, suggesting a model of ecological speciation with gene flow in streptomycetes. © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.","Adaptive evolution; Ecological differentiation; Population genomics; Speciation; Streptomycetes","Bacteria; Ecosystems; Plants (botany); Adaptive evolution; Ecological differentiation; Genomics; Speciation; Streptomycetes; Genes; adaptive radiation; antibiotics; bacterium; differentiation; divergence; ecological approach; evolutionary biology; genome; genomics; microbial activity; phylogenetics; population genetics; spatial distribution; speciation (biology); trajectory; Hexapoda; Streptomyces albidoflavus; Streptomycineae; griseocarnin; n acetylneuraminic acid; organic compound; adaptation; animal; bacterial gene; biodiversity; classification; ecology; ecosystem; gene flow; genetic variation; genetics; genome-wide association study; genotype; homologous recombination; insect; isolation and purification; metabolism; metagenomics; microbiology; molecular evolution; multigene family; phylogeny; physiology; single nucleotide polymorphism; Streptomyces; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Biodiversity; Ecology; Ecosystem; Evolution, Molecular; Gene Flow; Genes, Bacterial; Genetic Variation; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotype; Homologous Recombination; Insecta; Metagenomics; Multigene Family; N-Acetylneuraminic Acid; Organic Chemicals; Phylogeny; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Soil Microbiology; Streptomyces; Water Microbiology",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

Despite the temporal dominance of bloom formers many algal species can co-exist and compete for nutrients and space, creating a complex and diverse community. While microscopy and single cell genomics can address the taxonomic inventory, the cellular metabolome has yet to be thoroughly explored to determine the physiological status of microalgae. This might, however, provide a key to understand the observed species diversity in the homogeneous environment. Here, we introduce an effective, rapid and versatile method to analyze living single cells from aqueous substrata with laser-desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI-MS) using a simple and inexpensive matrix-free support. The cells deposited on a cultivation-medium wetted support are analyzed with minimal disturbance as they remain in their natural viable state until their disruption during LDI-MS. Metabolites desorbed from single cells are analyzed on High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HR-MS) using the Orbitrap FT-MS technology to fingerprint cellular chemistry. This live single-cell mass spectrometry (LSC-MS) allows assessing the physiological status and strain-specifics of different microalgae, including marine diatoms and freshwater chlorophytes, at the single-cell level. We further report a reliable and robust data treatment pipeline to perform multivariate statistics on the replicated LSC-MS data. Comparing single cell MS spectra from natural phytoplankton samples and from laboratory strains allows the identification and discrimination of inter and intra-specific metabolic variability and thereby has promising applications in addressing highly complex phytoplankton communities. Notably, the herein described matrix-free live-single-cell LDI-HR-MS approach enables monitoring dynamics of the plankton and might explain why key-players survive, thrive, avoid selective feeding or pathogenic virus and bacteria, while others are overcome and die. © 2019 Baumeister, Vallet, Kaftan, Svatoš and Pohnert.","Chlorophyceae Haematococcus pluvialis; Diatoms Coscinodiscus (Bacillariophyceae); Live single cell mass spectrometry; Matrix-free laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry; Microalgae; Multivariate statistics; Single-cell metabolomics",,Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Examination of the population genetics factors of many of these organisms with modern molecular methods has expanded our understanding of their evolution. Here, I provide a perspective on how selection, gene flow, genetic drift, mutation, and inbreeding have contributed to the evolution of 6 iconic Galapagos species: Flightless cormorant, pink iguana, marine iguana, Galapagos hawk, giant tortoises, and Darwin's finches. Because of the inherent biological differences among these species that have colonized the Galapagos, different population genetic factors appear to be more or less important in these different species. For example, the Galapagos provided novel environments in which strong selection took place and the Darwin's finches diversified to produce new species and the cormorant adapted to the nutrient-rich western shores of the Galapagos by losing its ability to fly and genomic data have now identified candidate genes. In both the pink iguana, which exists in one small population, and the Galapagos hawk, which has small population sizes, genetic drift has been potentially quite important. There appears to be very limited interisland gene flow in the flightless cormorant and the Galapagos hawk. On the other hand, both the marine iguana and some of the Darwin's finches appear to have significant interisland gene flow. Hybridization between species and subspecies has also introduced new adaptive variation, and in some cases, hybridization might have resulted in despeciation. Overall, new population genetics and genomics research has provided additional insight into the evolution of vertebrate species in the Galapagos. © The American Genetic Association 2018.","gene flow; genetic drift; hybridization; inbreeding; selection","Amblyrhynchus cristatus; Buteo galapagoensis; Conolophus marthae; effective population size; endemic species; evolution; extinct species; finch; gene flow; gene linkage disequilibrium; genetic drift; genetic variability; hawk; heredity; Iguana; inbreeding; inbreeding depression; island (geological); nonhuman; organism hybridization; Phalacrocorax harrisi; population genetics; population size; priority journal; Review; species diversity; subspecies; tortoise; vertebrate",Review,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus

We investigated Baltic Sea sediments with single-cell genomics, metabolomics, metatranscriptomics, and enzyme assays to identify possible subsistence mechanisms employed by uncultured Atribacteria, Aminicenantes, Actinobacteria group OPB41, Aerophobetes, Chloroflexi, Deltaproteobacteria, Desulfatiglans, Bathyarchaeota, and Euryarchaeota marine group II lineages. Some functions appeared to be shared by multiple lineages, such as trehalose production and NAD+-consuming deacetylation, both of which have been shown to increase cellular life spans in other organisms by stabilizing proteins and nucleic acids, respectively. Other possible subsistence mechanisms differed between lineages, possibly providing them different physiological niches. Enzyme assays and transcripts suggested that Atribacteria and Actinobacteria group OPB41 catabolized sugars, whereas Aminicenantes and Atribacteria catabolized peptides. Metabolite and transcript data suggested that Atribacteria utilized allantoin, possibly as an energetic substrate or chemical protectant, and also possessed energy-efficient sodium pumps. Atribacteria single-cell amplified genomes (SAGs) recruited transcripts for full pathways for the production of all 20 canonical amino acids, and the gene for amino acid exporter YddG was one of their most highly transcribed genes, suggesting that they may benefit from metabolic interdependence with other cells. Subsistence of uncultured phyla in deep subsurface sediments may occur through shared strategies of using chemical protectants for biomolecular stabilization, but also by differentiating into physiological niches and metabolic interdependencies. IMPORTANCE Much of life on Earth exists in a very slow-growing state, with microbes from deeply buried marine sediments representing an extreme example. These environments are like natural laboratories that have run multi-thousand-year experiments that are impossible to perform in a laboratory. We borrowed some techniques that are commonly used in laboratory experiments and applied them to these natural samples to make hypotheses about how these microbes subsist for so long at low activity. We found that some methods for stabilizing proteins and nucleic acids might be used by many members of the community. We also found evidence for niche differentiation strategies, and possibly cross-feeding, suggesting that even though they are barely growing, complex ecological interactions continue to occur over ultralong timescales. © 2019 Bird et al.","Deep subsurface; Enzyme assays; Low energy; Marine sediments; Metabolomics; Metatranscriptomics; Single-cell genomics; Subsistence","nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; nucleic acid; trehalose; RNA 16S; Actinobacteria; Aerophobetes; Aminicenantes; Article; Atribacteria; Baltic Sea; Bathyarchaeota; Chloroflexi; controlled study; deacetylation; Deltaproteobacteria; Desulfatiglans; enzyme assay; Euryarchaeota; gene; genetic transcription; genomics; lifespan; metabolomics; microorganism; nonhuman; priority journal; protein stability; sediment; single cell analysis; transcriptomics; archaeon; bacterium; Baltic States; classification; DNA sequence; ecosystem; genetics; growth, development and aging; metagenome; microbiology; phylogeny; sea; sediment; time factor; Archaea; Bacteria; Baltic States; Deltaproteobacteria; Ecosystem; Genomics; Geologic Sediments; Metagenome; Oceans and Seas; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Time Factors",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Our main goal was to test for genetic differentiation among eastern oyster populations from the coastal region of Canadian Maritimes against expected genetic homogeneity caused by historical events, taking into account spatial and environmental (temperature, salinity, turbidity) variation. This was achieved by genotyping 486 individuals originating from 13 locations using RADSeq. A total of 11,321 filtered SNPs were used in a combination of population genomics and environmental association analyses. We revealed significant neutral genetic differentiation (mean F ST  = 0.009) between sampling locations, and the occurrence of six major genetic clusters within the studied system. Redundancy analyses (RDAs) revealed that spatial and environmental variables explained 3.1% and 4.9% of the neutral genetic variation and 38.6% and 12.2% of the putatively adaptive genetic variation, respectively. These results indicate that these environmental factors play a role in the distribution of both neutral and putatively adaptive genetic diversity in the system. Moreover, polygenic selection was suggested by genotype–environment association analysis and significant correlations between additive polygenic scores and temperature and salinity.

The benefits of supporting invertebrate conservation genomics research (e.g., likely discovery of novel genes, protein regulatory mechanisms, genomic innovations, and transposable elements) outweigh the various hurdles (rare, small, or polymorphic starting materials). Here we review best conservation genomics practices in the laboratory and in silico when applied to marine invertebrates and also showcase unique features in several case studies of acroporid corals, crown-of-thorns starfish, apple snails, and abalone. Marine conservation genomics should also address how diversity can lead to unique marine innovations, the impact of deleterious variation, and how genomic monitoring and profiling could positively affect broader conservation goals (e.g., value of baseline data for in situ/ex situ genomic stocks).

Marine mussels of the Mytilus edulis species complex provide a good model to study mechanisms underlying species formation. They hybridise extensively at many localities and both pre- and postzygotic isolating mechanisms may be operating. Mussels have external fertilisation and sperm cells should show specific adaptations for survival and successful fertilisation. Sperm thus represent key targets in investigations of the molecular mechanisms underlying reproductive isolation. We undertook a deep transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) of mature male gonads and a 2DE/MS-based proteome analysis of sperm from Mytilus edulis and M. galloprovincialis raised in a common environment. We provide evidence of extensive expression differences between the two mussel species, and general agreement between the transcriptomic and proteomic results in the direction of expression differences between species. Differential expression is marked for mitochondrial genes and for those involved in spermatogenesis, sperm motility, sperm-egg interactions, the acrosome reaction, sperm capacitation, ATP reserves and ROS production. Proteins and their corresponding genes might thus be good targets in further genomic analysis of reproductive barriers between these closely related species. Significance: Model systems for the study of fertilization include marine invertebrates with external fertilisation, such as abalones, sea urchins and mussels, because of the ease with which large quantities of gametes released into seawater can be collected after induced spawning. Unlike abalones and sea urchins, hybridisation has been reported between mussels of different Mytilus spp., which thus makes them very appealing for the study of reproductive isolation at both pre- and postzygotic levels. There is a lack of empirical proteomic studies on sperm samples comparing different Mytilus species, which could help to advance this study. A comparative analysis of sperm proteomes across different taxa may provide important insights into the fundamental molecular processes and mechanisms involved in reproductive isolation. It might also contribute to a better understanding of sperm function and of the adaptive evolution of sperm proteins in different taxa. There is now growing evidence from genomics studies that multiple protein complexes and many individual proteins might have important functions in sperm biology and the fertilisation process. From an applied perspective, the identification of sperm-specific proteins could also contribute to the improved understanding of fertility problems and as targets for fertility control. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","External fertilisation; Gonad; Marine invertebrates; Proteomics; Reproductive isolation; Speciation; Sperm; Transcriptomics","proteome; transcriptome; proteome; acrosome reaction; amino acid sequence; Article; birth control; controlled study; gene expression; genetic difference; genomics; introspection; male; marine environment; marine invertebrate; marine species; mitochondrial gene; multiple sclerosis; Mytilus edulis; Mytilus galloprovincialis; nonhuman; priority journal; protein analysis; protein database; proteomics; reproductive isolation; RNA sequence; sea urchin; spermatogenesis; spermatozoon capacitation; spermatozoon motility; two dimensional electrophoresis; animal; genetics; metabolism; Mytilus edulis; sequence analysis; species difference; spermatozoon; Animals; Male; Mytilus edulis; Proteome; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Species Specificity; Spermatozoa",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

Effective conservation management requires a better understanding of the patterns and drivers of gene flow across a range of spatial scales. Despite the capacity for long-distance propagule dispersal, field studies suggest that mangrove propagules tend not to disperse far from the release point, which has important implications for the impact of habitat discontinuities on gene flow. We use a comprehensive seascape genomics approach to investigate this concept in the world's most widely distributed mangrove species, Avicennia marina. Location: Twenty-one sites along 2,400 km of Western Australian coastline. Methods: We used 6,162 neutral SNP loci and a hierarchical sampling design to investigate patterns of gene flow and structuring among 21 populations of A. marina. We combined these data with GIS spatial analyses in a regression model to test the relative influence of habitat continuity and geographic distance on patterns of genetic differentiation. Results: We found a complex pattern of gene flow; broadscale isolation-by-distance, disrupted by strong genetic discontinuities that coincided with gaps in mangrove distribution. These genetic discontinuities formed seven discrete subpopulations with negligible evidence for recent migration among them. The regression model combining marine geographic distance and habitat continuity as explanatory variables best fit the data, explaining 86% of the total genetic variation. Main Conclusions: Our results validate previous assertions that propagule dispersal in A. marina is spatially limited and demonstrate that significant gaps in mangrove distribution present strong barriers to stepping-stone gene flow in this species. This reiterates that dispersive life history features cannot be assumed to lead to widespread connectivity and demonstrates that effective management of these important ecosystem builders should prioritize restoring habitat continuity and minimizing further fragmentation. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Avicennia marina; genotyping-by-sequencing; habitat discontinuities; mangrove; marine connectivity; propagule dispersal; seascape genomics","connectivity; conservation management; discontinuity; dispersal; gene flow; genetic differentiation; genomics; genotype; habitat; mangrove; migration; propagule; subpopulation; Australia; Western Australia; Avicennia marina",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus

Using publicly available small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene databases, high-throughput environmental sequencing (HTES) surveys, and our own generated HTES data, we developed an apicomplexan reference database, which includes the largest apicomplexan SSU rRNA tree available to date and encompasses comprehensive sampling of this group and their closest relatives. This tree allowed us to identify and correct incongruences in the molecular identification of apicomplexan sequences. Analyzing the diversity and distribution of apicomplexans in HTES studies with this curated reference database also showed a widespread, and quantitatively important, presence of apicomplexans across a variety of free-living environments. These data allow us to describe a remarkable molecular diversity of this group compared with our current knowledge, especially when compared with that identified from described apicomplexan species. This is most striking in marine environments, where potentially the most diverse apicomplexans apparently exist, but have not yet been formally recognized. The new database will be useful for microbial ecology and epidemiological studies, and provide valuable reference for medical and veterinary diagnosis especially in cases of emerging, zoonotic, and cryptic infections. © 2019 del Campo, Heger, Rodríguez-Martínez, Worden, Richards, Massana and Keeling.","Apicomplexans; Classification; Distribution; Diversity; Environmental sequencing; Metabarcoding; Phylogeny; Reference database","small subunit ribosomal RNA; amplicon; Apicomplexa; Article; biodiversity; conceptual framework; cryptosporidiosis; Cryptosporidium; ecology; gene sequence; genomics; high throughput sequencing; human; knowledge; malaria; maximum likelihood method; molecular biology; nonhuman; phylogeny; piroplasmosis; Plasmodium falciparum; taxonomy; toxoplasmosis",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Short-read viral metagenomic studies have provided clues to viral function and first estimates of global viral gene abundance and distribution, but their assemblies are confounded by populations with high levels of strain evenness and nucleotide diversity (microdiversity), limiting assembly of some of the most abundant viruses on Earth. Such features also challenge assembly across genomic islands containing niche-defining genes that drive ecological speciation. These populations and features may be successfully captured by single-virus genomics and fosmid-based approaches, at least in abundant taxa, but at considerable cost and technical expertise. Here we established a low-cost, low-input, high throughput alternative sequencing and informatics workflow to improve viral metagenomic assemblies using short-read and long-read technology. The VirION' (Viral, long-read metagenomics via MinION sequencing) approach was first validated using mock communities where it was found to be as relatively quantitative as short-read methods and provided significant improvements in recovery of viral genomes. We then then applied VirION to the first metagenome from a natural viral community from the Western English Channel. In comparison to a short-read only approach, VirION: (i) increased number and completeness of assembled viral genomes; (ii) captured abundant, highly microdiverse virus populations, and (iii) captured more and longer genomic islands. Together, these findings suggest that VirION provides a high throughput and cost-effective alternative to fosmid and single-virus genomic approaches to more comprehensively explore viral communities in nature. © Copyright 2019 Warwick-Dugdale et al.","Assembly; Long-read sequencing; Marine microbiology; Metagenome; Viral ecology; Viral metagenomics; Virome; Virus","article; ecology; English Channel; fosmid; genomic island; information science; metagenome; metagenomics; microbiology; quantitative analysis; virion; virus genome; workflow",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

In particular, OMVs are powerful effectors in interorganismal interactions, driven largely by their molecular contents. These impacts have been studied extensively in bacterial pathogenesis but have not been well documented within the context of mutualism. Here, we examined the proteomic composition of OMVs from the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri, which forms a specific mutualism with the Hawaiian bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes. We found that V. fischeri upregulates transcription of its major outer membrane protein, OmpU, during growth at an acidic pH, which V. fischeri experiences when it transitions from its environmental reservoir to host tissues. We used comparative genomics and DNA pulldown analyses to search for regulators of ompU and found that differential expression of ompU is governed by the OmpR, H-NS, and ToxR proteins. This transcriptional control combines with nutritional conditions to govern OmpU levels in OMVs. Under a host-encountered acidic pH, V. fischeri OMVs become more potent stimulators of symbiotic host development in an OmpU-dependent manner. Finally, we found that symbiotic development could be stimulated by OMVs containing a homolog of OmpU from the pathogenic species Vibrio cholerae, connecting the role of a well-described virulence factor with a mutualistic element. This work explores the symbiotic effects of OMV variation, identifies regulatory machinery shared between pathogenic and mutualistic bacteria, and provides evidence of the role that OMVs play in animal-bacterium mutualism. IMPORTANCE Beneficial bacteria communicate with their hosts through a variety of means. These communications are often carried out by a combination of molecules that stimulate responses from the host and are necessary for development of the relationship between these organisms. Naturally produced bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) contain many of those molecules and can stimulate a wide range of responses from recipient organisms. Here, we describe how a marine bacterium, Vibrio fischeri, changes the makeup of its OMVs under conditions that it experiences as it goes from its free-living lifestyle to associating with its natural host, the Hawaiian bobtail squid. This work improves our understanding of how bacteria change their signaling profile as they begin to associate with their beneficial partner animals. © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.

Access to marine genetic resources (MGR) for the biodiversity research community is essential to allow these environments to be better characterised. Negotiations have commenced under the auspices of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to develop a new treaty to further the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in ABNJ. It is timely to consider the relevant issues with the development of the treaty underway. Currently uncertainties surround the legal definition of MGR and scope of related benefit-sharing, against a background of regional and global governance gaps in ABNJ. These complications are mirrored in science, with recent major advances in the field of genomics, but variability in handling of the resulting increasing volumes of data. Here, we attempt to define the concept of MGR from a scientific perspective, review current practices for the generation of and access to MGR from ABNJ in the context of relevant regulations, and illustrate the utility of best-practice with a case study. We contribute recommendations with a view to strengthen best-practice in accessibility of MGR, including: funder recognition of the central importance of taxonomy/biodiversity research; support of museums/collections for long-term sample curation; open access to data; usage and further development of globally recognised data standards and platforms; publishing of datasets via open-access, quality controlled and standardised data systems and open access journals; commitment to best-practice workflows; a global registry of cruises; and lastly development of a clearing house to further centralised access to the above. We argue that commitment to best-practice would allow greater sharing of MGR for research and extensive secondary use including conservation and environmental monitoring, and provide an exemplar for access and benefit-sharing (ABS) to inform the biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ) process. © 2019 Rabone, Harden-Davies, Collins, Zajderman, Appeltans, Droege,Brandt, Pardo-Lopez, Dahlgren, Glover and Horton.","Access and benefit-sharing (ABS); Areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ); Biodiversity; Conservation; Data standards; Marine genetic resources (MGR); Open access; Taxonomy",,Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Due to the lack of a universal conserved gene among all viruses, metagenomic fragment recruitment is commonly used to estimate the relative viral abundance. However, the paucity of absolute virus abundance data hinders our ability to fully understand how viruses drive global microbial populations. The cosmopolitan marine Pelagibacter ubique is host for the highly widespread HTVC010P pelagiphage isolate and the extremely abundant uncultured virus vSAG 37-F6 recently discovered by single-virus genomics. Here we applied droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to calculate the absolute abundance of these pelagiphage genotypes in the Mediterranean Sea and the Gulf of Maine. Abundances were between 360 and 8, 510 virus mL-1 and 1, 270-14, 400 virus mL-1 for vSAG 37-F6 and HTVC010P, respectively. Illumina PCR-amplicon sequencing corroborated the absence of ddPCR non-specific amplifications for vSAG 37-F6, but showed an overestimation of 6% for HTVC010P from off-targets, genetically unrelated viruses. Absolute abundances of both pelagiphages, two of the most abundance marine viruses, suggest a large viral pelagiphage diversity in marine environments, and show the efficiency and power of ddPCR to disentangle the structure of marine viral communities. Results also highlight the need for a standardized workflow to obtain accurate quantification that allows cross data comparison.

We herein describe the profound potential of Alteromonas sp. 76-1, isolated from alginate-enriched seawater at the Patagonian continental shelf, to degrade the algal polysaccharides alginate and ulvan. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that strain 76-1 might represent a novel species, distinguished from its closest relative (Alteromonas naphthalenivorans) by adaptations to their contrasting habitats (productive open ocean vs. coastal sediments). Ecological distinction of 76-1 was particularly manifested in the abundance of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), consistent with its isolation from alginate-enriched seawater and elevated abundance of a related OTU in the original microcosm. Strain 76-1 encodes multiple alginate lyases from families PL6, PL7, PL17, and PL18 largely contained in two polysaccharide utilization loci (PUL), which may facilitate the utilization of different alginate structures in nature. Notably, ulvan degradation relates to a 126 Kb plasmid dedicated to polysaccharide utilization, encoding several PL24 and PL25 ulvan lyases and monomer-processing genes. This extensive and versatile CAZyme repertoire allowed substantial growth on polysaccharides, showing comparable doubling times with alginate (2 h) and ulvan (3 h) in relation to glucose (3 h). The finding of homologous ulvanolytic systems in distantly related Alteromonas spp. suggests CAZyme plasmids as effective vehicles for PUL transfer that mediate niche gain. Overall, the demonstrated CAZyme repertoire substantiates the role of Alteromonas in marine polysaccharide degradation and how PUL exchange influences the ecophysiology of this ubiquitous marine taxon. © 2019 Koch, Freese, Hahnke, Simon and Wietz.","Alginate; Niche specialization; Polysaccharide utilization loci; Ulvan; Unique genes","alginate lyases; alginic acid; esterase; glycosidase; glycosyltransferase; hydrolase; lyase; polysaccharide; polysaccharide lyase; polysaccharide sulfate; siderophore; ulvan; unclassified drug; alginolysis; Alteromonas; Alteromonas macleodii; Alteromonas naphthalenivorans; antibacterial activity; Article; bacterium isolation; bioassay; bioinformatics; controlled study; degradation; DNA extraction; enzyme activity; gene sequence; growth rate; hydrolysis; lysis; nonhuman; photometry; phylogeny; plasmid; polymerase chain reaction; pulsed field gel electrophoresis; sequence alignment; taxonomy; transcriptomics; well diffusion assay; whole genome sequencing",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

The Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) has recently been recognized as the world's longest-lived vertebrate, but many questions regarding its biology, physiology, and ecology remain unanswered. Here we review how current and future research will fill knowledge gaps about the Greenland shark and provide an overall framework to guide research and management priorities for this species. Key advances include the potential for specialized aging techniques and demographic studies to shed light on the distribution and age-class structure of Greenland shark populations. Advances in population genetics and genomics will reveal key factors contributing to the Greenland shark's extreme longevity, range and population size, and susceptibility to environmental change. New tagging technologies and improvements in experimental and analytical design will allow detailed monitoring of movement behaviors and interactions among Greenland sharks and other marine species, while shedding light on habitat use and susceptibility to fisheries interactions. Interdisciplinary approaches, such as the combined use of stable isotope analysis and high-tech data-logging devices (i.e., accelerometers and acoustic hydrophones) have the potential to improve knowledge of feeding strategies, predatory capabilities, and the trophic role of Greenland sharks. Measures of physiology, including estimation of metabolic rate, as well as heart rate and function, will advance our understanding of the causes and consequences of long lifespans. Determining the extent and effects of current threats (as well as potential mitigation measures) will assist the development of policies, recommendations, and actions relevant for the management of this potentially vulnerable species.

Exiguobacterium can grow in a wide range of temperature, pH, salinity, and heavy-metal concentrations. We characterized Exiguobacterium chiriqhucha strain RW2 isolated from a permanently cold freshwater microbialite in Pavilion Lake, British Columbia using metabolic assays, genomics, comparative genomics, phylogenetics, and fatty acid composition. Strain RW2 has the most extensive growth range for temperature (4-50°C) and pH (5-11) of known Exiguobacterium isolates. Strain RW2 genome predicts pathways for wide differential thermal, cold and osmotic stress using cold and heat shock cascades (e.g., csp and dnaK), choline and betaine uptake/biosynthesis (e.g., opu and proU), antiporters (e.g., arcD and nhaC Na+/K+), membrane fatty acid unsaturation and saturation. Here, we provide the first complete genome from Exiguobacterium chiriqhucha strain RW2, which was isolated from a freshwater microbialite. Its genome consists of a single 3,019,018 bp circular chromosome encoding over 3,000 predicted proteins, with a GC% content of 52.1%, and no plasmids. In addition to growing at a wide range of temperatures and salinities, our findings indicate that RW2 is resistant to sulfisoxazole and has the genomic potential for detoxification of heavy metals (via mercuric reductases, arsenic resistance pumps, chromate transporters, and cadmium-cobalt-zinc resistance genes), which may contribute to the metabolic potential of Pavilion Lake microbialites. Strain RW2 could also contribute to microbialite formation, as it is a robust biofilm former and encodes genes involved in the deamination of amino acids to ammonia (i.e., L-asparaginase/urease), which could potentially boost carbonate precipitation by lowering the local pH and increasing alkalinity. We also used comparative genomic analysis to predict the pathway for orange pigmentation that is conserved across the entire Exiguobacterium genus, specifically, a C30 carotenoid biosynthesis pathway is predicted to yield diaponeurosporene-4-oic acid as its final product.

They are major primary producers and highly active predators in marine and fresh water systems. While genomics has accelerated in recent years for this taxonomically diverse group, our understanding of the metabolic capabilities of most protists remains limited. It is also poorly understood how protist trophic mode is affected by biotic and abiotic factors, and therefore it is difficult to predict how events such as global climate change will affect the balance between autotrophic and heterotrophic activities in protist communities. To address open questions regarding how protist metabolic versatility is influenced by their environment, we characterized the potential for carbon fixation versus organic carbon degradation using enzymatic assays (RubisCO and β-D-glucosaminidase, respectively) within the water columns of ice-covered lakes in McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV), Antarctica. Steep physical and chemical gradients in the water columns, microorganism domination and minimal allochthonous inputs makes the MDV lakes uniquely suited to investigate environment-microbe interactions. Spatial trends in RubisCO and β-D-glucosaminidase activities were lake-specific and vertically stratified within the water columns. Moreover, bottom-up drivers controlling the activity of C-fixation vs. organic C-degradation among the MDV protist communities were distinct between the upper photic vs. The deep, aphotic zones. We conclude that differential controls over major C-cycling enzymes have important implications on the influence of environmental change on the carbon and nutrient cycles in the MDV lakes. © 2019 Inter-Research.","Antarctic lakes; Aquatic protests; Autotrophy; Heterotrophy; McMurdo Dry Valleys; RubisCO; β-D-glucosaminidase",,Article,"",Scopus

Our analyses focused on a nuclear gene (atp5c1) that was previously detected in an FST scan as highly structured among populations separated by the Finistre Peninsula in France. This gene encodes the gamma subunit of the FO/F1 ATP synthase, a multiprotein complex that is paramount to cellular respiration and energy production. Analysis of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutation ratios revealed that 65% of the gene is highly conserved (dN/dS0.1, min = 0), while 6% of the gene is likely under positive selection (dN/dS = 1, max = 2.03). All replacement mutations are clustered on a 46 residues portion of the protein, within an inter-peptide interaction zone. Comparative genomics suggests that these mutations are evolutionarily stable, and we hypothesize that they are involved in inter-population genetic incompatibilities with other subunits of the ATP synthase complex. The protein stability of the gamma subunit conferred by southern variants was inferred to be higher under warmer temperatures, suggesting that environmental conditions may contribute to the strength of genetic barriers in L. balthica. © EDP Sciences 2019.","ATP synthase; Genetic incompatibilities; Local adaptation; Macoma balthica; Molecular evolution; Selection","bivalve; cytoplasmic incompatibility; gene; gene expression; genetic analysis; genomics; local adaptation; marine environment; molecular analysis; mutation; natural selection; protein; Bretagne; Finistere; France; Bivalvia; Macoma balthica",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

To date, the coexistence of these two carbon fixation pathways had not been found in a cultured bacterium and could thus not be studied in detail. Moreover, it was not clear if these two pathways were encoded in the same symbiont individual, or if two symbiont populations, each with one of the pathways, coexisted within tubeworms. With comparative genomics, we show that Thioflavicoccus mobilis, a cultured, free-living gammaproteobacterial sulfur oxidizer, possesses the genes for both carbon fixation pathways. Here, we also show that both the CBB and rTCA pathways are likely encoded in the genome of the sulfur-oxidizing symbiont of the tubeworm Escarpia laminata from deep-sea asphalt volcanoes in the Gulf of Mexico. Finally, we provide genomic and transcriptomic data suggesting a potential electron flow toward the rTCA cycle carboxylase 2-oxoglutarate: ferredoxin oxidoreductase, via a rare variant of NADH dehydrogenase/heterodisulfide reductase in the E. laminata symbiont.

Here we ask how widespread is virulence among ecologically differentiated Vibrio populations, and what is the nature and frequency of virulence genes within these populations? We use a combination of population genomics and molecular genetics to assay hundreds of Vibrio strains for their virulence in the oyster Crassostrea gigas, a unique animal model that allows high-throughput infection assays. We show that within the diverse Splendidus clade, virulence represents an ancestral trait but has been lost from several populations. Two loci are necessary for virulence, the first being widely distributed across the Splendidus clade and consisting of an exported conserved protein (R5.7). The second is a MARTX toxin cluster, which only occurs within V. splendidus and is for the first time associated with virulence in marine invertebrates.

As marine macroalgae are known to be rich in various types of polysaccharides, seaweed-associated bacteria are likely to be a good source of these CAZymes. A genomics approach can be used to explore CAZyme abundance and diversity, but it can also provide deep insights into the biology of CAZyme producers and, in particular, into molecular mechanisms that mediate their interaction with their hosts. In this study, a Gram-negative, aerobic, rod-shaped, carrageenolytic, and culturable marine bacterium designated as AOL6 was isolated from a diseased thallus of a carrageenan-producing farmed rhodophyte, Kappaphycus alvarezii (Gigartinales, Rhodophyta). The whole genome of this bacterium was sequenced and characterized. Sequence reads were assembled producing a high-quality genome assembly. The estimated genome size of the bacterium is 4.4 Mb and a G+C content of 52%. Molecular phylogenetic analysis based on a complete sequence of 16S rRNA, rpoB, and a set of 38 single-copy genes suggests that the bacterium is an unknown species and represents a novel genus in the family Cellvibrionaceae that is most closely related to the genera Teredinibacter and Saccharophagus. Genome comparison with T. turnerae T7901 and S. degradans 2-40 reveals several features shared by the three species, including a large number of CAZymes that comprised > 5% of the total number of protein-coding genes. The high proportion of CAZymes found in the AOL6 genome exceeds that of other known carbohydrate degraders, suggesting a significant capacity to degrade a range of polysaccharides including κ-carrageenan; 34% of these CAZymes have signal peptide sequences for secretion. Three putative κ-carrageenase-encoding genes were identified from the genome of the bacterium via in silico analysis, consistent with the results of the zymography assay (with κ-carrageenan as substrate). Genome analysis also indicated that AOL6 relies exclusively on type 2 secretion system (T2SS) for secreting proteins (possibly including glycoside hydrolases). In relation to T2SS, the product of the pilZ gene was predicted to be highly expressed, suggesting specialization for cell adhesion and secretion of virulence factors. The assignment of proteins to clusters of orthologous groups (COGs) revealed a pattern characteristic of r-strategists. Majority of two-component system proteins identified in the AOL6 genome were also predicted to be involved in chemotaxis and surface colonization. These genomic features suggest that AOL6 is an opportunistic pathogen, adapted to colonizing polysaccharide-rich hosts, including carrageenophytes. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","CAZymes; Cellvibrionaceae; Kappaphycus alvarezii; Phylogenetics; Two-component system (TCS)","Bacteria; Biochemistry; Carbohydrates; Cell adhesion; Hydrolases; Physiology; Plants (botany); Polysaccharides; RNA; CAZymes; Cellvibrionaceae; Kappaphycus alvarezii; Phylogenetics; Two-component systems; Genes; bacterium; enzyme activity; genomics; pathogenicity; phylogenetics; polysaccharide; red alga; Bacteria (microorganisms); Gigartinales; Kappaphycus alvarezii; Negibacteria; Rhodophyta; Saccharophagus; Saccharophagus degradans 2-40; Teredinibacter; Teredinibacter turnerae; bacterial protein; carrageenan; DNA directed RNA polymerase; RNA 16S; bacterial genome; carbohydrate metabolism; classification; DNA sequence; enzymology; Gammaproteobacteria; genetics; metabolism; microbiology; red alga; Bacterial Proteins; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Carrageenan; DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases; Gammaproteobacteria; Genome, Bacterial; Rhodophyta; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, DNA",Article,"",Scopus

Pseudoalteromonas are marine bacteria found in versatile environments, of which QS regulation for their habitat adaptation is extremely fragmentary. To distinguish genes required for QS regulation in Pseudoalteromonas, comparative genomics was deployed to define the pan‐genomics for twelve isolates and previously‐sequenced genomes, of which acyl‐homoserine lactone (AHL)‐based QS traits were characterized. Additionally, transposon mutagenesis was used to identify the essential QS regulatory genes in the selected Pseudoalteromonas isolate. A remarkable feature showed that AHL‐based colorization intensity of biosensors induced by Pseudoalteromonas most likely correlates with QS regulators genetic heterogeneity within the genus. This is supported by the relative expression levels of two of the main QS regulatory genes (luxO and rpoN) analyzed in representative Pseudoalteromonas isolates. Notably, comprehensive QS regulatory schema and the working model proposed in Pseudoalteromonas seem to phylogenetically include the network architectures derived from Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas, and Vibrio. Several associated genes were mapped by transposon mutagenesis. Among them, a right origin‐binding protein‐encoding gene (robp) was functionally identified as a positive QS regulatory gene. This gene lies on a genomic instable region and exists in the aforementioned bioinformatically recruited QS regulatory schema. The obtained data emphasize that the distinctly‐ and hierarchically‐organized mechanisms probably target QS association in Pseudoalteromonas dynamic genomes, thus leading to bacterial ability to accommodate their adaption fitness and survival advantages. © 2017 by the authors.

Since 1920s, Chinese scientists have carried out a series of studies on the biology and conservation of marine mammals in Chinese waters through multidisciplinary methods. Especially some important advances were made on the biology and conservation of the baiji (Lipotes vexillifer), finless porpoises (Neophocaena spp.) and Chinese white dolphins (Sousa chinensis), evolutionary history and adaptive mechanism of secondary aquatic adaptation, and population genetic diversity etc, which not only improved our understanding of understandings of marine mammals in China, but promoted their conservation and management. Here we reveiwed the research progresses of marine mammals in China from seven aspects such as diversity, ecology and conservation biology, morphology and anatomy, breeding and reproductive biology, acoustic behavior, genetic and evolutionary biology, and genomics etc. In the future, some more attention should be paid to the evolutionary history and adaptive mechanism of secondary aquatic adaptation, whereas it is of great importance to reveal the mechanisms underlying the endangerment of marine mammals and provide adaptive strategies for their conservation and management. © 2018, Science Press.

The marine environments contain many contaminants of anthropogenic origin that have sufficient similarities to steroid and thyroid hormones, to potentially disrupt normal endocrine physiology in humans, fish, and other animals. An appropriate understanding of the effects of these endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) on forage fish (e.g., sardine, anchovy, mackerel) can lead to significant insight into how these contaminants may affect local ecosystems in addition to their potential impacts on human health. With advancements in molecular tools (e.g., high-throughput sequencing, HTS), a genomics approach offers a robust toolkit to discover putative genetic biomarkers in fish exposed to these chemicals. However, the lack of available sequence information for non-model species has limited the development of these genomic toolkits. Using HTS and de novo assembly technology, the present study aimed to establish, for the first time for Sardinops sagax (Pacific sardine), Scomber japonicas (Pacific chub mackerel) and Pleuronichthys verticalis (hornyhead turbot), a de novo global transcriptome database of the liver, the primary organ involved in detoxification.

Three phylogenetically distinct flagellar gene clusters (FGCs) have been identified in Rhodobacteraceae that have been named fla1, fla2 and fla3 according to their relative abundance. In addition to the flagellar-dependent swimming and swarming motility, pilus-dependent twitching mediates bacterial locomotion. Furthermore, filament independent modes of motility, namely gliding and sliding, have been described for various microorganisms. However, no mode of motility other than swimming has so far been described for roseobacters. In the present study, we investigated motility, distribution of flagellar systems and the phylogeny of 120 genome-sequenced Rhodobacteraceae. The phylogenetically broad taxon sampling that included 114 type strains revealed the presence of at least ten distinct clades that were statistically well supported. The investigation of the actual physiological capacity for swimming motility on soft agar plates showed that only about half of the 120 tested strains were motile under the tested conditions. Seven strains developed a conspicuous dendritic motility phenotype that was reminiscent of the swarming motility in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The observed dendritic motility in two strains (i.e. Sulfitobacter pseudonitzschiae DSM 26842 and Roseovarius pacificus DSM 29589) was particularly surprising because they did not harbor any genes of the FGC. Accordingly, it was concluded that this form of dendritic motility was independent of a flagellum.

Complete genome sequencing uncovered that the bacterium encodes 3985 protein-coding sequences (CDSs) on two chromosomes and 62 CDSs on the virulence plasmid pEIB1. To investigate the genes that are essential for its in vitro and in vivo growth, we applied transposon insertion sequencing technology (Tn-seq) to screen a highly saturated transposon insertion mutant library grown in Luria-Bertani broth with 2% NaCl (LB20) and in its natural host turbot. Tn-seq identified 473 and ∼173 putative genes as essential for its growth in rich medium and the in vivo infection process, respectively. Additionally, our analysis revealed that the genes are associated to various fitness levels in the liver, spleen and kidney, suggesting different genetic requirements for colonization in these organs. Furthermore, we validated our Tn-seq data using gene knockout mutants and in vivo infection experiments. Comprehensive functional genomics analysis highlighted the conditionally essential genes for important pathways involved in energy metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, nucleotide synthesis, amino acid synthesis, cofactors, siderophore synthesis, secretion (T1SS, T2SS, and T6SS), quorum sensing, and flagellum biosynthesis.

However, this approach provides little information and sometimes causes a misinterpretation of the results owing to the limitations of primer sequence design and biases in PCR reactions. Indeed, because many microbiologists perceive this issue, metagenomics is shifting toward PCR-independent comprehensive functional analyses from conventional 16S rDNA-based metagenomic analyses. To facilitate this trend in current metagenomics research, we developed a new method based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes functional modules to elucidate the comprehensive functions (i.e., functionomes) of individual organisms and whole microbial communities. We also developed the metabolic and physiological potential evaluator (MAPLE) system, which can automatically perform a series of analyses used to evaluate the potential functionome encoded by genomes and metagenomes. This chapter provides some examples of functional genomics and metagenomics to clarify the functional diversity between individual organisms and also between microbial consortia across diverse environments. Through a series of analyses using MAPLE, we have shown that it is possible to functionally classify archaeal species based on patterns of module completion ratio. We have also highlighted the functional diversity among closely related Lysobacter species that produce valuable antimicrobial enzymes and their core genome structures. Additionally, we characterized community structures based on ribosomal proteins instead of 16S rDNA sequences and revealed differences in potential functionomes among four marine metagenomic samples from a global ocean sampling expedition. Finally, we highlighted the functional diversity of human gut microbiomes from 13 healthy Japanese individuals and the differences in biodiversity for the glycolysis module, which is a major component of central carbohydrate metabolism. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

While adaptation to local environmental conditions depends on a balance between dispersal and natural selection across the seascape, the spatial scale of adaptation and the relative importance of mechanisms maintaining adaptation in the ocean are not well understood. Here, using population assignment tests, Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), and genome scans with double-digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing data, we evaluated population structure and locus–environment associations in a commercially important species, summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus), along the U.S. east coast. Based on 1,137 single nucleotide polymorphisms across 232 individuals spanning nearly 1,900 km, we found no indication of population structure across Cape Hatteras, North Carolina (FST = 0.0014) or of isolation by distance along the coast using individual relatedness. ABC estimated the probability of dispersal across the biogeographic break at Cape Hatteras to be high (95% credible interval: 7%–50% migration). However, we found 15 loci whose allele frequencies were associated with at least one of four environmental variables. Of those, 11 were correlated with bottom temperature. For summer flounder, our results suggest continued fisheries management as a single population and identify likely response mechanisms to climate change. Broadly speaking, our findings suggest that spatial balancing selection can manifest in adaptive divergence on regional scales in marine fish despite high dispersal, and that these conditions likely result in the widespread distribution of adaptive alleles and a high potential for future genetic adaptation in response to changing environmental conditions. In the context of a rapidly changing world, a landscape genomics perspective offers a useful approach for understanding the causes and consequences of genetic differentiation. © 2018 The Authors.

In particular, vibrios dominate, i.e. up to 10% of the readily culturable marine bacteria in these habitats. The distribution of Vibrio spp. is shaped by various environmental parameters, notably temperature, salinity and dissolved organic carbon. Vibriospp. may utilize a wide range of organic carbon compounds, including chitin (this may be metabolized by most Vibrio spp.), alginic acid and agar. Many Vibrio spp. have very short replication times (as short as ~10 min), which could facilitate them developing into high biomass content albeit for relatively short durations. Although Vibriospp. usually comprise a minor portion (typically ~1% of the total bacterioplankton in coastal waters) of the total microbial population, they have been shown to proliferate explosively in response to various nutrient pulses, e.g., organic nutrients from algae blooms and iron (Fe+) from Saharan dust.

Here we track the genome evolution of the globally abundant marine bacterial phylum Marinimicrobia across its diversification into modern marine environments and demonstrate that extant lineages are partitioned between epipelagic and mesopelagic habitats. Moreover, we show that these habitat preferences are associated with fundamental differences in genomic organization, cellular bioenergetics, and metabolic modalities. Multiple lineages present in epipelagic niches independently acquired genes necessary for pho-totrophy and environmental stress mitigation, and their genomes convergently evolved key features associated with genome streamlining. In contrast, lineages residing in mesopelagic waters independently acquired nitrate respiratory machinery and a variety of cytochromes, consistent with the use of alternative terminal electron acceptors in oxygen minimum zones (OMZs). Further, while epipelagic clades have retained an ancestral Na + -pumping respiratory complex, mesopelagic lineages have largely replaced this complex with canonical H + -pumping respiratory complex I, potentially due to the increased efficiency of the latter together with the presence of the more energy-limiting environments deep in the ocean’s interior. These parallel evolutionary trends indicate that key features of genomic streamlining and cellular bioenergetics have occurred repeatedly and congruently in disparate clades and underscore the importance of environmental conditions and nutrient dynamics in driving the evolution of diverse bacterioplankton lineages in similar ways throughout the global ocean. IMPORTANCE Understanding long-term patterns of microbial evolution is critical to advancing our knowledge of past and present role microbial life in driving global biogeochemical cycles. Historically, it has been challenging to study the evolution of environmental microbes due to difficulties in obtaining genome sequences from lineages that could not be cultivated, but recent advances in metagenomics and single-cell genomics have begun to obviate many of these hurdles. Here we present an evolutionary genomic analysis of the Marinimicrobia, a diverse bacterial group that is abundant in the global ocean. We demonstrate that distantly related Marinimicrobia species that reside in similar habitats have converged to assume similar genome architectures and cellular bioenergetics, suggesting that common factors shape the evolution of a broad array of marine lineages. These findings broaden our understanding of the evolutionary forces that have given rise to microbial life in the contemporary ocean. © 2018 Getz et al.","Bioenergetics; Candidate phyla; Evolutionary genomics; Genome streamlining; Microbial oceanography; Pangenomics","cytochrome; nitrate; proton; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (ubiquinone); sodium ion; Article; bacterial genome; bacterioplankton; bioenergy; cell energy; cladistics; controlled study; ecological niche; electron; environmental stress; evolution; habitat; marine bacterium; marine environment; Marinimicrobia; metabolism; microbial diversity; nonhuman; nutrient dynamics; ocean environment; oxygen minimum zone; parallel evolution; pelagic zone; phototrophy; priority journal; ultraviolet radiation; adaptation; aquatic species; bacterium; ecosystem; energy metabolism; genetics; molecular evolution; Adaptation, Biological; Aquatic Organisms; Bacteria; Ecosystem; Energy Metabolism; Evolution, Molecular; Genome, Bacterial; Metabolic Networks and Pathways",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Unfortunately, many phylogenetically novel groups have never been cultured, so their physiologies have only been inferred from genomics and environmental characteristics. Although the diversity, or number of different taxonomic groups, of uncultured clades has been studied well, their global abundances, or numbers of cells in any given environment, have not been assessed. We quantified the degree of similarity of 16S rRNA gene sequences from diverse environments in publicly available metagenome and metatranscriptome databases, which we show have far less of the culture bias present in primer-amplified 16S rRNA gene surveys, to those of their nearest cultured relatives. Whether normalized to scaffold read depths or not, the highest abundances of metagenomic 16S rRNA gene sequences belong to phylogenetically novel uncultured groups in seawater, freshwater, terrestrial subsurface, soil, hypersaline environments, marine sediment, hot springs, hydrothermal vents, nonhuman hosts, snow, and bioreactors (22% to 87% uncultured genera to classes and 0% to 64% uncultured phyla). The exceptions were human and human-associated environments, which were dominated by cultured genera (45% to 97%). We estimate that uncultured genera and phyla could comprise 7.3 1029 (81%) and 2.2 1029 (25%) of microbial cells, respectively. Uncultured phyla were overrepresented in metatranscriptomes relative to metagenomes (46% to 84% of sequences in a given environment), suggesting that they are viable. Therefore, uncultured microbes, often from deeply phylogenetically divergent groups, dominate nonhuman environments on Earth, and their undiscovered physiologies may matter for Earth systems. IMPORTANCE In the past few decades, it has become apparent that most of the microbial diversity on Earth has never been characterized in laboratory cultures. We show that these unknown microbes, sometimes called “microbial dark matter,” are numerically dominant in all major environments on Earth, with the exception of the human body, where most of the microbes have been cultured. We also estimate that about one-quarter of the population of microbial cells on Earth belong to phyla with no cultured relatives, suggesting that these never-before-studied organisms may be important for ecosystem functions.

Biologists infer likely properties of nodal organisms within the tree and, hence, the environment they inhabited. Geologists both vet tenuous trees and putative origin of life scenarios for geological and ecological reasonability and conversely infer geological information from trees. The latter approach is valuable as geologists have only weakly constrained the time when the Earth became habitable and the later time when life actually existed to the long interval between ∼4.5 and ∼3.85 Ga where no intact surface rocks are known. With regard to vetting, origin and early evolution hypotheses from molecular biology have recently centered on serpentinite settings in marine and alternatively land settings that are exposed to ultraviolet sunlight. The existence of these niches on the Hadean Earth is virtually certain. With regard to inferring geological environment from genomics, nodes on the tree of life can arise from true bottlenecks implied by the marine serpentinite origin scenario and by asteroid impact. Innovation of a very useful trait through a threshold allows the successful organism to quickly become very abundant and later root a large clade. The origin of life itself, that is, the initial Darwinian ancestor, the bacterial and archaeal roots as free-living cellular organisms that independently escaped hydrothermal chimneys above marine serpentinite or alternatively from shallow pore-water environments on land, the Selabacteria root with anoxygenic photosynthesis, and the Terrabacteria root colonizing land are attractive examples that predate the geological record. Conversely, geological reasoning presents likely events for appraisal by biologists. Asteroid impacts may have produced bottlenecks by decimating life. Thermophile roots of bacteria and archaea as well as a thermophile LUCA are attractive. © 2018 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",,"anaerobic growth; astronomy; biogenesis; biota; evolution; geographic and geological phenomena; hydrothermal vent; moon; photosynthesis; phylogeny; time factor; Anaerobiosis; Biological Evolution; Biota; Geological Phenomena; Hydrothermal Vents; Minor Planets; Moon; Origin of Life; Photosynthesis; Phylogeny; Time Factors",Article,"",Scopus

Most of the available anticancer drugs are designed to act on specific targets by altering the activity of involved transporters and genes. As cancer cells exhibit complex cellular machinery, the regeneration of cancer tissues and chemo resistance towards the therapy has been the main obstacle in cancer treatment. This fact encourages the researchers to explore the multitargeted use of existing medicines to overcome the shortcomings of chemotherapy for alternative and safer treatment strategies. Recent developments in genomics-proteomics and an understanding of the molecular pharmacology of cancer have also challenged researchers to come up with target-based drugs. The literature supports the evidence of natural compounds exhibiting antioxidant, antimitotic, anti-inflammatory, antibiotic as well as anticancer activity. In this review, we have selected marine sponges as a prolific source of bioactive compounds which can be explored for their possible use in cancer and have tried to link their role in cancer pathway. To prove this, we revisited the literature for the selection of cancer genes for the multitargeted use of existing drugs and natural products. We used Cytoscape network analysis and Search tool for retrieval of interacting genes/ proteins (STRING) to study the possible interactions to show the links between the antioxidants, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory and antimitotic agents and their targets for their possible use in cancer. We included total 78 pathways, their genes and natural compounds from the above four pharmacological classes used in cancer treatment for multitargeted approach. Based on the Cytoscape network analysis results, we shortlist 22 genes based on their average shortest path length connecting one node to all other nodes in a network. These selected genes are CDKN2A, FH, VHL, STK11, SUFU, RB1, MEN1, HRPT2, EXT1, 2, CDK4, p14, p16, TSC1, 2, AXIN2, SDBH C, D, NF1, 2, BHD, PTCH, GPC3, CYLD and WT1. The selected genes were analysed using STRING for their protein-protein interactions. Based on the above findings, we propose the selected genes to be considered as major targets and are suggested to be studied for discovering marine natural products as drug lead in cancer treatment. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS","Anti-inflammatory agents; Antibiotics; Anticancer; Antimitotics; Antioxidants; Marine sponges; Multitargeted approach","antibiotic agent; antiinflammatory agent; antimitotic agent; antineoplastic agent; antioxidant; axin2 protein; BHD protein; cyclin dependent kinase 4; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A; EXT1 protein; EXT2 protein; FH protein; GPC3 protein; HRPT2 protein; MEN1 protein; natural product; NF1 protein; protein kinase LKB1; protein p14; protein p16; protein Patched; RB1 protein; SDBH protein; SUFU protein; TSC1 protein; tumor protein; ubiquitin carboxyl terminal hydrolase CYLD; unclassified drug; von Hippel Lindau protein; WT1 protein; biological product; Amphimedon; gene function; human; malignant neoplasm; marine species; molecularly targeted therapy; nonhuman; priority journal; protein protein interaction; Review; sponge (Porifera); symbiont; tumor gene; aquatic species; chemistry; drug delivery system; neoplasm; Aquatic Organisms; Biological Products; Drug Delivery Systems; Humans; Neoplasms",Review,"",Scopus

They are characterized by particular life history traits, such as a complex social structure and mating system involving sequential hermaphroditism, coupled with an exceptionally long lifespan. Additionally, clownfishes are considered to be one of the rare groups to have experienced an adaptive radiation in the marine environment. Here, we assembled and annotated the first genome of a clownfish species, the tomato clownfish (Amphiprion frenatus). We obtained 17,801 assembled scaffolds, containing a total of 26,917 genes. The completeness of the assembly and annotation was satisfying, with 96.5% of the Actinopterygii Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCOs) being retrieved in A. frenatus assembly. The quality of the resulting assembly is comparable to other bony fish assemblies. This resource is valuable for advancing studies of the particular life history traits of clownfishes, as well as being useful for population genetic studies and the development of new phylogenetic markers. It will also open the way to comparative genomics. Indeed, future genomic comparison among closely related fishes may provide means to identify genes related to the unique adaptations to different sea anemone hosts, as well as better characterize the genomic signatures of an adaptive radiation. © 2018 The Authors.

The data were further investigated with a focus on heat shock protein (HSP) gene families, with most characterized HSP genes present in our ESTs. In addition, the expression of HSP70 and HSP90 was significantly increased after T. suecica cells were exposed to metal contaminants.

Placozoans arguably show the simplest animal morphology, which is identical among isolates collected worldwide, despite an apparently sizeable genetic diversity within the phylum. Here, we use a comparative genomics approach for a deeper appreciation of the structure and causes of the deeply diverging lineages in the Placozoa. We generated a high-quality draft genome of the genetic lineage H13 isolated from Hong Kong and compared it to the distantly related T. adhaerens. We uncovered substantial structural differences between the two genomes that point to a deep genomic separation and provide support that adaptation by gene duplication is likely a crucial mechanism in placozoan speciation. We further provide genetic evidence for reproductively isolated species and suggest a genus-level difference of H13 to T. adhaerens, justifying the designation of H13 as a new species, Hoilungia hongkongensis nov. gen., nov. spec., now the second described placozoan species and the first in a new genus.

How long does diversification take and how much of the genome is affected? When divergence occurs in parallel from standing genetic variation, how often are the same haplotypes involved? We explore these questions using restriction site-associated DNA sequencing genotyping data and show that broad-scale genomic repatterning, fueled by copious standing variation, can emerge in just dozens of generations in replicate natural populations of threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus). After the catastrophic 1964 Alaskan earthquake, marine stickleback colonized newly created ponds on seismically uplifted islands. We find that freshwater fish in these young ponds differ from their marine ancestors across the same genomic segments previously shown to have diverged in much older lake populations. Outside of these core divergent regions the genome shows no population structure across the ocean–freshwater divide, consistent with strong local selection acting in alternative environments on stickleback populations still connected by significant gene flow. Reinforcing this inference, a majority of divergent haplotypes that are at high frequency in ponds are detectable in the sea, even across great geographic distances. Building upon previous population genomics work in this model species, our data suggest that a long history of divergent selection and gene flow among stickleback populations in oceanic and freshwater habitats has maintained polymorphisms of alternatively adapted DNA sequences that facilitate parallel evolution. © 2018 by the Genetics Society of America.","Contemporary evolution; Ecological divergence; Gasterosteus aculeatus; Population genomics; Threespine stickleback","Article; Gasterosteus aculeatus; gene flow; genetic variability; genome; haplotype; nonhuman; population genetics; population structure; priority journal; adaptation; Alaska; animal; DNA sequence; genetic selection; genetic variation; genetics; haplotype; molecular evolution; procedures; Smegmamorpha; Adaptation, Biological; Alaska; Animals; Evolution, Molecular; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Haplotypes; Selection, Genetic; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Smegmamorpha",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

To develop and implement measures that enhance species adaptive potential to cope with those pressures while, at the same time, ensuring sustainable exploitation rates is part of the central goal of fisheries management. Here, we argue that a combination of biophysical modelling and population genomic assessments offer ideal management tools to define stocks, their physical connectivity and ultimately, their short-term adaptive potential. To date, biophysical modelling has often been confined to fisheries ecology whereas evolutionary hypotheses remain rarely considered. When identified, connectivity patterns are seldom explored to understand the evolution and distribution of adaptive genetic variation, a proxy for species evolutionary potential. Here, we describe a framework that expands on the conventional seascape genetics approach by using biophysical modelling and population genomics. The goals are to identify connectivity patterns and selective pressures, as well as putative adaptive variants directly responding to the selective pressures and, ultimately, link both to define testable hypotheses over species response to shifting ecological conditions and overexploitation. © International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2018.

Most studies have focused on the isolation and characterization of strains from marine ecosystems as they present a higher microbial diversity than other sources. In this study, a marine bacterium, W5C, was isolated from red seaweed collected from Yeosu, South Korea. The isolate can utilize several natural polysaccharides such as agar, alginate, carrageenan, and chitin. Genome sequence and comparative genomics analyses suggest that strain W5C belongs to a novel species of the Cellulophaga genus, from which the name Cellulophaga omnivescoria sp. nov. is proposed. Its genome harbors 3,083 coding sequences and 146 carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes). Compared to other reported Cellulophaga species, the genome of W5C contained a higher proportion of CAZymes (4.7%). Polysaccharide utilization loci (PUL) for agar, alginate, and carrageenan were identified in the genome, along with other several putative PULs. These PULs are excellent sources for discovering novel hydrolytic enzymes and pathways with unique characteristics required for biorefinery applications, particularly in the utilization of marine renewable biomass.

However, their genomic information is limited, and the genomic data of only a few species of red algae have been sequenced and deposited recently. In this study, we annotated a draft genome of the macroalga Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis (Gracilariales, Rhodophyta). Results: The entire 88.98 Mb genome of Gp. lemaneiformis 981 was generated from 13,825 scaffolds (≥500 bp) with an N50 length of 30,590 bp, accounting for approximately 91% of this algal genome. A total of 38.73 Mb of scaffold sequences were repetitive, and 9281 protein-coding genes were predicted. A phylogenomic analysis of 20 genomes revealed the relationship among the Chromalveolata, Rhodophyta, Chlorophyta and higher plants. Homology analysis indicated phylogenetic proximity between Gp. lemaneiformis and Chondrus crispus. The number of enzymes related to the metabolism of carbohydrates, including agar, glycoside hydrolases, glycosyltransferases, was abundant.

Evolution toward GC-poor genomes has been considered a major adaptive pathway in the oligotrophic ocean, but GC-rich bacteria are also prevalent and highly successful in this environment. We quantify the contribution of multiple factors to the change of genomic GC content of Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS-3, a representative and GC-rich member in the globally abundant Roseobacter clade, using an agent-based model. The model simulates 2 × 108 cells, which allows random genetic drift to act in a realistic manner. Each cell has a whole genome subject to base-substitution mutation and recombination, which affect the carbon and nitrogen requirements of DNA and protein pools. Nonsynonymous changes can be functionally deleterious. Together, these factors affect the growth and fitness. Simulations show that experimentally determined mutation bias toward GC is not sufficient to build the GC-rich genome of DSS-3. While nitrogen availability has been repeatedly hypothesized to drive the evolution of GC content in marine bacterioplankton, our model instead predicts that DSS-3 and its ancestors have been evolving in environments primarily limited by carbon. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"ancestry; bacterium; cell; evolution; evolutionary biology; fitness; genetic drift; genome; genomics; growth; marine environment; mutation; oligotrophic environment; protein; Bacteria (microorganisms); Roseobacter; Ruegeria; bacterial DNA; carbon; nitrogen; bacterial genome; biological model; chemistry; DNA base composition; genetic drift; genetics; genomics; metabolism; molecular evolution; Rhodobacteraceae; Roseobacter; Base Composition; Carbon; DNA, Bacterial; Evolution, Molecular; Genetic Drift; Genome, Bacterial; Genomics; Models, Genetic; Nitrogen; Rhodobacteraceae; Roseobacter",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus

In this article, we present ways that genomic techniques might be used to further our understanding of cyanobacteria in cold environments in terms of their evolution and ecology. Existing examples from other environments (e.g. marine/hot springs) are used to discuss how methods developed there might be used to investigate specific questions in the cryosphere.

Under such scenarios, strong selection associated with spatial environmental heterogeneity is expected to drive localized adaptive divergence, even in the face of connectivity. We tested this hypothesis using a seascape genomics approach in the commercially important greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata). We assessed how its population structure has been influenced by environmental heterogeneity along a zonal coastal boundary in southern Australia linked by strong oceanographic connectivity. Our data sets include 9,109 filtered SNPs for 371 abalones from 13 localities and environmental mapping across ~800 km. Genotype–environment association analyses and outlier tests defined 8,786 putatively neutral and 323 candidate adaptive loci. From a neutral perspective, the species is better represented by a metapopulation with very low differentiation (global FST = 0.0081) and weak isolation by distance following a stepping-stone model. For the candidate adaptive loci, however, model-based and model-free approaches indicated five divergent population clusters. After controlling for spatial distance, the distribution of putatively adaptive variation was strongly correlated to selection linked to minimum sea surface temperature and oxygen concentration. Around 80 candidates were annotated to genes with functions related to high temperature and/or low oxygen tolerance, including genes that influence the resilience of abalone species found in other biogeographic regions.

Genomic signatures of local adaptation in marine organisms are often driven by environmental selective agents impacting the physiology of organisms. With one of the highest salinity level, the Mediterranean Sea provides an excellent model to investigate adaptive genomic divergence underlying salinity adaptation. In the present study, we combined six genome scan methods to detect potential genomic signal of selection in the striped red mullet (Mullus surmuletus) populations distributed across a wide salinity gradient. We then blasted these outlier sequences on published fish genomic resources in order to identify relevant potential candidate genes for salinity adaptation in this species. Results: Altogether, the six genome scan methods found 173 outliers out of 1153 SNPs. Using a blast approach, we discovered four candidate SNPs belonging to three genes potentially implicated in adaptation of M. surmuletus to salinity. The allele frequency at one of these SNPs significantly increases with salinity independently from the effect of longitude. The gene associated to this SNP, SOCS2, encodes for an inhibitor of cytokine and has previously been shown to be expressed under osmotic pressure in other marine organisms. Additionally, our results showed that genome scan methods not correcting for spatial structure can still be an efficient strategy to detect potential footprints of selection, when the spatial and environmental variation are confounded, and then, correcting for spatial structure in a second step represents a conservative method. Conclusion: The present outcomes bring evidences of potential genomic footprint of selection, which suggest an adaptive response of M. surmuletus to salinity conditions in the Mediterranean Sea. Additional genomic data such as sequencing of a full-genome and transcriptome analyses of gene expression would provide new insights regarding the possibility that some striped red mullet populations are locally adapted to their saline environment. © 2018 The Author(s).","Adaptive genomics; Candidate genes; Genome scan; Mediterranean Sea; Mullus surmuletus; Salinity","suppressor of cytokine signaling 2; adult; Article; fish; gene; gene expression; gene frequency; gene identification; gene ontology; gene sequence; genetic association; genetic procedures; genetic variability; genome scan; geographic distribution; habitual adaptation; Mediterranean Sea; nonhuman; osmotic pressure; population genetic structure; protein expression; salinity; salt tolerance; sea surface waters; single nucleotide polymorphism; SOCS2 gene; striped red mullet; transcriptomics; whole genome sequencing; adaptation; animal; genetics; genome; genomics; population genetics; procedures; salinity; Smegmamorpha; statistical analysis; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Genetics, Population; Genome; Genomics; Salinity; Smegmamorpha",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Due to the crucial role of copepods in marine food webs of transferring energy from primary producers to higher trophic levels, numerous studies have been conducted to examine the impacts of OA on biological traits of copepods such as growth and reproduction. Under OA stress, the copepods demonstrated species-specific and stage-dependent responses. Notably, different populations of the same copepod species demonstrated different sensitivities to the increased pCO2. In copepods, the deleterious effects of OA are also reinforced by other naturally occurring co-stressors (e.g., thermal stress, food deprivation, and metal pollution). Given that most OA stress studies have focused on the effects of short-term exposure (shorter than a single generation), experiments using adults might have underestimated the damaging effects of OA and the long-term multigenerational exposure to multiple stressors (e.g., increased pCO2 and food shortage) will be required. Particularly, omics-based technologies (e.g., genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) will be helpful to better understand the underlying processes behind biological responses (e.g., survival, development, and offspring production) at the mechanistic level which will improve our predictions of the responses of copepods to climate change stressors including OA. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Acclimatization/adaptation; Copepods; Long-term effects; Ocean acidification; Response","copper; mercury; carbon dioxide; metal; sea water; acclimation; climate change; crustacean; ecosystem response; environmental stress; marine ecosystem; ocean acidification; abiotic stress; Acartia bifilosa; Acartia erythraea; Acartia tonsa; Acartia tsuensis; acidification; adaptation; biomass; Calanus finmarchicus; Calanus glacialis; Centropages typicus; climate change; copepod; diet restriction; DNA methylation; energy transfer; epigenetics; food availability; food deprivation; histone modification; metabolomics; metal pollution; nonhuman; ocean acidification; Ophiothrix fragilis; pollution; priority journal; proteomics; Review; species difference; temperature acclimatization; temperature stress; Tigriopus japonicus; Tisbe battagliai; animal; chemistry; copepod; drug effects; ecosystem; food chain; greenhouse effect; growth, development and aging; pH; physiology; reproduction; temperature; toxicity; water pollutant; Copepoda; Animals; Carbon Dioxide; Copepoda; Ecosystem; Food Chain; Global Warming; Greenhouse Effect; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Metals; Reproduction; Seawater; Temperature; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Review,"",Scopus

The relationship between genome features and environmental adaptation strategies is an essential part for understanding the ecological functions of vibrios in the marine system. The advent of complete genome sequencing technology has provided an important method of examining the genetic characteristics of vibrios on the genomic level. Results: Two Vibrio genomes were sequenced and found to occupy many unique orthologues families which absent from the previously genes pool of the complete genomes of vibrios. Comparative genomics analysis found vibrios encompass a steady core-genome and tremendous pan-genome with substantial gene gain and horizontal gene transfer events in the evolutionary history. Evolutionary analysis based on the core-genome tree suggested that V. fischeri emerged ~385 million years ago, along with the occurrence of cephalopods and the flourish of fish. The relatively large genomes, the high number of 16S rRNA gene copies, and the presence of R-M systems and CRISPR system help vibrios live in various marine environments. Chitin-degrading related genes are carried in nearly all the Vibrio genomes. The number of chitinase genes in vibrios has been extremely expanded compared to which in the most recent ancestor of the genus. The chitinase A genes were estimated to have evolved along with the genus, and have undergone significant purifying selective force to conserve the ancestral state. Conclusions: Vibrios have experienced extremely genome expansion events during their evolutionary history, allowing them to develop various functions to spread globally. Despite their close phylogenetic relationships, vibrios were found to have a tremendous pan-genome with a steady core-genome, which indicates the highly plastic genome of the genus. Additionally, the existence of various chitin-degrading related genes and the expansion of chitinase A in the genus demonstrate the importance of the chitin utilization for vibrios. Defensive systems in the Vibrio genomes may protect them from the invasion of external DNA.

In this review, we summarize the state-of-the-art knowledge on various aspects of archaeal virus genomics. First, we outline how structural and functional genomics efforts provided valuable insights into the functions of viral proteins and revealed intricate details of the archaeal virus-host interactions. We then highlight recent metagenomics studies, which provided a glimpse at the diversity of uncultivated viruses associated with the ubiquitous archaea in the oceans, including Thaumarchaeota, Marine Group II Euryarchaeota, and others. These findings, combined with the recent discovery that archaeal viruses mediate a rapid turnover of thaumarchaea in the deep sea ecosystems, illuminate the prominent role of these viruses in the biosphere. Finally, we discuss the origins and evolution of archaeal viruses and emphasize the evolutionary relationships between viruses and non-viral mobile genetic elements.

To achieve its goals, SeaBioTech brings together leading experts in biology, genomics, natural product chemistry, bioactivity testing, industrial bioprocessing, legal aspects, market analysis and knowledge exchange. SeaBioTech targets novel marine endosymbiotic bacteria from unique and previously untapped habitats, including geothermal intertidal biotopes in Iceland, hydrothermal vent fields and deep-sea oligotrophic basins of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea and underexplored areas of Scottish coasts that are likely to be highly productive sources of new bioactive compounds. This chapter describes the 4 years of activity in the SeaBioTech project, which resulted in a robust, validated workflow suitable for evaluating unexplored activities in marine samples to prioritize potential products for a biotechnological pipeline. An improved integrated methodology involving metagenomics and metabolomics was extensively utilized to prioritize five extremophiles as potential antibiotics, anticancer drugs and novel drugs against metabolic diseases as well as new pharmaceutical excipients to the pipeline. A centralized biobank repository, which included a database of information, was established for future bioprospecting activities.

A 16S rRNA phylogeny of available Thermosipho spp. sequences suggested habitat specialists adapted to living in hydrothermal vents only, and habitat generalists inhabiting oil reservoirs, hydrothermal vents, and hotsprings. Comparative genomics of 15 Thermosipho genomes separated them into three distinct species with different habitat distributions: The widely distributed T. africanus and the more specialized, T. melanesiensis and T. affectus. Moreover, the species can be differentiated on the basis of genome size (GS), genome content, and immune system composition. For instance, the T. africanus genomes are largest and contained the most carbohydrate metabolism genes, which could explain why these isolates were obtained from ecologically more divergent habitats. Nonetheless, all the Thermosipho genomes, like other Thermotogae genomes, show evidence of genome streamlining. GS differences between the species could further be correlated to differences in defense capacities against foreign DNA, which influence recombination via HGT. The smallest genomes are found in T. affectus that contain both CRISPR-cas Type I and III systems, but no RM system genes. We suggest that this has caused these genomes to be almost devoid of mobile elements, contrasting the two other species genomes that contain a higher abundance of mobile elements combined with different immune system configurations. Taken together, the comparative genomic analyses of Thermosipho spp. revealed genetic variation allowing habitat differentiation within the genus as well as differentiation with respect to invading mobile DNA. © The Author(s) 2018.","Extremophiles; Hydrothermal vents; Mobile DNA; Speciation; Thermotogae 12","RNA 16S; bacterial genome; bacterium; comparative study; genetics; horizontal gene transfer; hydrothermal vent; immunology; microbiology; oil and gas field; phylogeny; Bacteria; Gene Transfer, Horizontal; Genome, Bacterial; Hydrothermal Vents; Oil and Gas Fields; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

A total of 9 candidate reference genes (HPRT, GAPDH, EF1A, TUBA, RPL7, RNAPol II, B2M, ACTB and 18S rRNA) were analyzed by qRT-PCR in 10 tissues (intestine, muscle, stomach, brain, heart, liver, gill, kidney, pectoral fins and spleen) of L. maculatus. Four algorithms, geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and comparative ΔCt method, were used to evaluate the expression stability of the candidate reference genes. The results showed the 18S rRNA was most stable in different tissues under normal conditions. During salinity stress, RPL7 was the most stable gene according to overall ranking and the best combination of reference genes was RPL7 and RNAPol II. In contrast, GAPDH was the least stable gene which was not suitable as reference genes. The study showed that different algorithms might generate inconsistent results. Therefore, the combination of several reference genes should be selected to accurately calibrate system errors. The present study was the first to select reference genes of L. maculatus by qRT-PCR and provides a useful basis for selecting the appropriate reference gene in L. maculatus. The present study also has important implications for gene expression and functional genomics research in this species or other teleost species.

As most plausible sister group of the vertebrates, they are of utmost importance for a comprehensive understanding of chordate evolution; hence, they have served as model organisms for many aspects of the developmental biology. Current genomic analysis of tunicates indicates that their genomes evolved with a fast rate not only at the level of nucleotide substitutions but also in terms of genomic organization. The latter involves genome reduction, rearrangements, as well as the loss of some important coding and noncoding RNA (ncRNAs) elements and even entire genomic regions that are otherwise well conserved. These observations are largely based on evidence from comparative genomics resulting from the analysis of well-studied gene families such as the Hox genes and their noncoding elements. In this chapter, the focus lies on the ncRNA complement of tunicates, with a particular emphasis on microRNAs, which have already been studied extensively for other animal clades. MicroRNAs are known as important regulators of key genes in animal development, and they are intimately related to the increase morphological complexity in higher metazoans. Here we review the discovery, evolution, and genome organization of the miRNA repertoire, which has been drastically reduced and restructured in tunicates compared to the chordate ancestor. Known functions of microRNAs as regulators of development in tunicates are a central topic. For instance, we consider the role of miRNAs as regulators of the muscle development and their importance in the regulation of the differential expression during the oral siphon regeneration. Beyond microRNAs, we touch upon the functions of some other ncRNAs such as yellow crescent RNA, moRNAs, RMST lncRNAs, or spliced-leader (SL) RNAs, which have diverse functions associated with the embryonic development, neurogenesis, and mediation of mRNA stability in general. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",,"long untranslated RNA; microRNA; untranslated RNA; animal; embryology; genetics; genome; metabolism; Urochordata; Animals; Genome; MicroRNAs; RNA, Long Noncoding; RNA, Untranslated; Urochordata",Book Chapter,"",Scopus

Phylogenetic analyses of this group of viruses, tentatively referred to as the family “Megaviridae”, suggest that it has an ancient origin that may predate the emergence of major eukaryotic lineages. Environmental genomics has since revealed that Megaviridae represents one of the most abundant and diverse groups of viruses in the ocean. In the present study, we compared the taxon richness and phylogenetic diversity of Megaviridae, Bacteria, and Archaea using DNA-dependent RNA polymerase as a common marker gene. By leveraging existing microbial metagenomic data, we found higher richness and phylogenetic diversity in this single viral family than in the two prokaryotic domains. We also obtained results showing that the evolutionary rate alone cannot account for the observed high diversity of Megaviridae lineages. These results suggest that the Megaviridae family has a deep co-evolutionary history with diverse marine protists since the early “Big-Bang” radiation of the eukaryotic tree of life. © 2018, Japanese Society of Microbial Ecology.

Here, we studied Pseudovibrio phylogeny and genetic adaptations that may play a role in host colonization by comparative genomics of 31 Pseudovibrio strains, including 25 sponge isolates. All genomes were highly similar in terms of encoded core metabolic pathways, albeit with substantial differences in overall gene content. Based on gene composition, Pseudovibrio spp. clustered by geographic region, indicating geographic speciation. Furthermore, the fact that isolates from the Mediterranean Sea clustered by sponge species suggested host-specific adaptation or colonization. Genome analyses suggest that Pseudovibrio hongkongensis UST20140214-015B T is only distantly related to other Pseudovibrio spp., thereby challenging its status as typical Pseudovibrio member. All Pseudovibrio genomes were found to encode numerous proteins with SEL1 and tetratricopeptide repeats, which have been suggested to play a role in host colonization. For evasion of the host immune system, Pseudovibrio spp. may depend on type III, IV, and VI secretion systems that can inject effector molecules into eukaryotic cells. Furthermore, Pseudovibrio genomes carry on average seven secondary metabolite biosynthesis clusters, reinforcing the role of Pseudovibrio spp. as potential producers of novel bioactive compounds. Tropodithietic acid, bacteriocin, and terpene biosynthesis clusters were highly conserved within the genus, suggesting an essential role in survival, for example through growth inhibition of bacterial competitors. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that Pseudovibrio spp. have mutualistic relations with sponges. © The Author(s) 2018.","Domainome; Microbiota; Phylogeny; Secondary metabolites; Sponge; Symbiosis","animal; antibiotic resistance; bacterial genome; genetics; genomics; microbiology; multigene family; physiology; quorum sensing; Rhodobacteraceae; secondary metabolism; sponge (Porifera); symbiosis; Animals; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Genome, Bacterial; Genomics; Multigene Family; Porifera; Quorum Sensing; Rhodobacteraceae; Secondary Metabolism; Symbiosis",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

In particular, marine biologists have taken advantage of technical development and are increasingly applying molecular techniques to address biological and ecological questions. Recently, the growing interest in marine and freshwater organisms expressed by private companies involved in pharmaceuticals, nutriceutics, and bioproduction have boosted interest and applications of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics. In parallel, molecular techniques like genetic transformation, genome modification, and gene silencing have been developed for nonmodel species. This improvement of molecular biology-related approach has enhanced academic research in biology, ecology and physiology of a plethora of metazoan nonmodel species. Copepods are the most species-rich class among the marine arthropods, are globally distributed and inhabit every environment from coastal to oceanic waters, where they represent the dominant group of zooplankton, and can also live as symbionts or parasites. This diverse array of life strategies and environments make copepods highly interesting as target species for genomic and transcriptomic studies. In the present contribution, we provide an overview of the state of the art about 'omics' studies in calanoid copepods, focusing on marine free-living species.

Cone snails, a group of more than 700 species, have always been one of the focuses for new drug discovery. These venomous snails capture prey using a diverse array of unique bioactive neurotoxins, usually named as conotoxins or conopeptides. These conotoxins have proven to be valuable pharmacological probes and potential drugs due to their high specificity and affinity to ion channels, receptors, and transporters in the nervous systems of target prey and humans. Several research groups, including ours, have examined the venom gland of cone snails using a combination of transcriptomic and proteomic sequencing, and revealed the existence of hundreds of conotoxin transcripts and thousands of conopeptides in each Conus species. Over 2000 nucleotide and 8000 peptide sequences of conotoxins have been published, and the number is still increasing quickly. However, more than 98% of these sequences still lack 3D structural and functional information. With the rapid development of genomics and bioinformatics in recent years, functional predictions and investigations on conotoxins are making great progress in promoting the discovery of novel drugs. For example, ω-MVIIA was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2004 to treat chronic pain, and nine more conotoxins are at various stages of preclinical or clinical evaluation. In short, the genus Conus, the big family of cone snails, has become an important genetic resource for conotoxin identification and drug development. © 2017 by the authors.","Cone snail; Conotoxin; Drug development; Proteome; Transcriptome","calmodulin; conotoxin; RNA 12S; RNA 16S; transcriptome; conotoxin; nicotinic receptor; nicotinic receptor alpha3beta4; protein binding; proteome; transcriptome; Alzheimer disease; amino acid sequence; biodiversity; biological activity; chronic pain; coastal waters; cone snail; drug development; functional proteomics; gene sequence; genetic transcription; genomics; human; mass spectrometry; mitochondrial genome; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Parkinson disease; phylogenetic tree; Protein Data Bank; protein processing; protein structure; Review; sequence analysis; snail; structural bioinformatics; structural proteomics; X ray crystallography; animal; chemistry; classification; Conus (snail); drug development; genetics; isolation and purification; metabolism; procedures; protein conformation; species difference; Animals; Conotoxins; Conus Snail; Drug Discovery; Humans; Protein Binding; Protein Conformation; Proteome; Receptors, Nicotinic; Species Specificity; Transcriptome",Review,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

ENMs are increasingly produced for various applications including cosmetics, electronics, sports equipment, biomedicine and agriculture. Because of their small size, ENMs possess chemical or physical characteristics improved compared to the corresponding macro-sized material. As their application expend, the release of manufactured ENMs into the environment is likely to increase and concern over impacts for the aquatic ecosystem is growing. Several studies reported deleterious effect of ENMs to aquatic organisms, but there is little information about the molecular mechanisms of toxicity. The development of ecotoxicogenomic approaches will improve the characterization of cellular and molecular modes of action of ENMs to aquatic organisms and allow a better prediction of contaminants toxicity. This paper presents an overview of transciptomic/proteomic studies in freshwater and marine organisms exposed to ENMs. Overall, induction of gene expression in relations to defense mechanisms, immune responses, growth and reproduction were measured after ENMs exposures of organisms, but with different patterns depending on exposure duration and concentrations used.

SSG-1, together with 76 previously sequenced strains, was comparatively studied. The results show that the pan-genome of Paenibacillus is open and indicate that the current taxonomy of this genus is incorrect. The incessant flux of gene repertoires resulting from the processes of gain and loss largely contributed to the difference in genomic content and genome size in Paenibacillus. Furthermore, a large number of genes gained are associated with carbohydrate transport and metabolism. It indicates that the evolution of glycometabolism is a key factor for the environmental adaptability of Paenibacillus species. Interestingly, through horizontal gene transfer, Paenibacillus sp. SSG-1 acquired an approximately 150 kb DNA fragment and shows an agar-degrading characteristic distinct from most other non-marine bacteria.

Here, we elucidated the significance of giant enteric symbionts colonizing these fishes regarding their roles in the digestive processes of hosts feeding predominantly on polysiphonous red algae and brown Turbinaria algae, which contain different polysaccharide constituents. Using metagenomics, single-cell genomics, and metatranscriptomic analyses, we provide evidence of metabolic diversification of enteric microbiota involved in the degradation of algal biomass in these fishes. The enteric microbiota is also phylogenetically and functionally simple relative to the complex lignocellulose-degrading microbiota of terrestrial herbivores. Over 90% of the enzymes for deconstructing algal polysaccharides emanate from members of a single bacterial lineage, “Candidatus Epulopiscium” and related giant bacteria. These symbionts lack cellulases but encode a distinctive and lineage-specific array of mostly intracellular carbohydrases concurrent with the unique and tractable dietary resources of their hosts. Importantly, enzymes initiating the breakdown of the abundant and complex algal polysaccharides also originate from these symbionts. These are also highly transcribed and peak according to the diel lifestyle of their host, further supporting their importance and host–symbiont cospeciation. Because of their distinctive genomic blueprint, we propose the classification of these giant bacteria into three candidate genera. Collectively, our findings show that the acquisition of metabolically distinct “Epulopiscium” symbionts in hosts feeding on compositionally varied algal diets is a key niche-partitioning driver in the nutritional ecology of herbivorous surgeonfishes. © 2017, National Academy of Sciences.

With a methodology specifically dedicated to ancient DNA and solid matrices, the authors were able to successfully extract and amplify DNA from marine shells spanning the last 7,000 years.

Here we ask if differences in the ecology and selection pressures between the Atlantic and Pacific are reflected in the diversity and genomic composition of their indigenous Prochlorococcus populations. We applied large-scale single-cell genomics and compared the cell-by-cell genomic composition of wild populations of co-occurring cells from samples from Station ALOHA off Hawaii, and from Bermuda Atlantic Time Series Station off Bermuda. We reveal fundamental differences in diversity and genomic structure of populations between the sites. The Pacific populations are more diverse than those in the Atlantic, composed of significantly more coexisting subpopulations and lacking dominant subpopulations. Prochlorococcus from the two sites seem to be composed of mostly non-overlapping distinct sets of subpopulations with different genomic backbones - likely reflecting different sets of ocean-specific micro-niches. Furthermore, phylogenetically closely related strains carry ocean-associated nutrient acquisition genes likely reflecting differences in major selection pressures between the oceans.

An analysis of 119 genome sequences representing three closely related species of the marine actinomycete genus Salinispora reveals extraordinary biosynthetic diversity in the form of 176 distinct biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) of which only 24 have been linked to their products. Remarkably, more than half of the BGCs were observed in only one or two strains, suggesting they were acquired relatively recently in the evolutionary history of the genus. These acquired gene clusters are concentrated in specific genomic islands, which represent hot spots for BGC acquisition. While most BGCs are stable in terms of their chromosomal position, others migrated to different locations or were exchanged with unrelated gene clusters suggesting a plug and play type model of evolution that provides a mechanism to test the relative fitness effects of specialized metabolites. Transcriptome analyses were used to address the relationships between BGC abundance, chromosomal position and product discovery. The results indicate that recently acquired BGCs can be functional and that complex evolutionary processes shape the micro-diversity of specialized metabolism observed in closely related environmental bacteria. © 2017 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"RNA 16S; aquatic species; bacterial genome; biosynthesis; classification; DNA sequence; gene expression profiling; genetics; genomic island; genomics; metabolism; microbiology; Micromonosporaceae; multigene family; nucleotide sequence; secondary metabolism; Aquatic Organisms; Base Sequence; Biosynthetic Pathways; Gene Expression Profiling; Genome, Bacterial; Genomic Islands; Genomics; Micromonosporaceae; Multigene Family; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Secondary Metabolism; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Water Microbiology",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

To prevent invasions and the impacts of invasions, a better understanding of species-specific invasion routes, establishment processes, demographic histories and range expansions is needed. Such valuable biological information can be obtained using population genomics approaches that allow fast and simultaneous screening of thousands of loci and SNP markers without prior knowledge of the genome of studied species. As a result, invasion genomics has the potential to reveal previously undetected population relationships, invasion routes and evolutionary patterns. Here, we characterized the genetic diversity, structure, temporal stability and putative footprints of selection in introduced Baltic Sea populations of the mud crab Rhithropanopeus harrisii using restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing. Similar to earlier mtDNA reports, analysis of 1013 SNPs revealed strong differentiation between the native and introduced populations. At a regional scale, clear evidence of population structuring was detected between Finnish and Estonian samples indicating that R. harrisii does not form a single panmictic population in the Baltic Sea. Clustering of samples according to the age groups (juvenile and adult) instead of geographical location within the Archipelago Sea revealed the presence of significant temporal variation at small spatial scale. Finally, we identified a number of outlier loci under temporal divergent selection between cohorts suggesting that contemporary selection in newly established areas may be stronger than selection associated with spatial heterogeneity within the Baltic Sea. These results demonstrate the utility of next-generation sequencing to increase understanding of the population diversity and structuring, and highlight the importance of temporal genetic analysis when dissecting fine-scale genetic structure for introduced marine species with high reproductive potential. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",,"Decapoda (Crustacea); Rhithropanopeus harrisii",Article,"",Scopus

Intersex is a condition whereby an individual of a gonochorist (separate sexes) species has oocytes or distinct stages of spermatogonia, at varying degrees of development, within the normal gonad of the opposite gender (i.e. spermatocytes in the ovary or oocytes in the testis), often involving alterations in the gonadal structure, reproductive tract or external genitalia. By the end of 2016 we found approximately 340 records of aquatic invertebrate species evidencing signs of intersexuality (or imposex), all comprised within the Phyla Mollusca and Arthropoda. Gastropod molluscs are by far the group with more examples documented (256 species), followed by crustaceans, i.e., decapods, copepods and amphipods. To our knowledge no further cases of intersexuality were known concerning other invertebrate taxa. Despite some reports suggesting that a baseline level of intersexuality may occur naturally in some populations, the causes are multifaceted and mostly linked with environmental contamination by estrogenic and organotin endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), parasitism, and genetic/environmental sex determination abnormalities. A more comprehensive discussion about the origin of intersexuality, prevalence and causes, knowledge gaps and future research directions in the light of new omics scientific advances (genomics, proteomics and transcriptomics) is also provided.

Microbes employ systems of complementary carbohydrate-specific enzymes to deconstruct algal or plant polysaccharides (glycans) into monosaccharides. Because of the high diversity of glycan substrates, the functions of these enzymes are often difficult to establish. One solution to this problem may lie within naturally occurring microdiversity; varying numbers of enzymes, due to gene loss, duplication, or transfer, among closely related environmental microbes create metabolic differences akin to those generated by knock-out strains engineered in the laboratory used to establish the functions of unknown genes. Inspired by this natural fine-scale microbial diversity, we show here that it can be used to develop hypotheses guiding biochemical experiments for establishing the role of these enzymes in nature. In this work, we investigated alginate degradation among closely related strains of the marine bacterium Vibrio splendidus. One strain, V. splendidus 13B01, exhibited high extracellular alginate lyase activity compared with other V. splendidus strains. To identify the enzymes responsible for this high extracellular activity, we compared V. splendidus 13B01 with the previously characterized V. splendidus 12B01, which has low extracellular activity and lacks two alginate lyase genes present in V. splendidus 13B01. Using a combination of genomics, proteomics, biochemical, and functional screening, we identified a polysaccharide lyase family 7 enzyme that is unique to V. splendidus 13B01, secreted, and responsible for the rapid digestion of extracellular alginate. © 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Bacteria; Enzymes; Genes; Molecular biology; Biochemical experiments; Environmental microbes; Extracellular activity; Functional screening; Microbial diversity; Naturally occurring; Plant polysaccharides; Polysaccharide degradation; Alginate; alginate lyase; alginic acid; bacterial enzyme; lyase; polysaccharide lyase; polysaccharide lyase family 7; unclassified drug; alginic acid; bacterial protein; biological marker; glucuronic acid; hexuronic acid; isoenzyme; poly(beta-D-mannuronate) lyase; polysaccharide lyase; recombinant protein; Article; bacterial gene; bacterial genetics; bacterial strain; biochemical analysis; controlled study; enzyme activity; enzyme release; genetic variation; genomics; marine bacterium; microbial degradation; microbial diversity; nonhuman; priority journal; protein function; proteomics; strain difference; Vibrio; Vibrio splendidus; aquatic species; chemical structure; chemistry; comparative study; enzyme specificity; enzymology; gene expression regulation; gene inactivation; genetics; growth, development and aging; hydrolysis; isolation and purification; metabolism; molecular weight; pH; phylogeny; physiology; procedures; secretion (process); species difference; X ray crystallography; Alginates; Aquatic Organisms; Bacterial Proteins; Biomarkers; Crystallography, X-Ray; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Gene Knockout Techniques; Genomics; Glucuronic Acid; Hexuronic Acids; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Hydrolysis; Isoenzymes; Molecular Structure; Molecular Weight; Phylogeny; Polysaccharide-Lyases; Proteomics; Recombinant Proteins; Species Specificity; Substrate Specificity; Vibrio",Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus

With recent advances in genomic sequencing, genome analysis, and analytical chemistry techniques, a whole host of information is being revealed about the primary and secondary metabolism of marine proteobacteria. This has led to the discovery of a growing number of medically relevant natural products, including novel leads for the treatment of multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and cancer. Of equal interest, marine proteobacteria produce natural products whose structure and biosynthetic mechanisms differ from those of their terrestrial and actinobacterial counterparts. Notable features of secondary metabolites produced by marine proteobacteria include halogenation, sulfur-containing heterocycles, non-ribosomal peptides, and polyketides with unusual biosynthetic logic. As advances are made in the technology associated with functional genomics, such as computational sequence analysis, targeted DNA manipulation, and heterologous expression, it has become easier to probe the mechanisms for natural product biosynthesis.

These results identify what may be a keystone organism within Trichodesmium consortia and support the idea that functional selection has a major role in structuring associated microbial communities.

Yet our understanding of their roles in ecosystems is limited by the paucity of model systems available for hypothesis generation and testing. Further, virology is limited by the lack of a broadly accepted conceptual framework to classify viral diversity into evolutionary and ecologically cohesive units. Here, we introduce genomes, structural proteomes, and quantitative host range data for eight Pseudoalteromonas phages isolated from Helgoland (North Sea, Germany) and use these data to advance a genome-based viral operational taxonomic unit (OTU) definition. These viruses represent five new genera and inform 498 unaffiliated or unannotated protein clusters (PCs) from global virus metagenomes. In a comparison of previously sequenced Pseudoalteromonas phage isolates (n = 7) and predicted prophages (n = 31), the eight phages are unique. They share a genus with only one other isolate, Pseudoalteromonas podophage RIO-1 (East Sea, South Korea) and two Pseudoalteromonas prophages. Mass-spectrometry of purified viral particles identified 12-20 structural proteins per phage. When combined with 3-D structural predictions, these data led to the functional characterization of five previously unidentified major capsid proteins. Protein functional predictions revealed mechanisms for hijacking host metabolism and resources. Further, they uncovered a hybrid sipho-myovirus that encodes genes for Mu-like infection rarely described in ocean systems. Finally, we used these data to evaluate a recently introduced definition for virus populations that requires members of the same population to have >95% average nucleotide identity across at least 80% of their genes. Using physiological traits and genomics, we proposed a conceptual model for a viral OTU definition that captures evolutionarily cohesive and ecologically distinct units. In this trait-based framework, sensitive hosts are considered viral niches, while host ranges and infection efficiencies are tracked as viral traits.

Here we apply single-virus genomics (SVGs) to assess whether portions of marine viral communities are missed by current techniques. The majority of the here-identified 44 viral single-amplified genomes (vSAGs) are more abundant in global ocean virome data sets than published metagenome-assembled viral genomes or isolates. This indicates that vSAGs likely best represent the dsDNA viral populations dominating the oceans. Species-specific recruitment patterns and virome simulation data suggest that vSAGs are highly microdiverse and that microdiversity hinders the metagenomic assembly, which could explain why their genomes have not been identified before. Altogether, SVGs enable the discovery of some of the likely most abundant and ecologically relevant marine viral species, such as vSAG 37-F6, which were overlooked by other methodologies. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"genome; genomics; marine environment; microbial community; microorganism; virus; gene amplification; metagenome; metagenomics; neurophysiological recruitment; sea; simulation; species; virus genome; Atlantic Ocean; biodiversity; data mining; flow cytometry; genetics; genomics; isolation and purification; Mediterranean Sea; procedures; proteomics; single nucleotide polymorphism; virology; virus; virus genome; sea water; Atlantic Ocean; Biodiversity; Data Mining; Flow Cytometry; Genome, Viral; Genomics; Mediterranean Sea; Metagenome; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Proteomics; Seawater; Viruses",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

But the revolution is not complete: major gaps in our understanding remain, and one obvious example is that microbial eukaryotes, or protists, are still largely neglected. Here we examine various ways in which protists might be better integrated into models of marine microbial ecology, what challenges this will present, and why understanding the limitations of our tools is a significant concern. In part this is a technical challenge — eukaryotic genomes are more difficult to characterize — but eukaryotic adaptations are also more dependent on morphology and behaviour than they are on the metabolic diversity that typifies bacteria, and these cannot be inferred from genomic data as readily as metabolism can be. We therefore cannot simply follow in the methodological footsteps of bacterial ecology and hope for similar success. Understanding microbial eukaryotes will require different approaches, including greater emphasis on taxonomically and trophically diverse model systems.

The aquaculture production of R. philippinarum is under threat from diverse environmental factors including viruses, microorganisms, parasites, and water conditions with subsequently declining production. In spite of its importance as a marine resource, the reference genome of R. philippinarum for comprehensive genetic studies is largely unexplored. Here, we report the de novo whole-genome and transcriptome assembly of R. philippinarum across three different tissues (foot, gill, and adductor muscle), and provide the basic data for advanced studies in selective breeding and disease control in order to obtain successful aquaculture systems. An approximately 2.56 Gb high quality whole-genome was assembled with various library construction methods. A total of 108,034 protein coding gene models were predicted and repetitive elements including simple sequence repeats and noncoding RNAs were identified to further understanding of the genetic background of R. philippinarum for genomics-assisted breeding. Comparative analysis with the bivalve marine invertebrates uncover that the gene family related to complement C1q was enriched. Furthermore, we performed transcriptome analysis with three different tissues in order to support genome annotation and then identified 41,275 transcripts which were annotated. The R. philippinarum genome resource will markedly advance a wide range of potential genetic studies, a reference genome for comparative analysis of bivalve species and unraveling mechanisms of biological processes in molluscs.

Until recently natural product chemistry was the primary investigative approach to elucidate the nature of chemical signals but advances in genomics and transcriptomics over the last decade have facilitated breakthroughs in understanding not only the chemistry but also the molecular mechanisms underpinning chemosensation in aquatic environments. Integration of these approaches has the potential to reveal the fundamental elements influencing community structure of benthic ecosystems as chemical signalling modulates intra- and inter-species interactions. Such knowledge also offers avenues for potential development of novel biological control methods for pest species such as the predatory Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS), Acanthaster planci which are the primary biological cause of coral cover loss in the Indo-Pacific. Results: In this study, we have analysed the COTS sensory organs through histological and electron microscopy. We then investigated key elements of the COTS molecular olfactory toolkit, the putative olfactory rhodopsin-like G protein-protein receptors (GPCRs) within its genome and olfactory organ transcriptomes. Many of the identified Acanthaster planci olfactory receptors (ApORs) genes were found to cluster within the COTS genome, indicating rapid evolution and replication from an ancestral olfactory GPCR sequence. Tube feet and terminal sensory tentacles contain the highest proportion of ApORs. In situ hybridisation confirmed the presence of four ApORs, ApOR15, 18, 25 and 43 within COTS sensory organs, however expression of these genes was not specific to the adhesive epidermis, but also within the nerve plexus of tube feet stems and within the myomesothelium. G alpha subunit proteins were also identified in the sensory organs, and we report the spatial localisation of Gαi within the tube foot and sensory tentacle. Conclusions: We have identified putative COTS olfactory receptors that localise to sensory organs. These results provide a basis for future studies that may enable the development of a biological control not only for COTS, but also other native pest or invasive starfish. © 2017 The Author(s).","COTS; GPCR; In situ hybridisation; Olfaction; Starfish","G protein coupled receptor; G protein coupled receptor; Acanthaster planci; amino acid sequence; ApOR15 gene; ApOR18 gene; ApOR25 gene; ApOR43 gene; Article; controlled study; electron microscopy; epidermis; gene; histology; in situ hybridization; microscopy; nerve plexus; nonhuman; olfactory receptor gene; protein determination; protein localization; protein structure; sensory system; sequence analysis; starfish; animal; chemistry; gene expression profiling; genetics; genomics; odor; physiology; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Gene Expression Profiling; Genomics; Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled; Smell; Starfish",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

So far, species capable of performing (bacterio)chlorophyll-based phototrophy have been reported in seven bacterial phyla, i.e., Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria, Chlorobi, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, Acidobacteria, and Gemmatimonadetes. Here we review the discovery, physiology, genomic characteristics, environmental distribution, and possible evolutionary origin of the bacterium Gemmatimonas phototrophica strain AP64, so far the only phototrophic member of the phylum Gemmatimonadetes. This organism was isolated from a freshwater lake in the Gobi Desert, North China in 2011. It contains fully functional type-2 photosynthetic reaction centers, but they seem to only serve as an auxiliary energy source. Its photosynthesis genes are located in a 42.3 kb long photosynthesis gene cluster which appear to originate from an ancient horizontal gene transfer from a purple phototrophic bacterium. A survey of biomarker genes of phototrophic Gemmatimonadetes bacteria (PGB) in public environmental genomics databases suggests that PGB are widely distributed in diverse environments, including air, river waters/sediment, estuarine waters, lake waters, biofilms, plant surfaces, intertidal sediments, soils, springs, and wastewater treatment plants, but none from marine waters or sediment. PGB make up roughly 0.4-11.9 % of whole phototrophic microbial communities in these habitats. The discovery of PGB presents a strong evidence that genes for anoxygenic phototrophy can be transferred between distant bacterial phyla, providing new insights into the evolution of bacterial photosynthesis. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.

In this study, we explored connectivity patterns of a marine species with long-distance dispersal, the edible common sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus, focusing mainly on the Adriatic–Ionian basins (Central Mediterranean). We applied a multidisciplinary approach integrating population genomics, based on 1,122 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) obtained from 2b-RAD in 275 samples, with Lagrangian simulations performed with a biophysical model of larval dispersal. We detected genetic homogeneity among eight population samples collected in the focal Adriatic–Ionian area, whereas weak but significant differentiation was found with respect to two samples from the Western Mediterranean (France and Tunisia). This result was not affected by the few putative outlier loci identified in our dataset. Lagrangian simulations found a significant potential for larval exchange among the eight Adriatic–Ionian locations, supporting the hypothesis of connectivity of P. lividus populations in this area. A peculiar pattern emerged from the comparison of our results with those obtained from published P. lividus cytochrome b (cytb) sequences, the latter revealing genetic differentiation in the same geographic area despite a smaller sample size and a lower power to detect differences.

However, preliminary genomic analysis has suggested that genome-guided approaches can enable the discovery of novel compounds from even well-studied Moorea strains, highlighting the importance of obtaining complete genomes. We report a complete genome of a filamentous tropical marine cyanobacterium, Moorea producens PAL, which reveals that about one-fifth of its genome is devoted to production of secondary metabolites, an impressive four times the cyanobacterial average. Moreover, possession of the complete PAL genome has allowed improvement to the assembly of three other Moorea draft genomes. Comparative genomics revealed that they are remarkably similar to one another, despite their differences in geography,morphology, and secondary metabolite profiles. Gene cluster networking highlights that this genus is distinctive among cyanobacteria, not only in the number of secondary metabolite pathways but also in the content of many pathways, which are potentially distinct from all other bacterial gene clusters to date.

Here, we constructed an oyster 190K SNP array using Affymetrix Axiom genotyping technology. We designed 190,420 SNPs on the chip; these SNPs were selected from 54 million SNPs identified through re-sequencing of 472 Pacific oysters collected in China, Japan, Korea, and Canada. Our genotyping results indicated that 133,984 (70.4%) SNPs were polymorphic and successfully converted on the chip. The SNPs were distributed evenly throughout the oyster genome, located in 3,595 scaffolds with a length of [[amp]]sim;509.4 million; the average interval spacing was 4,210 bp. In addition, 111,158 SNPs were distributed in 21,050 coding genes, with an average of 5.3 SNPs per gene. In comparison with genotypes obtained through re-sequencing, [[amp]]sim;69% of the converted SNPs had a concordance rate of >0.971; the mean concordance rate was 0.966. Evaluation based on genotypes of full-sib family individuals revealed that the average genotyping accuracy rate was 0.975. Carrying 133 K polymorphic SNPs, our oyster 190K SNP array is the first commercially available high-density SNP chip for mollusks, with the highest throughput.

Microalgae may also have to adapt to physical alterations that induce the loss of connectivity between habitats and the enclosure of bodies of water. Here, we integrated physiological assays and measurements of morphological plasticity with a functional genomics approach to examine the regulatory changes that occur during the acclimation to salinity in the estuarine diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii. We found that cells exposed to different salinity regimes for a short or long period presented adjustments in their carbon fractions, silicon pools, pigment concentrations and/or photosynthetic parameters. Salinity-induced alterations in frustule symmetry were observed only in the long-term (LT) cultures. Whole transcriptome analyses revealed a down-regulation of nuclear and plastid encoded genes during the LT response and identified only a few regulated genes that were in common between the ST and LT responses. We propose that in diatoms, one strategy for acclimating to salinity gradients and maintaining optimal cellular fitness could be a reduction in the cost of transcription. © 2016 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"carbon; sea water; silicon; transcriptome; acclimatization; diatom; down regulation; estuary; genetics; photosynthesis; physiology; salinity; Acclimatization; Carbon; Diatoms; Down-Regulation; Estuaries; Photosynthesis; Salinity; Seawater; Silicon; Transcriptome",Article,"",Scopus

The genome of MP131-18 isolate was sequenced, and 36 gene clusters involved in the biosynthesis of 18 different types of secondary metabolites were predicted using antiSMASH analysis. The combined genomics-metabolics profiling of the strain led to the identification of several new biologically active compounds. As a result, the family of bisindole pyrroles spiroindimicins was extended with two new members, spiroindimicins E and F. Furthermore, prediction of the biosynthetic pathway for unusual α-pyrone lagunapyrone isolated from MP131-18 resulted in foresight and identification of two new compounds of this family - lagunapyrones D and E.

The MAST-4 lineage is of particular interest, since it is widespread in surface oceans, presents ecotypic differentiation and has defied culturing efforts so far. Single cell genomics (SCG) are promising tools to retrieve genomic information from these uncultured organisms. However, SCG are based on whole genome amplification, which normally introduces amplification biases that limit the amount of genomic data retrieved from a single cell. Here, we increase the recovery of genomic information from two MAST-4 lineages by co-assembling short reads from multiple Single Amplified Genomes (SAGs) belonging to evolutionary closely related cells. We found that complementary genomic information is retrieved from different SAGs, generating co-assembly that features >74% of genome recovery, against about 20% when assembled individually. Even though this approach is not aimed at generating high-quality draft genomes, it allows accessing to the genomic information of microbes that would otherwise remain unreachable.

Functional genomics has made significant advances in decoding functionality of gene(s) and their regulations furthering our knowledge of systems biology of an organism. The true benefits of such studies have widely been realized in terrestrial plants by understanding their bio-architecture, physiology, regulation and metabolic activations. The functional genomics studies for marine macroalgae (seaweeds) are underdetermined despite their proven economic value. Seaweeds are generally found growing in the intertidal region and experience diverse chronic stresses, including the desiccation, intense irradiance, ultraviolet radiation, salinity and submergence/exposure arising from periodic regular tidal rhythms. The molecular basis of genetic regulations involved in physiological adaptation of seaweeds is limited. The whole genome sequences available for Ectocarpus siliculosus and Chondrus crispus remained largely functionally unannotated. On the other hand, the seaweed improvement programmes also retarded due to limitation of mapping of functional traits over genetic loci. So far, only a few verities were developed using time-consuming conventional breeding approach. The advancement in functional genomics in seaweeds can significantly contribute to these gap areas. Moreover, the functional genomics will facilitate decoding of the mechanisms regulating biosynthesis of species-specific valuable products. This will support the genetic manipulation research for improvements of desired traits in seaweeds. This review, therefore, highlights the potentials of functional genomics in understanding and resolving the unexplored facts about seaweed physiology and trait characterization for developing strategies towards crop improvement. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Genomics; Metabolomics; Seaweed; Systems biology; Transcriptome",,Book Chapter,"",Scopus

With simple growth requirements (light, CO2, N, P and K), microalgae produce various valuable products like carotenoids, antioxidants, fatty acids, enzymes, polymers, peptides, toxins and sterols. Their photosynthetic mechanism is similar to plants, but due to their simple cellular structure and submergence in an aqueous environment, in most cases, they have an efficient access to water, CO2 and other nutrients. In addition, their growth is faster and photosynthetic efficiency is higher compared to terrestrial crop plants. Their shorter generation time allows production of lipids and carbohydrates in large amounts over short periods of time, which can be easily converted into biofuels. Due to these reasons, microalgae are considered as an alternative renewable feedstock for biofuel production. In any organism, fluctuating environmental conditions trigger a series of physiological processes and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which are highly reactive and damage proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and DNA, ultimately resulting into cellular toxicity. Stress-induced ROS accumulation is counteracted by cellular enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants. Excessive ROS damage the ability of the cells to readily detoxify the reactive intermediates or to repair the resulting damage, ultimately leading to oxidative stress conditions. Recent studies suggest that oxidative stress is a mediator for increased accumulation of lipid and various bioactive metabolites in microalgae. This chapter provides comprehensive information on bioprospecting of microalgae under oxidative stress conditions, mainly for their carotenoid accumulation and biofuel potential.

In fish, visual pigment genes are often independently duplicated, and the evolutionary significance of such duplications has long been of interest. Eels have two rhodopsin genes (rho), one of which (freshwater type, fw-rho) functions in freshwater and the other (deep-sea type, ds-rho) in marine environments. Hence, switching of rho expression in retinal cells is tightly linked with eels' unique life cycle, in which they migrate from rivers or lakes to the sea. These rho genes are apparently paralogous, but the timing of their duplication is unclear due to the deep-branching phylogeny. The aim of the present study is to elucidate the evolutionary origin of the two rho copies in eels using comparative genomics methods. Results In the present study, we sequenced the genome of Japanese eel Anguilla japonica and reconstructed two regions containing rho by de novo assembly. We found a single corresponding region in a non-teleostean primitive ray-finned fish (spotted gar) and two regions in a primitive teleost (Asian arowana). The order of ds-rho and the neighboring genes was highly conserved among the three species. With respect to fw-rho, which was lost in Asian arowana, the neighboring genes were also syntenic between Japanese eel and Asian arowana. In particular, the pattern of gene losses in ds-rho and fw-rho regions was the same as that in Asian arowana, and no discrepancy was found in any of the teleost genomes examined. Phylogenetic analysis supports mutual monophyly of these two teleostean synteny groups, which correspond to the ds-rho and fw-rho regions. Conclusions Syntenic and phylogenetic analyses suggest that the duplication of rhodopsin gene in Japanese eel predated the divergence of eel (Elopomorpha) and arowana (Osteoglossomorpha). Thus, based on the principle of parsimony, it is most likely that the rhodopsin paralogs were generated through a whole genome duplication in the ancestor of teleosts, and have remained till the present in eels with distinct functional roles. Our result indicates, for the first time, that teleost-specific genome duplication may have contributed to a gene innovation involved in eel-specific migratory life cycle. © 2017, The Author(s).","Anguilla; Gene loss; Phylogenomics; Rhodopsin paralogs; Synteny; Teleostei; Visual adaptation; Whole genome duplication",,Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

High-throughput sequencing, which is considered as one of the most important tools in genomics research, is widely applied in the field of marine nanophytoplankton and picophytoplankton diversity studies. We successfully obtained a pair of nanophytoplankton and picophytoplankton PCR primers V4(F/R) by analyzing the nucleic acid database and using a series of bioinformatics tools. Two pairs of universal primers were also selected for comparative analysis, which amplified variable region V4 and V9 of the small subunit nuclear ribosomal DNA (SSU nrDNA).The sensitivity and specificity of PCR primers V4(F/R), V9(F/R), and C4(F/R) were also evaluated and compared using online bioinformatics software. The results showed that the amplification specificity of primer pair V4(F/R) was better than that of V9(F/R) and C4(F/R) in eukaryotic algae. High-throughput sequencing results showed that 68834 raw tags were amplified by the primers, 99% of which were effective tags. Sequences of more than 94% of the effective tags were identified by Ribosomal Database Project Classifier, among which 308 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of one sample were used for further analysis. The average numbers of nanophytoplankton and picophytoplankton OTUs amplified by V4(F/R), V9(F/R), and C4(F/R), were 78, 42, 58, respectively. The primer pair V4(F/R) was found to have higher sensitivity and specificity for amplifying nanophytoplankton and picophytoplankton, including Micromonas pusilla, Ostreococcus tauri, Pycnococcus provasolii, Aureococcus anophagefferens, and Heterosigma akashiwo. The V4 region from the environmental eukaryotic 18S rDNA gene could be suitable for high-throughput sequencing technology, and it was also a good target gene formarine nanophytoplankton and picophytoplankton identification.

Photobacterium is the second largest genus in the family and we used comparative genomics on 35 strains representing 16 of the 28 species described so far, to understand the genomic diversity present in the Photobacterium genus. Such understanding is important for ecophysiology studies of the genus. We used whole genome sequences to evaluate phylogenetic relationships using several analyses (16S rRNA, MLSA, fur, amino-acid usage, ANI), which allowed us to identify two misidentified strains. Genome analyses also revealed occurrence of higher and lower GC content clades, correlating with phylogenetic clusters. Pan- and core-genome analysis revealed the conservation of 25% of the genome throughout the genus, with a large and open pan-genome. The major source of genomic diversity could be traced to the smaller chromosome and plasmids. Several of the physiological traits studied in the genus did not correlate with phylogenetic data. Since horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is often suggested as a source of genetic diversity and a potential driver of genomic evolution in bacterial species, we looked into evidence of such in Photobacterium genomes. Genomic islands were the source of genomic differences between strains of the same species. Also, we found transposase genes and CRISPR arrays that suggest multiple encounters with foreign DNA. Presence of genomic exchange traits was widespread and abundant in the genus, suggesting a role in genomic evolution. The high genetic variability and indications of genetic exchange make it difficult to elucidate genome evolutionary paths and raise the awareness of the roles of foreign DNA in the genomic evolution of environmental organisms. © 2017 Machado and Gram.","Comparative genomics; Core-genome; Pan-genome; Photobacterium; Vibrionaceae","Article; bacteriophage; bioluminescence; biosynthesis; clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat; gene cluster; gene sequence; gene transfer; genetic variability; genome analysis; phenotype; Photobacterium; phylogeny",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Animal and plant ecologists have advanced substantially our understanding of ecological inter - actions. In contrast, our knowledge of ecological interaction in microbes is still rudimentary. This represents a major knowledge gap, as microbes are key players in almost all ecosystems, particularly in the oceans. Several studies still pool together widely different marine microbes into broad functional categories (e.g. grazers) and therefore overlook fine-grained species/population-specific interactions. Increasing our understanding of ecological interactions is particularly needed for oceanic microeukaryotes, which include a large diversity of poorly understood symbiotic relationships that range from mutualistic to parasitic. The reason for the current state of affairs is that determining ecological interactions between microbes has proven to be highly challenging. However, recent technological developments in genomics and transcriptomics (metaomics for short), coupled with microfluidics and high-performance computing are making it increasingly feasible to determine ecological interactions at the microscale.

However, the taxonomy and phylogeny of this genus are not completely elucidated; for example, P. logei and P. fischeri are now considered members of the genus Aliivibrio, and previously were included in the genus Vibrio. In addition, P. damselae subsp. piscicida was formed as a new combination for former Vibrio damsela and Pasteurella piscicida. Moreover, P. damselae subsp. damselae is an earlier heterotypic synonym of P. histaminum. To avoid these incovenences draft and complete genomic sequences of members of Photobacterium are increasingly becoming available and their use is now routine for many research laboratories to address diverse goals: species delineation with overall genomic indexes, phylogenetic analyses, comparative genomics, and phenotypic inference. The habitats and isolation source of the Photobacterium species include seawater, sea sediments, saline lake waters, and a variety of marine organisms with which the photo-bacteria establish different relationships, from symbiosis to pathogenic interactions. Several species of this genus contain bioluminescent strains in symbiosis with marine fish and cephalopods; in addition, other species enhance its growth at pressures above 1 atmosphere, by means of several high-pressure adaptation mechanisms and for this, they may be considered as piezophilic (former barophilic) bacteria. Until now, only P. jeanii, P. rosenbergii, P. sanctipauli, and the two subspecies of P. damselae have been reported as responsible agents of several pathologies on animal hosts, such as corals, sponges, fish and homeothermic animals.

To date, these marine studies have predominantly focused on rudimentary metrics describing the spatial and environmental context of their study region (e.g., geographical distance, average sea surface temperature, average salinity). We contend that a more nuanced and considered approach to quantifying seascape dynamics and patterns can strengthen population genomic investigations and help identify spatial, temporal, and environmental factors associated with differing selective regimes or demographic histories. Nevertheless, approaches for quantifying marine landscapes are complicated. Characteristic features of the marine environment, including pelagic living in flowing water (experienced by most marine taxa at some point in their life cycle), require a well-designed spatial-temporal sampling strategy and analysis. Many genetic summary statistics used to describe populations may be inappropriate for marine species with large population sizes, large species ranges, stochastic recruitment, and asymmetrical gene flow. Finally, statistical approaches for testing associations between seascapes and population genomic patterns are still maturing with no single approach able to capture all relevant considerations. None of these issues are completely unique to marine systems and therefore similar issues and solutions will be shared for many organisms regardless of habitat. Here, we outline goals and spatial approaches for landscape genomics with an emphasis onmarine systems and review the growing empirical literature on seascape genomics. We review established tools and approaches and highlight promising new strategies to overcome select issues including a strategy to spatially optimize sampling. Despite the many challenges, we argue that marine systems may be especially well suited for identifying candidate genomic regions under environmentally mediated selection and that seascape genomic approaches are especially useful for identifying robust locus-by-environment associations. © The Author (2016).","Adaptation; Genetic-environment association; Landscape; Oceanography; Population genomics; Remote sensing; Seascape genetics",,Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

A notable feature of the CFP is its legally enshrined requirement for sound scientific advice to underpin its objectives. The CFP was first conceived in 1970 when it formed part of the Common Agricultural Policy. Its formal inception as a stand-alone regulation occurred in 1983 and since that time, the CFP has undergone reforms in 1992, 2002 and 2013, each time bringing additional challenges to the scientific advisory process as the scope of the advice increased in response to changing objectives arising from E.U. regulations and commitments to international agreements. This paper reviews the influence that genetics has had on fish stock assessments and the provision of management advice for European fisheries under successive reforms of the CFP. The developments in genetics since the inception of the CFP have given rise to a diverse and versatile set of genetic techniques that have the potential to provide significant added value to fisheries assessments and the scientific advisory process. While in some cases, notably Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp., genetics appear to be very well integrated into existing management schemes, it seems that for marine fishes, discussions on the use of genetics and genomics for fisheries management are often driven by the remarkable technological progress in this field, rather than imminent needs emerging from policy frameworks. An example is the recent suggestion to use environmental (e)DNA for monitoring purposes. While there is no denying that state-of-the-art genetic and genomic approaches can and will be of value to address a number of issues relevant for the management and conservation of marine renewable natural resources, a focus on technology rather than policy and management needs is prone to widen the gap between science and policy, governance and management, thereby further impeding the effective integration of genetic and genomic information into the fisheries management decision making process. Hence, rather than focusing on what is technically achievable, this review outlines suggestions as to which modern genetic and genomic approaches are likely to help address some of the most pressing fisheries management challenges under the CFP. © 2016 The Authors.

Though discovered over a decade ago [2, 3], their potential importance was unrecognized, and our knowledge remains restricted to a single gene amplified from environmental DNA, the 18S rRNA gene (small subunit [SSU]). Here, we use single-cell genomics (SCG) and microscopy to characterize ten marine diplonemids, isolated from a range of depths in the eastern North Pacific Ocean. Phylogenetic analysis confirms that the isolates reflect the entire range of marine diplonemid diversity, and comparisons to environmental SSU surveys show that sequences from the isolates range from rare to superabundant, including the single most common marine diplonemid known. SCG generated a total of ∼915 Mbp of assembled sequence across all ten cells and ∼4,000 protein-coding genes with homologs in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) orthology database, distributed across categories expected for heterotrophic protists. Models of highly conserved genes indicate a high density of non-canonical introns, lacking conventional GT-AG splice sites. Mapping metagenomic datasets [4] to SCG assemblies reveals virtually no overlap, suggesting that nuclear genomic diversity is too great for representative SCG data to provide meaningful phylogenetic context to metagenomic datasets. This work provides an entry point to the future identification, isolation, and cultivation of these elusive yet ecologically important cells. The high density of nonconventional introns, however, also portends difficulty in generating accurate gene models and highlights the need for the establishment of stable cultures and transcriptomic analyses. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","diplonemid; ecology; evolution; heterotroph; marine microbiology; protist","protozoal RNA; amino acid sequence; biodiversity; California; classification; cytology; Euglenozoa; genetics; genome; metagenomics; Pacific Ocean; phylogeny; plankton; sequence alignment; Amino Acid Sequence; Biodiversity; California; Euglenozoa; Genome, Protozoan; Metagenomics; Pacific Ocean; Phylogeny; Plankton; RNA, Protozoan; Sequence Alignment",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus

One group of non-traditional venomous organisms that have benefitted from the rise of -omic technologies is the Conoideans. The Conoidean superfamily of venomous marine snails includes, the Terebridae, Turridae (s.l), and Conidae. Conoidea venom is used for both predation and defense, and therefore under strong selection pressures. The need for conoidean venom peptides to be potent and specific to their molecular targets has made them important tools for investigating cellular physiology and bioactive compounds that are beneficial to improving human health. A convincing case for the potential of Conoidean venom is made with the first commercially available conoidean venom peptide drug Ziconotide (Prialt®), an analgesic derived from Conus magus venom that is used to treat chronic pain in HIV and cancer patients.

Much effort has been made to identify viable and ecologically relevant invertebrate test organisms to meet rigorous regulatory requirements. Copepods, which are ecologically important and widely distributed in aquatic organisms, offer a huge opportunity as test organisms for aquatic toxicity testing. They have a major role not only in the transfer of energy in aquatic food chains, but also as a medium of transfer of aquatic pollutants across the tropic levels. In this regard, a supratidal and benthic harpacticoid copepod Tigriopus japonicus Mori (order Harpacticoida) has shown promising characteristics as a test organism in the field of ecotoxicology. Because there is a need to standardize a battery of test organisms from species in different phylogenetic and critical ecosystem positions, it is important to identify another unrelated planktonic species for wider application and comparison. In this regard, the cyclopoid copepod Paracyclopina nana Smirnov (order Cyclopoida) has emerged as a potential test organism to meet such requirements. Like T. japonicus, it has a number of features that make it a candidate worth consideration in such efforts. Recently, the genomics of P. nana has been unraveled. Data on biochemical and molecular responses of P. nana against exposure to environmental chemicals and other stressors have been collected. Recently, sequences and expression profiles of a number of genes in P. nana encoding for heat shock proteins, xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes, and antioxidants have been reported. These genes serve as potential biomarkers in biomonitoring of environmental pollutants. Moreover, the application of gene expression techniques and the use of its whole transcriptome have allowed evaluation of transcriptional changes in P. nana with the ultimate aim of understanding the mechanisms of action of environmental stressors. Whole-animal bioassays and gene expression studies indicate that P. nana may serve as an excellent tool to evaluate the impact of diverse disturbances in the marine environment. With a better understanding of toxicological mechanisms, ecotoxicologists will be able to understand defense mechanisms against toxicants in copepods. In this review, we illustrate the potential of P. nana as an alternative as well as a complementary invertebrate model organism for risk assessment of aquatic pollutants. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Aquatic pollution; Bioassay; Biomarker; Copepod; Environmental OMICS approaches; Gene expression; Monitoring","arsenic; atrazine; biological marker; cadmium; carbofuran; copper; dichlorvos; diethylstilbestrol; diflubenzuron; ecdysterone; estradiol; ethinylestradiol; fenarimol; fipronil; flame retardant; malathion; mercury; methyltestosterone; microcystin; musk; nickel; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; polyvinylchloride; reactive oxygen metabolite; silver; tetrabromobisphenol A; zinc; antioxidant; biological marker; transcriptome; water pollutant; bioassay; biochemistry; biomarker; biomonitoring; crustacean; defense mechanism; ecotoxicology; environmental impact assessment; genomics; molecular analysis; phylogenetics; risk assessment; toxicity test; water pollution; aquatic environment; bioassay; biological monitoring; copepod; ecotoxicity; environmental stress; gamma radiation; gene expression; genetic transcription; genome; invertebrate model; nonhuman; Paracyclopina nana; priority journal; Review; RNA sequence; toxicity testing; ultraviolet radiation; water pollution; animal; animal model; copepod; drug effects; ecotoxicology; environmental monitoring; genetics; genomics; metabolism; procedures; toxicity; toxicity testing; water pollutant; Animalia; Copepoda; Cyclopoida; Harpacticoida; Invertebrata; Tigriopus japonicus; Animals; Antioxidants; Biological Assay; Biomarkers; Copepoda; Ecotoxicology; Environmental Monitoring; Genomics; Models, Animal; Toxicity Tests; Transcriptome; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Review,"",Scopus

Genomic studies of NMOs utilize an expanding range of approaches, including whole genome sequencing, restriction site-associated DNA sequencing, array-based sequencing of single nucleotide polymorphisms and target sequence probes (e.g., exomes), and transcriptome sequencing. These approaches generate different types and quantities of data, and many can be applied with limited or no prior genomic resources, thus overcoming one traditional limitation of research on NMOs.

In this study, we assessed the relative importance of spatial distribution, ocean currents and sea surface temperature (SST) on patterns of putatively neutral and adaptive genetic variation among American lobster from 19 locations using population differentiation (PD) approaches combined with environmental association (EA) analyses. First, PD approaches (using bayescan, arlequin and outflank) found 28 outlier SNPs putatively under divergent selection and 9770 neutral SNPs in common. Redundancy analysis revealed that spatial distribution, ocean current-mediated larval connectivity and SST explained 31.7% of the neutral genetic differentiation, with ocean currents driving the majority of this relationship (21.0%). After removing the influence of spatial distribution, no SST were significant for putatively neutral genetic variation whereas minimum annual SST still had a significant impact and explained 8.1% of the putatively adaptive genetic variation. Second, EA analyses (using Pearson correlation tests, bayescenv and lfmm) jointly identified seven SNPs as candidates for thermal adaptation. Covariation at these SNPs was assessed with a spatial multivariate analysis that highlighted a significant temperature association, after accounting for the influence of spatial distribution. Among the 505 candidate SNPs detected by at least one of the three approaches, we discovered three polymorphisms located in genes previously shown to play a role in thermal adaptation. Our results have implications for the management of the American lobster and provide a foundation on which to predict how this species will cope with climate change. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","candidate gene; larval dispersal; marine invertebrate; RADseq; seascape genetics; thermal adaptation","acclimatization; animal; biological model; female; gene frequency; genetics; genomics; multivariate analysis; Nephropidae; North America; population genetics; single nucleotide polymorphism; spatial analysis; temperature; water flow; Acclimatization; Animals; Female; Gene Frequency; Genetics, Population; Genomics; Models, Genetic; Multivariate Analysis; Nephropidae; North America; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Spatial Analysis; Temperature; Water Movements",Article,"",Scopus

The population structure of harbor porpoises from the Baltic Sea, which is connected with the North Sea through a series of basins separated by shallow underwater ridges, however, is more complex. Here, we investigated the population differentiation of harbor porpoises in European Seas with a special focus on the Baltic Sea and adjacent waters, using a population genomics approach. We used 2872 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), derived from double digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD-seq), as well as 13 microsatellite loci and mitochondrial haplotypes for the same set of individuals. Spatial principal components analysis (sPCA), and Bayesian clustering on a subset of SNPs suggest three main groupings at the level of all studied regions: the Black Sea, the North Atlantic, and the Baltic Sea. Furthermore, we observed a distinct separation of the North Sea harbor porpoises from the Baltic Sea populations, and identified splits between porpoise populations within the Baltic Sea. We observed a notable distinction between the Belt Sea and the Inner Baltic Sea sub-regions. Improved delineation of harbor porpoise population assignments for the Baltic based on genomic evidence is important for conservation management of this endangered cetacean in threatened habitats, particularly in the Baltic Sea proper. In addition, we show that SNPs outperform microsatellite markers and demonstrate the utility of RAD-tags from a relatively small, opportunistically sampled cetacean sample set for population diversity and divergence analysis. © 2016 Lah et al.

To protect marine biodiversity, how do we surveil, document and predict the short- and long-term impacts of pollutants on at-risk species? Modern genomics tools offer high-throughput, information-rich and increasingly cost-effective approaches for characterizing biological responses to environmental stress, and are important tools within an increasing sophisticated kit for surveiling and assessing impacts of pollutants on marine species. Through the lens of recent research in marine killifish, we illustrate how genomics tools may be useful for screening chemicals and pollutants for biological activity and to reveal specific mechanisms of action. The high dimensionality of transcriptomic responses enables their usage as highly specific fingerprints of exposure, and these fingerprints can be used to diagnose environmental problems. We also emphasize that molecular pathways recruited to respond at physiological timescales are the same pathways that may be targets for natural selection during chronic exposure to pollutants. Gene complement and sequence variation in those pathways can be related to variation in sensitivity to environmental pollutants within and among species. Furthermore, allelic variation associated with evolved tolerance in those pathways could be tracked to estimate the pace of environmental health decline and recovery. We finish by integrating these paradigms into a vision of how genomics approaches could anchor a modernized framework for advancing the predictive capacity of environmental and ecotoxicological science. © The Author 2015.

Results and discussion: Through efforts to sequence the genome of this cyanobacterial strain, the 5.99 MB genome of an unknown bacterium emerged from the metagenomic information, named here as Mor1. Analysis of its genome revealed that the bacterium is heterotrophic and belongs to the phylum Acidobacteria, subgroup 22; however, it is only 85 % identical to the nearest cultured representative. Comparative genomics further revealed that Mor1 has a large number of genes involved in transcriptional regulation, is completely devoid of transposases, is not able to synthesize the full complement of proteogenic amino acids and appears to lack genes for nitrate uptake. Mor1 was found to be present in lab cultures of M. producens collected from various locations, but not other cyanobacterial species. Diverse efforts failed to culture the bacterium separately from filaments of M. producens JHB. Additionally, a co-culturing experiment between M. producens JHB possessing Mor1 and cultures of other genera of cyanobacteria indicated that the bacterium was not transferable.

Despite its popularity, our knowledge about its adaptive immunity and evolution is very limited. Furthermore, nothing is known about the genomics and evolution of dolphin antigen receptor immunity. Results: Here we report a evolutionary and expression study of Tursiops truncatus T cell receptor gamma (TRG) and alpha/delta (TRA/TRD) genes. We have identified in silico the TRG and TRA/TRD genes and analyzed the relevant mature transcripts in blood and in skin from four subjects. The dolphin TRG locus is the smallest and simplest of all mammalian loci as yet studied. It shows a genomic organization comprising two variable (V1 and V2), three joining (J1, J2 and J3) and a single constant (C), genes. Despite the fragmented nature of the genome assemblies, we deduced the TRA/TRD locus organization, with the recent TRDV1 subgroup genes duplications, as it is expected in artiodactyls. Expression analysis from blood of a subject allowed us to assign unambiguously eight TRAV genes to those annotated in the genomic sequence and to twelve new genes, belonging to five different subgroups. All transcripts were productive and no relevant biases towards TRAV-J rearrangements are observed. Blood and skin from four unrelated subjects expression data provide evidence for an unusual ratio of productive/unproductive transcripts which arise from the TRG V-J gene rearrangement and for a ""public"" gamma delta TR repertoire. The productive cDNA sequences, shared both in the same and in different individuals, include biases of the TRGV1 and TRGJ2 genes. The high frequency of TRGV1-J2/TRDV1- D1-J4 productive rearrangements in dolphins may represent an interesting oligo-clonal population comparable to that found in human with the TRGV9- JP/TRDV2-D-J T cells and in primates. Conclusions: Although the features of the TRG and TRA/TRD loci organization reflect those of the so far examined artiodactyls, genomic results highlight in dolphin an unusually simple TRG locus. The cDNA analysis reveal productive TRA/TRD transcripts and unusual ratios of productive/unproductive TRG transcripts. Comparing multiple different individuals, evidence is found for a ""public"" gamma delta TCR repertoire thus suggesting that in dolphins as in human the gamma delta TCR repertoire is accompanied by selection for public gamma chain. © 2016 The Author(s).","Dolphin genome; Expression analysis; IMGT; T cell receptor; TRA/TRD locus; TRAV and TRDV genes; TRG locus; TRGJ and TRGC genes; TRGV","complementary DNA; lymphocyte antigen receptor; RNA; adult; Article; computer model; evolution; female; gene duplication; gene expression; gene locus; gene rearrangement; gene sequence; genetic transcription; genomics; male; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; receptor gene; TRA gene; TRD gene; TRG gene; Tursiops truncatus; amino acid sequence; animal; blood; bottlenose dolphin; classification; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; human; isolation and purification; metabolism; molecular genetics; phylogeny; protein secondary structure; sequence alignment; skin; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Bottle-Nosed Dolphin; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetic Loci; Humans; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Protein Structure, Secondary; Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta; Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta; RNA; Sequence Alignment; Skin",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Recently, a nanomolar method was developed to measure cyanate concentrations in marine and estuarine waters. Here we report the first measurements of cyanate distributions, biological utilization, and production from the coastal North Atlantic Ocean. Cyanate concentrations were highest below the chlorophyll maximum at many stations but were high throughout the water column on the shallow Georges Bank where chlorophyll concentrations were especially high down to the bottom, suggesting production by organic matter degradation or release by phytoplankton. Here we demonstrate that cyanate is produced in senescent algal cultures and through photochemical reactions at rates comparable to rates of production of other labile nitrogen compounds. Cyanate uptake accounted for up to 10% of total N uptake at an oligotrophic mid-Atlantic Bight station.

Nearly half of dark carbon fixation in the oceans occurs in coastal sediments, but the microorganisms responsible are largely unknown. By integrating the 16S rRNA approach, single-cell genomics, metagenomics and transcriptomics with 14 C-carbon assimilation experiments, we show that uncultured Gammaproteobacteria account for 70-86% of dark carbon fixation in coastal sediments. First, we surveyed the bacterial 16S rRNA gene diversity of 13 tidal and sublittoral sediments across Europe and Australia to identify ubiquitous core groups of Gammaproteobacteria mainly affiliating with sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. These also accounted for a substantial fraction of the microbial community in anoxic, 490-cm-deep subsurface sediments. We then quantified dark carbon fixation by scintillography of specific microbial populations extracted and flow-sorted from sediments that were short-term incubated with 14 C-bicarbonate. We identified three distinct gammaproteobacterial clades covering diversity ranges on family to order level (the Acidiferrobacter, JTB255 and SSr clades) that made up >50% of dark carbon fixation in a tidal sediment. Consistent with these activity measurements, environmental transcripts of sulfur oxidation and carbon fixation genes mainly affiliated with those of sulfur-oxidizing Gammaproteobacteria. The co-localization of key genes of sulfur and hydrogen oxidation pathways and their expression in genomes of uncultured Gammaproteobacteria illustrates an unknown metabolic plasticity for sulfur oxidizers in marine sediments. Given their global distribution and high abundance, we propose that a stable assemblage of metabolically flexible Gammaproteobacteria drives important parts of marine carbon and sulfur cycles. © 2016 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.",,"bacterium; biogeochemistry; carbon fixation; carbon sink; coastal sediment; dark; genetic analysis; genomics; hydrogen; microbial activity; microbial community; oxidation; proteomics; sulfur; sulfur cycle; Australia; Europe; Bacteria (microorganisms); Gammaproteobacteria; uncultured gamma proteobacterium; carbon; sulfur; Australia; carbon cycle; DNA sequence; Europe; Gammaproteobacteria; gene expression profiling; genetics; geography; isolation and purification; metabolism; metagenomics; microbiology; oxidation reduction reaction; sea; sediment; Australia; Carbon; Carbon Cycle; Europe; Gammaproteobacteria; Gene Expression Profiling; Geography; Geologic Sediments; Metagenomics; Oceans and Seas; Oxidation-Reduction; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Sulfur",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus

The population genomics of the fissiparous L. pseudolacteus is characterized by an extremely high level of heterozygosity and unexpectedly elevated πN /πS ratio, in apparent agreement with theoretical expectations under clonal evolution.

Under this triad, phylogenetics is oriented towards the past history of biodiversity, conserving the divergent branches in the tree of life. The ecological component is rooted in the present, maintaining the contemporary life support systems for biodiversity. Evolutionary conservation (as defined here) is concerned with preserving the raw materials for generating future biodiversity. All 3 domains can be documented with genetic case histories in the waters of the Hawaiian Archipelago, an isolated chain of volcanic islands with 2 types of biodiversity: colonists, and new species that arose from colonists. This review demonstrates that 1) phylogenetic studies have identified previously unknown branches in the tree of life that are endemic to Hawaiian waters; 2) population genetic surveys define isolated marine ecosystems as management units, and 3) phylogeographic analyses illustrate the pathways of colonization that can enhance future biodiversity.

Metabolomics measures all (or a subset) metabolites in a cell at a specific time point, reflecting a snapshot of all the regulatory events responding to the external environmental conditions. Although metabolomics and systems biology approaches have been applied to the study of terrestrial plants, few marine macrophytes have been examined using these novel technologies. Marine macrophytes (including seaweeds and seagrasses) are marine ecosystem engineers delivering a range of ecologically and economically valuable biological services; however they are under threat from a wide range of anthropogenic stressors, climate variation, invasive species and pathogens. Investigating metabolomic regulation in these organisms is crucial to understand their acclimation, adaptation and defence responses to environmental challenges. This review describes the current analytical tools available to study metabolomics in marine macrophytes, along with their limitations for both targeted and non-targeted workflows. To illustrate recent advances in systems biology studies in marine macrophytes, we describe how metabolites are used in chemical defence to deter a broad range of invasive species and pathogens, as well as metabolomic reprogramming leading to acclimation or adaptive strategies to environmental and anthropogenic stresses. Where possible, the mechanistic processes associated with primary and secondary plant metabolism governing cellular homeostasis under extreme environments are discussed. Further, we provide a comprehensive overview of an in silico plant metabolome database that can be utilized to advance our knowledge from a system biology approach to marine macrophytes. Finally, functional integration of metabolomics with the allied ""omics"" disciplines of transcriptomics and proteomics, as well as the emerging discipline of ""fluxomics"" are discussed in the context of developing biological system networks, the identification of unknown gene/protein functions and the analysis of metabolic pathways in marine plants exposed to stress. © 2016.","Abiotic stress; Chemical defence; Metabolomics; Omics; Seagrass; Seaweeds; System biology",,Review,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

In the brine-seawater interface layer of Atlantis II Deep (Red Sea), Nitrospina-like bacteria constitute up to one-third of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences. This is much higher compared with that reported in other marine habitats (∼10% of all bacteria), and was unexpected because no NOB culture has been observed to grow above 4.0% salinity, presumably due to the low net energy gained from their metabolism that is insufficient for both growth and osmoregulation. Using phylogenetics, single-cell genomics and metagenomic fragment recruitment approaches, we document here that these Nitrospina-like bacteria, designated as Candidatus Nitromaritima RS, are not only highly diverged from the type species Nitrospina gracilis (pairwise genome identity of 69%) but are also ubiquitous in the deeper, highly saline interface layers (up to 11.2% salinity) with temperatures of up to 52 °C. Comparative pan-genome analyses revealed that less than half of the predicted proteome of Ca. Nitromaritima RS is shared with N. gracilis. Interestingly, the capacity for nitrite oxidation is also conserved in both genomes. Although both lack acidic proteomes synonymous with extreme halophiles, the pangenome of Ca. Nitromaritima RS specifically encodes enzymes with osmoregulatory and thermoprotective roles (i.e., ectoine/hydroxyectoine biosynthesis) and of thermodynamic importance (i.e., nitrate and nitrite reductases). Ca. Nitromaritima RS also possesses many hallmark traits of microaerophiles and high-affinity NOB. The abundance of the uncultured Ca.

Large scale genomic sequencing projects revealed >100 mutations in any individual CRC. Many of these mutations are likely passenger mutations, and fewer are driver mutations. Of these, activating mutations in RAS proteins are essential for cancer initiation, progression, and/or resistance to therapy. There has been significant interest in developing drugs targeting mutated cancer gene products or downstream signaling pathways. Due to the number of mutations involved and inherent redundancy in intracellular signaling, drugs targeting one mutation or pathway have been either ineffective or led to rapid resistance. We have devised a strategy whereby multiple cancer pathways may be simultaneously targeted for drug discovery. For proof-of-concept, we targeted the oncogenic KRAS and HIF pathways, since oncogenic KRAS has been shown to be required for cancer initiation and progression, and HIF-1α and HIF-2α are induced by the majority of mutated oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in CRC. We have generated isogenic cell lines defective in either oncogenic KRAS or both HIF-1α and HIF-2α and subjected them to multiplex genomic, siRNA, and high-throughput small molecule screening. We have identified potential drug targets and compounds for preclinical and clinical development. Screening of our marine natural product library led to the rediscovery of the microtubule agent dolastatin 10 and the class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor largazole to inhibit oncogenic KRAS and HIF pathways. Largazole was further validated as an antiangiogenic agent in a HIF-dependent manner in human cells and in vivo in zebrafish using a genetic model with activated HIF. Our general strategy, coupling functional genomics with drug susceptibility or chemical-genetic interaction screens, enables the identification of potential drug targets and candidates with requisite selectivity. Molecules prioritized in this manner can easily be validated in suitable zebrafish models due to the genetic tractability of the system. Our multidimensional platform with cellular and organismal components can be extended to larger scale multiplex screens that include other mutations and pathways. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",,"dolastatin 10; histone deacetylase inhibitor; hypoxia inducible factor; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; hypoxia inducible factor 2alpha; K ras protein; largazole; natural product; unclassified drug; angiogenesis inhibitor; antineoplastic agent; basic helix loop helix transcription factor; biological product; endothelial PAS domain-containing protein 1; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; KRAS protein, human; molecular library; protein p21; small interfering RNA; transcriptome; animal experiment; antiangiogenic activity; Article; cancer cell line; cancer growth; chemical genetics; colorectal cancer; controlled study; drug screening; drug sensitivity; drug targeting; functional genomics; gene mutation; gene targeting; genetic model; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; molecular library; molecule; multiple cancer; nonhuman; oncogene; priority journal; signal transduction; tumor suppressor gene; zebra fish; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; chemistry; colon; Colorectal Neoplasms; drug effects; drug screening; gene inactivation; genetics; HCT 116 cell line; metabolism; pathology; pharmacology; procedures; rectum; RNA interference; Angiogenesis Inhibitors; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors; Biological Products; Colon; Colorectal Neoplasms; Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor; Gene Knockout Techniques; HCT116 Cells; Humans; Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras); Rectum; RNA Interference; RNA, Small Interfering; Signal Transduction; Small Molecule Libraries; Transcriptome; Zebrafish",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

Strategies that can prioritize the most prolific microbial strains and novel compounds are of great interest. Here, we present an integrated approach to evaluate the biosynthetic richness in bacteria and mine the associated chemical diversity. Thirteen strains closely related to Pseudoalteromonas luteoviolacea isolated from all over the Earth were analyzed using an untargeted metabolomics strategy, and metabolomic profiles were correlated with whole-genome sequences of the strains. We found considerable diversity: only 2% of the chemical features and 7% of the biosynthetic genes were common to all strains, while 30% of all features and 24% of the genes were unique to single strains. The list of chemical features was reduced to 50 discriminating features using a genetic algorithm and support vector machines. Features were dereplicated by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) networking to identify molecular families of the same biosynthetic origin, and the associated pathways were probed using comparative genomics. Most of the discriminating features were related to antibacterial compounds, including the thiomarinols that were reported from P. luteoviolacea here for the first time. By comparative genomics, we identified the biosynthetic cluster responsible for the production of the antibiotic indolmycin, which could not be predicted with standard methods. In conclusion, we present an efficient, integrative strategy for elucidating the chemical richness of a given set of bacteria and link the chemistry to biosynthetic genes. IMPORTANCE We here combine chemical analysis and genomics to probe for new bioactive secondary metabolites based on their pattern of distribution within bacterial species. We demonstrate the usefulness of this combined approach in a group of marine Gram-negative bacteria closely related to Pseudoalteromonas luteoviolacea, which is a species known to produce a broad spectrum of chemicals. The approach allowed us to identify new antibiotics and their associated biosynthetic pathways. Combining chemical analysis and genetics is an efficient “mining” workflow for identifying diverse pharmaceutical candidates in a broad range of microorganisms and therefore of great use in bioprospecting.74.

Some diseases have impacted commercial species including MSX and Dermo of the eastern oyster, QPX of hard clams, withering syndrome of abalone and ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1) infections of many molluscs. Although the exact transmissionmechanisms are notwell understood, human activities and associated environmental changes often correlate with increased disease prevalence. For instance, hatcheries and large-scale aquaculture create high host densities, which, along with increasing ocean temperature, might have contributed to OsHV-1 epizootics in scallops and oysters. A key to understanding linkages between the environment and disease is to understand how the environment affects the host immune system. Although we might be tempted to downplay the role of immunity in invertebrates, recent advances in genomics have provided insights into host and parasite genomes and revealed surprisingly sophisticated innate immune systems in molluscs. All major innate immune pathways are found in molluscs with many immune receptors, regulators and effectors expanded. The expanded gene families provide great diversity and complexity in innate immune response, which may be key to mollusc’s defence against diverse pathogens in the absence of adaptive immunity.

A combination of unique physicochemical properties and spatial niche-specific substrates, in wide-ranging and extreme habitats, underscores the potential of the marine environment to deliver on functionally novel biocatalytic activities. With the growing need for green alternatives to industrial processes, and the unique transformations which nature is capable of performing, marine biocatalysts have the potential to markedly improve current industrial pipelines. Furthermore, biocatalysts are known to possess chiral selectivity and specificity, a key focus of pharmaceutical drug design.

Genome sequencing has revealed that cyanobacteria have the capacity to produce many more secondary metabolites than have been characterized. The biosynthetic pathways that encode cyanobacterial natural products are mostly uncharacterized, and lack of cyanobacterial genetic tools has largely prevented their heterologous expression. Hence, a combination of cutting edge and traditional techniques has been required to elucidate their secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways. Here, we review the discovery and refined biochemical understanding of the olefin synthase and fatty acid ACP reductase/aldehyde deformylating oxygenase pathways to hydrocarbons, and the curacin A, jamaicamide A, lyngbyabellin, columbamide, and a trans-acyltransferase macrolactone pathway encoding phormidolide.

Current data show that P availability is growth-limiting in certain marine systems and can impact algal species composition. Available P occurs in marine waters as dissolved inorganic phosphate (primarily orthophosphate [Pi]) or as a myriad of dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) compounds. Despite numerous studies on P physiology and ecology and increasing research on genomics in marine phytoplankton, there have been few attempts to synthesize information from these different disciplines. This paper is aimed to integrate the physiological and molecular information on the acquisition, utilization, and storage of P in marine phytoplankton and the strategies used by these organisms to acclimate and adapt to variations in P availability. Where applicable, we attempt to identify gaps in our current knowledge that warrant further research and examine possible metabolic pathways that might occur in phytoplankton from well-studied bacterial models. Physical and chemical limitations governing cellular P uptake are explored along with physiological and molecular mechanisms to adapt and acclimate to temporally and spatially varying P nutrient regimes. Topics covered include cellular Pi uptake and feedback regulation of uptake systems, enzymatic utilization of DOP, P acquisition by phagotrophy, P-limitation of phytoplankton growth in oceanic and coastal waters, and the role of P-limitation in regulating cell size and toxin levels in phytoplankton. Finally, we examine the role of P and other nutrients in the transition of phytoplankton communities from early succession species (diatoms) to late succession ones (e.g., dinoflagellates and haptophytes). © 2016 Phycological Society of America.","Alkaline phosphatase; Diatoms; Dinoflagellates; Dissolved organic phosphorus; Genetics; Marine algae; Nutrients; Phosphate; Phosphorus uptake; Transporter","phosphate; phosphorus; sea water; acclimatization; adaptation; bioavailability; chemistry; diatom; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; Haptophyta; metabolism; physiology; phytoplankton; Acclimatization; Adaptation, Physiological; Biological Availability; Diatoms; Ecosystem; Haptophyta; Phosphates; Phosphorus; Phytoplankton; Seawater",Review,"",Scopus

Ecological interactions among bacteria are particularly challenging to address due to methodological limitations and uncertainties over how to recognize fundamental units of diversity and link them to the functional traits and evolutionary processes that led to their divergence. Here we show that two closely related marine actinomycete species can be differentiated based on competitive strategies. Using a direct challenge assay to investigate inhibitory interactions with members of the bacterial community, we observed a temporal difference in the onset of inhibition. The majority of inhibitory activity exhibited by Salinispora arenicola occurred early in its growth cycle and was linked to antibiotic production. In contrast, most inhibition by Salinispora tropica occurred later in the growth cycle and was more commonly linked to nutrient depletion or other sources. Comparative genomics support these differences, with S. arenicola containing nearly twice the number of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters as S. tropica, indicating a greater potential for secondary metabolite production. In contrast, S. tropica is enriched in gene clusters associated with the acquisition of growth-limiting nutrients such as iron. Coupled with differences in growth rates, the results reveal that S. arenicola uses interference competition at the expense of growth, whereas S. tropica preferentially employs a strategy of exploitation competition. The results support the ecological divergence of two co-occurring and closely related species of marine bacteria by providing evidence they have evolved fundamentally different strategies to compete in marine sediments. © 2016 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.",,"bacterium; conspecific; divergence; evolutionary biology; functional morphology; growth rate; inhibition; interference competition; marine ecosystem; microbial community; nutrient limitation; secondary metabolite; species diversity; Actinobacteria; Bacteria (microorganisms); Salinispora arenicola; Salinispora tropica; sea water; classification; genetics; genomics; microbiology; Micromonosporaceae; physiology; sediment; Genomics; Geologic Sediments; Micromonosporaceae; Seawater",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus

Limited genomic and transcriptional data are currently available to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the embryonic development of T. tridentatus. Here, we reported for the first time the de novo transcriptome assembly for T. tridentatus at embryonic developmental stage using Illumina RNA-seq platform. Approximate 38 million reads were obtained and further assembled into 133,212 unigenes. Sequence homology analysis against public databases revealed that 33,796 unigenes could be annotated with gene descriptions. Of the annotated unigenes, we identified a number of key components of several conserved metazoan signaling pathways (Hedgehog, Wnt, TGF-beta and Notch pathways) and other important regulatory genes involved in embryonic development. Targeted searching of Pax family genes which play critical roles in the formation of tissue and organ during embryonic development identified a complete set of Pax family genes. Moreover, the full length T. tridentatus Pax1/9a (TtPax1/9a) and Pax1/9b (TtPax1/ 9b) cDNA sequences were determined based on the transcriptome, demonstrating the immediate application of our database. Using quantitative real time PCR, we analyzed the expression patterns of TtPax1/9a and TtPax1/9b in different tissues of horseshoe crab. Taking advantage of Drosophila model, we further found that TtPax1/9b, but not TtPax1/9a, can partly rescue the Drosophila homolog Poxm dysfunction-caused lethality at the larval stage. Our study provides the embryonic transcriptome of T. tridentatus which could be immediately used for gene discovery and characterization, functional genomics studies in T. tridentatus.

It is a measure of the variety of organisms present in different ecosystems. This can refer to genetic variation, ecosystem variation, or species variation (number of species) within an area, biome, or planet. Terrestrial biodiversity tends to be highest near the equator, which seems to be the result of the warm climate and high primary productivity. Biodiversity is not distributed evenly on Earth. It is the richest in the tropics. Marine biodiversity tends to be highest along coasts in the Western Pacific, where sea surface temperature is highest and in the mid-latitudinal band in all oceans. There are latitudinal gradients in species diversity. Biodiversity generally tends to cluster in hotspots, and has been increasing through time but will be likely to slow in the future. The prospects of exploring biodiversity for new medicines, foods, crops, insecticides, pesticides and other commercially valuable genetic and biological products and processes are booming, thanks to the rapid development in biotechnology-particularly genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, enzymatic and transgenic technologies-Herbal Technology and Information Technology. This exploration of biodiversity for commercially valuable genetic and biochemical resources is termed as ""bioprospecting"".

These adhesives vary structurally and biochemically between species and between life stages to satisfy the requirements of the particular organism for permanent or temporary/reversible adhesion, often under hostile conditions. To date, a small number of bioadhesives have been described for the adult forms of marine invertebrates, while a functional understanding of larval adhesives remains elusive. Progress is essential, however, since the larval forms perform a key role in the fouling of marine structures, and their adhesives may have characteristics of interest for development of synthetic, bio-inspired glues. Despite recent advances in the fields of proteomics and genomics, major obstacles exist in the isolation and analysis of tiny quantities of larval adhesives, which have largely precluded these approaches. Further challenges relate to the in situ detection of larval adhesive materials, being usually secreted underwater and buried at the interface between a solid substrate and the organism’s body. Here, we discuss a range of novel experimental approaches that have surmounted these technical issues and provided useful insight into the morphology and composition of larval bioadhesives in situ. These involve imaging and spectroscopic approaches as well as nano-/micromechanical and surface-sensitive techniques that have enabled quantification of adhesion forces and surface adsorption of purified adhesive proteins. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,"Adhesion; Animals; Molecular biology; Offshore structures; Proteins; Adhesive materials; Developmental stage; Experimental approaches; In-situ detections; Marine invertebrates; Morphology and composition; Surface adsorption; Surface-sensitive technique; Glues",Book Chapter,"",Scopus

Individual organic ligands, isolated from microbial cultures or biosynthesized through genomics, can be structurally characterized via NMR and tandem MS analysis, but this is tedious and time-consuming. A complementary approach is to compare known properties of natural ligands, particularly their conditional binding constants, with those of model organic ligands, measured under suitable conditions. Such comparisons cannot be meaningfully interpreted unless the side-reaction coefficient (SRC) of the model ligand in seawater is thoroughly evaluated. We conducted series of potentiometric titrations, in non-coordinating medium at seawater ionic strength (0.7 M NaClO4) over a range of metal:ligand molar ratios, to study complexation of the siderophore desferrioxamine B (DFOB) with Mg and Ca, for which it has the highest affinity among the major seasalt cations. From similar titrations of acetohydroxamic acid in the absence and presence of methanesulfonate (mesylate), it was determined that Mg and Ca binding to this common DFOB counter-ion is not strong enough to interfere with the DFOB titrations. Stability constants were measured for all DFOB complexes with Mg and Ca including, for the first time, the bidentate complexes. No evidence was found for Mg and Ca coordination with the DFOB terminal amine. From the improved DFOB speciation, we calculated five SRCs for each of the five (de)protonated forms of DFOB in trace-metal-free seawater, yet we also present a more convenient definition of a single SRC that allows adjustment of all DFOB stability constants to seawater conditions, no matter which of these forms is selected as the ""component"" (reference species). An example of Cd speciation in seawater containing DFOB illustrates the non-trivial use of different SRCs for polyprotic, polydentate organic ligands. © 2016 Schijf and Burns.","Calcium; Desferrioxamine B; Magnesium; Potentiometric titration; Seawater; Side-reaction coefficient; Siderophore; Stability constant",,Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

The genus Citromicrobium, widely found in oligotrophic oceans, is a member of marine alphaproteobacterial AAPB. Nine Citromicrobium strains isolated from the South China Sea, the Mediterranean Sea, or the tropical South Atlantic Ocean were found to harbor identical 16S rRNA sequences. The sequencing of their genomes revealed high synteny in major regions. Nine genetic islands (GIs) involved mainly in type IV secretion systems, flagellar biosynthesis, prophage, and integrative conjugative elements, were identified by a fine-scale comparative genomics analysis. These GIs played significant roles in genomic evolution and divergence. Interestingly, the coexistence of two different photosynthetic gene clusters (PGCs) was not only found in the analyzed genomes but also confirmed, for the first time, to our knowledge, in environmental samples. The prevalence of the coexistence of two different PGCs may suggest an adaptation mechanism for Citromicrobium members to survive in the oceans. Comparison of genomic characteristics (e.g., GIs, average nucleotide identity [ANI], single-nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs], and phylogeny) revealed that strains within a marine region shared a similar evolutionary history that was distinct from that of strains isolated from other regions (South China Sea versus Mediterranean Sea). Geographic differences are partly responsible for driving the observed genomic divergences and allow microbes to evolve through local adaptation.

Here, we sequenced nine strains from the Streptomyces genus that were isolated from different longitudes, latitudes, and depths of the South China Sea. Then we compared these strains to 22 NCBI downloaded streptomycete strains. Thirty-one streptomycete strains are clearly grouped into a marine-derived subgroup and multiple source subgroup-based phylogenetic tree. The phylogenetic analyses have revealed the dynamic process underlying streptomycete genome evolution, and lateral gene transfer is an important driving force during the process. Pan-genomics analyses have revealed that streptomycetes have an open pan-genome, which reflects the diversity of these streptomycetes and guarantees the species a quick and economical response to diverse environments. Functional and comparative genomics analyses indicate that the marine-derived streptomycetes subgroup possesses some common characteristics of marine adaptation.

But as uncultured organisms, their physiology, metabolism, and basis for their gigantism are not well understood. Thus, a genomics approach, applied to a single Candidatus Thiomargarita nelsonii cell was employed to explore the genetic potential of one of these enigmatic giant bacteria. The Thiomargarita cell was obtained from an assemblage of budding Ca. T. nelsonii attached to a provannid gastropod shell from Hydrate Ridge, a methane seep offshore of Oregon, USA. Here we present a manually curated genome of Bud S10 resulting from a hybrid assembly of long Pacific Biosciences and short Illumina sequencing reads. With respect to inorganic carbon fixation and sulfur oxidation pathways, the Ca. T. nelsonii Hydrate Ridge Bud S10 genome was similar to marine sister taxa within the family Beggiatoaceae. However, the Bud S10 genome contains genes suggestive of the genetic potential for lithotrophic growth on arsenite and perhaps hydrogen. The genome also revealed that Bud S10 likely respires nitrate via two pathways: A complete denitrification pathway and a dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia pathway. Both pathways have been predicted, but not previously fully elucidated, in the genomes of other large, vacuolated, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. Surprisingly, the genome also had a high number of unusual features for a bacterium to include the largest number of metacaspases and introns ever reported in a bacterium. Also present, are a large number of other mobile genetic elements, such as insertion sequence (IS) transposable elements and miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs). In some cases, mobile genetic elements disrupted key genes in metabolic pathways. For example, a MITE interrupts hupL, which encodes the large subunit of the hydrogenase in hydrogen oxidation.

Currently, it is unknown whether these globally significant groups partition into specific niches with respect to micronutrients (e.g., trace metals) and how that may affect marine trace metal cycling. Here, we used comparative genomics to identify diverse iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, and zinc uptake capabilities in SAR11 and Roseobacter genomes and uncover surprising unevenness within and between lineages. The strongest predictors for the extent of the metal uptake gene content are the total number of transporters per genome, genome size, total metal transporters, and GC content, but numerous exceptions exist in both groups. Taken together, our results suggest that SAR11 have strongly minimized their trace metal uptake versatility, with high-affinity zinc uptake being a unique exception. The larger Roseobacter genomes have greater trace metal uptake versatility on average, but they also appear to have greater plasticity, resulting in phylogenetically similar genomes having largely different capabilities. Ultimately, phylogeny is predictive of the diversity and extent of 20 to 33% of all metal uptake systems, suggesting that specialization in metal utilization mostly occurred independently from overall lineage diversification in both SAR11 and Roseobacter. We interpret these results as reflecting relatively recent trace metal niche partitioning in both lineages, suggesting that concentrations and chemical forms of metals in the marine environment are important factors shaping the gene content of marine heterotrophic Alphaproteobacteria of the SAR11 and Roseobacter lineages. © 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

The paucity of genetic information relating to sparids, despite their growing economic value for aquaculture, provides the impetus for exploring the genomics of this fish group. Genomic tool development, such as genetic linkage maps provision, lays the groundwork for linking genotype to phenotype, allowing fine-mapping of loci responsible for beneficial traits. In this study, we applied ddRAD methodology to identify polymorphic markers in a full-sib family of common pandora. Employing the Illumina MiSeq platform, we sampled and sequenced a size-selected genomic fraction of 99 individuals, which led to the identification of 920 polymorphic loci. Downstream mapping analysis resulted in the construction of 24 robust linkage groups, corresponding to the karyotype of the species. The common pandora linkage map showed varying degrees of conserved synteny with four other teleost genomes, namely the European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax), Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), and medaka (Oryzias latipes), suggesting a conserved genomic evolution in Sparidae.Our work exploits the possibilities of genotyping by sequencing to gain novel insights into genome structure and evolution.

To understand the molecular immune mechanisms underlying the response to C. irritans, we first performed a comparative gene transcription analysis using livers from C. irritans-immunized L. croceas and from a control group through RNA-Seq technology. After the removal of low-quality sequences and assembly, 51360 contigs were obtained, with an average length of 1066.93 bp. Further, a blast analysis indicates that 30747 contigs can be annotated based on homology with matches in the NT, NR, gene, and string databases. A gene ontology analysis was used to classify 21598 genes according to three major functional categories: molecular function, cellular component, and biological process. Moreover, 14470 genes were found in 303 KEGG pathways. We used RSEM and EdgeR to determine that 3841 genes were significantly differentially expressed (FDR < 0.001), including 2129 up-regulated genes and 1712 down-regulated genes. A significant enrichment analysis of these differentially expressed genes and isogenes revealed major immune-related pathways, including the toll-like receptor, complement and coagulation cascades, and chemokine signaling pathways. In addition, 28748 potential simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were detected from 12776 transcripts, and 62992 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in the L. croceas liver transcriptome.

Here, using comparative genomics and molecular genetic approaches, we reveal that the capacity for choline catabolism is widespread in marine heterotrophs of the marine Roseobacter clade (MRC). Using the model bacterium Ruegeria pomeroyi, we confirm that the betA, betB and betC genes, encoding choline dehydrogenase, betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase and choline sulfatase, respectively, are involved in choline metabolism. The betT gene, encoding an organic solute transporter, was essential for the rapid uptake of choline but not glycine betaine (GBT). Growth of choline and GBT as a sole carbon source resulted in the re-mineralization of these nitrogen-rich compounds into ammonium. Oxidation of the methyl groups from choline requires formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase encoded by fhs in R.pomeroyi, deletion of which resulted in incomplete degradation of GBT. We demonstrate that this was due to an imbalance in the supply of reducing equivalents required for choline catabolism, which can be alleviated by the addition of formate. Together, our results demonstrate that choline metabolism is ubiquitous in the MRC and reveal the role of Fhs in methyl group oxidation in R.pomeroyi. © 2015 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"betaine; betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase; choline; choline dehydrogenase; choline-sulfatase; formate tetrahydrofolate ligase; sulfatase; aquatic species; genetics; genomics; metabolism; mutagenesis; Roseobacter; Aquatic Organisms; Betaine; Betaine-Aldehyde Dehydrogenase; Choline; Choline Dehydrogenase; Formate-Tetrahydrofolate Ligase; Genomics; Mutagenesis; Roseobacter; Sulfatases",Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus

The convergent evolution of neural circuits is evident from a diversity of unique adaptive strategies implemented by ctenophores, cnidarians, acoels, molluscs, and basal deuterostomes. But, further integration of biodiversity research and neuroscience is required to decipher critical events leading to development of complex integrative and cognitive functions.

This study aimed to elucidate the toxic effect of K. mikimotoi on marine organisms by using the genomics approach; RNA-sequence libraries were constructed, and data were analyzed to identify toxin-related genes. Next-generation sequencing produced 153,406 transcript contigs from the axenic culture of K. mikimotoi. BLASTX analysis against all assembled contigs revealed that 208 contigs were polyketide synthase (PKS) sequences. Thus, K. mikimotoi was thought to have several genes encoding PKS metabolites and to likely produce toxin-like polyketide molecules. Of all the sequences, approximately 30 encoded eight PKS genes, which were remarkably similar to those of Karenia brevis. Our phylogenetic analyses showed that these genes belonged to a new group of PKS type-I genes. Phylogenetic and active domain analyses showed that the amino acid sequence of four among eight Karenia PKS genes was not similar to any of the reported PKS genes. These PKS genes might possibly be associated with the synthesis of polyketide toxins produced by Karenia species. Further, a homology search revealed 10 contigs that were similar to a toxin gene responsible for the synthesis of saxitoxin (sxtA) in the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium fundyense. These contigs encoded A1-A3 domains of sxtA genes. Thus, this study identified some transcripts in K. mikimotoi that might be associated with several putative toxin-related genes.

It is quite possible that all microbial populations in the ocean are impacted by viral infections. Our knowledge of virus-host relationships, however, has been limited to a minute fraction of cultivated host groups. Here, we utilized single-cell sequencing to obtain genomic blueprints of viruses inside or attached to individual bacterial and archaeal cells captured in their native environment, circumventing the need for host and virus cultivation. A combination of comparative genomics, metagenomic fragment recruitment, sequence anomalies and irregularities in sequence coverage depth and genome recovery were utilized to detect viruses and to decipher modes of virus-host interactions. Members of all three tailed phage families were identified in 20 out of 58 phylogenetically and geographically diverse single amplified genomes (SAGs) of marine bacteria and archaea. At least four phage-host interactions had the characteristics of late lytic infections, all of which were found in metabolically active cells. One virus had genetic potential for lysogeny. Our findings include first known viruses of Thaumarchaeota, Marinimicrobia, Verrucomicrobia and Gammaproteobacteria clusters SAR86 and SAR92. Viruses were also found in SAGs of Alphaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes.

Mutualistic and commensal planktonic interactions are most commonly encountered in the oligotrophic open ocean at tropical and subtropical latitudes. They are functionally and ecologically distinct, and involve a great taxonomic diversity of single-celled partners. Protists like Foraminifera, Radiolaria, dinoflagellates and diatoms can all harbor microalgal symbionts of eukaryotic and prokaryotic origin inside (endosymbiosis) and/or outside (ectosymbiosis) their cytoplasm. Such symbioses (photosymbioses) combine phototrophy, heterotrophy and sometimes dinitrogen (N2 ) fixation (reduction of N2 to ammonium). Symbiotic microorganisms therefore represent an important component of marine ecosystems and play a role in the food web and biogeochemical cycling (e.g., carbon and nitrogen). Despite their important ecological function and early recognition in the late nineteenth century, our knowledge about the diversity, distribution, and metabolic exchanges for many of the photosymbioses remains rudimentary compared with the other marine and terrestrial symbioses. Recent technical advances in Single-Cell genomics and imaging have greatly improved our understanding about planktonic symbioses. This review aims to present and compare many Eukaryote-Eukaryote and Eukaryote-Prokaryote photosymbioses described so far in the open ocean with an emphasis on their ecology and potential function in the ecosystem. © Springer Japan 2015.

The lobosamides display growth inhibitory activity against the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei (lobosamide A IC50 = 0.8 μM), the causative agent of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT). The biosynthetic gene cluster of the lobosamides was sequenced and suggests a conserved cluster organization among the 26-membered macrolactams.

The rising pCO2 and resulting pH decrease has altered ocean carbonate chemistry. Microbes are key components of marine environments involved in nutrient cycles and carbon flow in marine ecosystems. However, these marine microbes and the microbial processes are sensitive to ocean pH shift. Thus, OA affects the microbial diversity, primary productivity and trace gases emission in oceans. Apart from that, it can also manipulate the microbial activities such as quorum sensing, extracellular enzyme activity and nitrogen cycling. Short-term laboratory experiments, mesocosm studies and changing marine diversity scenarios have illustrated undesirable effects of OA on marine microorganisms and ecosystems. However, from the microbial perspective, the current understanding on effect of OA is based mainly on limited experimental studies. It is challenging to predict response of marine microbes based on such experiments for this complex process. To study the response of marine microbes towards OA, multiple approaches should be implemented by using functional genomics, new generation microscopy, small-scale interaction among organisms and/or between organic matter and organisms. This review focuses on the response of marine microorganisms to OA and the experimental approaches to investigate the effect of changing ocean carbonate chemistry on microbial mediated processes. © 2015 Institute of Oceanology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.","Climate change; Ecosystem; Marine microorganisms; Mesocosm; Ocean acidification","acidification; climate change; marine ecosystem; mesocosm; microbial activity; microorganism; primary production; species diversity; trace gas",Article,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus

For instance, the efficiency of protected areas in sustaining locally endangered populations and ecosystems depends on reserve network connectivity. The population genetics theory offers a powerful framework for estimating dispersal distances and migration rates from molecular data. In the marine realm, however, decades of molecular studies have met limited success in inferring genetic connectivity, due to the frequent lack of spatial genetic structure in species exhibiting high fecundity and dispersal capabilities. This is especially true within biogeographic regions bounded by well-known hotspots of genetic differentiation. Here, we provide an overview of the current methods for estimating genetic connectivity using molecular markers and propose several directions for improving existing approaches using large population genomic datasets. We highlight several issues that limit the effectiveness of methods based on neutral markers when there is virtually no genetic differentiation among samples. We then focus on alternative methods based on markers influenced by selection. Although some of these methodologies are still underexplored, our aim was to stimulate new research to test how broadly they are applicable to nonmodel marine species. We argue that the increased ability to apply the concepts of cline analyses will improve dispersal inferences across physical and ecological barriers that reduce connectivity locally. We finally present how neutral markers hitchhiking with selected loci can also provide information about connectivity patterns within apparently well-mixed biogeographic regions. We contend that one of the most promising applications of population genomics is the use of outlier loci to delineate relevant conservation units and related eco-geographic features across which connectivity can be measured. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Connectivity; Gene flow; Marine conservation; Population genomics; Population structure",,Review,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

This process is specific in egg and eleutheroembryos, when energetic and structural lipids, located at the yolk sac, need to be mobilized in order to be incorporated in the new forming embryo, or to produce energy. Here, we describe the transcriptional profile of 11 genes that codify for proteins involved in intercellular lipid transport and cholesterol metabolism during the early development of a marine teleost fish (Scophthalmus maximus), from notochord formation to the period beyond mouth opening. The mRNA expression pattern of genes (apoA1, apoB100, apoE, cetp, mtp, pltp, lipC, lpl, hmgcr1, soat1, lcat) is described and related to previously published lipid levels in larvae and PPARs—peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors—mRNA levels from the same experiment (Cunha et al. in Mar Genomics 10:17–25, 2013). Our findings show that the transcription of genes responsible for apolipoproteins production starts soon before hatching and that activities decline along the development. In contrast, genes responsible for cholesterol synthesis have a low transcription level early in the development and their activity increases later. Apolipoproteins and other genes related to reverse cholesterol transport are possibly under the control of Pparα2, while the expression of extracellular lipid transfer proteins and enzymes involved in cholesterol synthesis is possibly under the simultaneous control of Pparα1 and Pparγ.

Metabolomics attempts to systematically integrate metabolic processes using data accumulated from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS). NMR exploits the absorption and re-emission of electromagnetic radiation by nuclei exposed to a magnetic field. Additionally, NMR reveals the specific quantum mechanical magnetic properties of the atomic nucleus. MS is an analytical technique that provides spectra of the masses of the atoms or molecules comprising a sample. From these spectra, researchers can determine the elemental or isotopic signature of a sample, the masses of its constituent particles and molecules, and the chemical structures of molecules such as peptides. NMR and MS are among the most widely used technical platforms in metabolomics research, enabling the acquisition of detailed and systematic information of the biological systems under study. Currently, metabolomics has become an effective tool in researching traditional ecologies such as soil and marine ecology. At present, metabolomics is increasingly connecting with other systematic ‘omics’ fields such as proteomics and genomics. The fusion of ecology with metabolomics and the merging of metabolomics with other relevant techniques promise the establishment and development of a new ‘omics’ field—ecological metabolomics, or ecometabolomics. Ecometabolomics primarily aims to identify the global metabolomic response of an organism to environmental changes, and thereby enhance our understanding of how different species interact and co-evolve. Increasingly, ecologists are recognizing the importance of understanding how the metabolome and total number of metabolites respond to environmental changes. In four sections, this paper discusses recent applications of metabolomics techniques in ecological studies. The first section introduces the concepts of metabolomics and ecometabolomics and outlines their developmental history. The second section focuses on the widely used NMR and MS techniques. NMR includes1H NMR,13C NMR,31P NMR,17O NMR and15N NMR, whereas MS techniques include gas chromatogram-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), liquid chromatogram-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and directed infusion or injection mass spectrometry (DIMS). In the third section, the application status of metabolomics techniques in ecological research is discussed from two perspectives. At the biological tissue level, metabolomics has been applied to individual, population, and community ecologies. At the organism level, it has been adopted for species-level identification in animal ecology, plant ecology and microbial ecology. The forth section discusses the future challenges and perspectives of ecometabolomics. First, metabolomics will become more comprehensively integrated with other systematic biological techniques. Second, multiple analytical methods and techniques adopted in metabolomics will be simultaneously applied to single biological samples, enabling the synchronous accumulation of qualitative and quantitative data within a very short time. Third, a metabolomics database will be compiled and expanded to facilitate scientific research and to increase the analytical efficiency of both bioinformatics and metabolomics. The paper also suggests the roles for future ecologists. In conclusion, techniques relevant to metabolomics will be widely and intensively applied in ecological research such as pressure response, life cycle variation, population structure, interaction and circulation of nutrients, and ecological niches. © 2015 Ecological Society of China.

Quantitative data were analyzed using the geNorm software to assess the expression stability of the candidate reference genes, revealing that β-TUB and UBQ were the most stable genes. The commonly used GAPDH and 18S rRNA showed low stability, making them unsuitable candidates in this system. The expression pattern of the G protein β-subunit gene (Gβ) across tissue types was also examined and normalized to the expression of each or both of UBQ and β-TUB as internal controls. This revealed consistent trends with all three normalization approaches, thus validating the reliability of UBQ and β-TUB as optimal internal controls. The study provides the first validated reference genes for accurate data normalization in transcript profiling in Crassostrea angulata, which will be indispensable for further functional genomics studies in this economically valuable marine bivalve. © 2015, Chinese Society for Oceanology and Limnology, Science Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Crassostrea angulata; G protein β-subunit gene; gene expression; internal control gene; quantitative real-time PCR","Bivalvia; Crassostrea angulata; Ostreidae",Article,"",Scopus

The main goal of this study was to assess how a population genomics framework could help delineate the genetic structure of the American lobster (Homarus americanus) throughout much of the species' range and increase the assignment success of individuals to their location of origin. We genotyped 10 156 filtered SNPs using RAD sequencing to delineate genetic structure and perform population assignment for 586 American lobsters collected in 17 locations distributed across a large portion of the species' natural distribution range. Our results revealed the existence of a hierarchical genetic structure, first separating lobsters from the northern and southern part of the range (FCT = 0.0011; P-value = 0.0002) and then revealing a total of 11 genetically distinguishable populations (mean FST = 0.00185; CI: 0.0007-0.0021, P-value &lt; 0.0002), providing strong evidence for weak, albeit fine-scale population structuring within each region. A resampling procedure showed that assignment success was highest with a subset of 3000 SNPs having the highest FST. Applying Anderson's (Molecular Ecology Resources, 2010, 10, 701) method to avoid 'high-grading bias', 94.2% and 80.8% of individuals were correctly assigned to their region and location of origin, respectively. Lastly, we showed that assignment success was positively associated with sample size. These results demonstrate that using a large number of SNPs improves fine-scale population structure delineation and population assignment success in a context of weak genetic structure. We discuss the implications of these findings for the conservation and management of highly connected marine species, particularly regarding the geographic scale of demographic independence. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","American lobster; assignment test; fishery management; population genomics; single-nucleotide polymorphism marker","Homarus americanus; lobster; animal; genetic selection; genetics; genotyping technique; Nephropidae; North America; population genetics; sample size; single nucleotide polymorphism; Animals; Genetics, Population; Genotyping Techniques; Nephropidae; North America; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Sample Size; Selection, Genetic",Article,"",Scopus

As one of the first marine calcifiers to have its genome sequenced, purple sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) have been the subject of early research exploring genomic responses to ocean acidification, work that points to future experiments and illustrates the value of expanding genomic resources to other marine organisms in this new 'post-genomic' era. This review presents case studies of S. purpuratus demonstrating the ability of genomic experiments to address major knowledge gaps within ocean acidification. Ocean acidification research has focused largely on species vulnerability, and studies exploring mechanistic bases of tolerance toward low pH seawater are comparatively few. Transcriptomic responses to high pCO2 seawater in a population of urchins already encountering low pH conditions have cast light on traits required for success in future oceans. Secondly, there is relatively little information on whether marine organisms possess the capacity to adapt to oceans progressively decreasing in pH. Genomics offers powerful methods to investigate evolutionary responses to ocean acidification and recent work in S. purpuratus has identified genes under selection in acidified seawater. Finally, relatively few ocean acidification experiments investigate how shifts in seawater pH combine with other environmental factors to influence organism performance. In S. purpuratus, transcriptomics has provided insight into physiological responses of urchins exposed simultaneously to warmer and more acidic seawater. Collectively, these data support that similar breakthroughs will occur as genomic resources are developed for other marine species. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Adaptation; Climate change; Gene expression; Genomics; Ocean acidification; RNA-seq; Strongylocentrotus purpuratus; Transcriptomics; Urchin","sea water; carbon dioxide; acidification; ecosystem; environmental factor; gene identification; genomics; homeostasis; marine species; nonhuman; pH; Review; sea; Strongylocentrotus purpuratus; survival; transcriptomics; adaptive behavior; animal; chemistry; climate change; genetics; human; physiology; Strongylocentrotus purpuratus; Echinoidea; Strongylocentrotus purpuratus; Adaptation, Psychological; Animals; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Genomics; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Seawater; Strongylocentrotus purpuratus",Review,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

Optimization of microalgal species depends upon the selection of strains and their subsequent genetic/metabolic engineering.

These microalgae are rich in various lipids, carotenoids, sterols and isoprenoids, some of them containing toxins and other metabolites. Several groups of diatom natural products have attracted great interest due to their potential practical application as energy sources (biofuel), valuable food constituents, and prospective materials for nanotechnology. In addition, hydrocarbons, which are used in climate reconstruction, polyamines which participate in biomineralization, new apoptotic agents against tumor cells, attractants and deterrents that regulate the biochemical communications between marine species in seawaters have also been isolated from diatoms. However, chemical studies on these microalgae are complicated by difficulties, connected with obtaining their biomass, and the influence of nutrients and contaminators in their environment as well as by seasonal and climatic factors on the biosynthesis of the corresponding natural products. Overall, the number of chemically studied diatoms is lower than that of other algae, but further studies, particularly those connected with improvements in the isolation and structure elucidation technique as well as the genomics of diatoms, promise both to increase the number of studied species with isolated biologically active natural products and to provide a clearer perception of their biosynthesis. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI.","Diatoms; Domoic acid; Isoprenoid hydrocarbons; Lipids; Miscellaneous; Oxylipins; Pigments; Sterols","aldehyde; biofuel; domoic acid; fatty acid; fish oil; halide; hydrocarbon; isoprenoid; natural product; omega 3 fatty acid; oxylipin; pigment; polyamine; sex pheromone; sterol; toxin; triacylglycerol; biological product; biomass production; biomineralization; biosynthesis; climate change; diatom; fatty acid analysis; fatty acid synthesis; food web; genomics; human; lipid composition; marine species; metabolite; nonhuman; Review; trophic level; animal; aquatic species; biomass; chemistry; diatom; isolation and purification; metabolism; microalga; molecular weight; algae; Bacillariophyta; Animals; Aquatic Organisms; Biological Products; Biomass; Diatoms; Humans; Microalgae; Molecular Weight",Review,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Genomic and phenotypic analysis revealed V. antiquarius is closely related to pathogenic Vibrio species, namely Vibrio alginolyticus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio harveyi, and Vibrio vulnificus, but sufficiently divergent to warrant a separate species status. The V. antiquarius genome encodes genes and operons with ecological functions relevant to the environment conditions of the deep sea and also harbors factors known to be involved in human disease caused by freshwater, coastal, and brackish water vibrios.

Here, we sequenced a stress tolerant genotype i.e. Pseudomonas sp. strain RL isolated from a hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) contaminated pond (45 mg of total HCH g-1 sediment) and further compared its gene repertoire with 17 reference ecotypes belonging to P. stutzeri, P. mendocina, P. aeruginosa, P. psychrotolerans and P. denitrificans, representing metabolically diverse ecosystems (i.e. marine, clinical, and soil/sludge). Metagenomic data from HCH contaminated pond sediment and similar HCH contaminated sites were further used to analyze the pan-genome dynamics of Pseudomonas genotypes enriched across increasing HCH gradient. Results: Although strain RL demonstrated clear species demarcation (ANI ≤ 80.03%) from the rest of its phylogenetic relatives, it was found to be closest to P. stutzeri clade which was further complemented functionally. Comparative functional analysis elucidated strain specific enrichment of metabolic pathways like α-linoleic acid degradation and carbazole degradation in Pseudomonas sp. strain RL and P. stutzeri XLDN-R, respectively. Composition based methods (%codon bias and %G + C difference) further highlighted the significance of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in evolution of nitrogen metabolism, two-component system (TCS) and methionine metabolism across the Pseudomonas genomes used in this study. An intact mobile class-I integron (3,552 bp) with a captured gene cassette encoding for dihydrofolate reductase (dhfra1) was detected in strain RL, distinctly demarcated from other integron harboring species (i.e. P. aeruginosa, P. stutzeri, and P. putida). Mobility of this integron was confirmed by its association with Tnp21-like transposon (95% identity) suggesting stress specific mobilization across HCH contaminated sites. Metagenomics data from pond sediment and recently surveyed HCH adulterated soils revealed the in situ enrichment of integron associated transposase gene (TnpA6100) across increasing HCH contamination (0.7 to 450 mg HCH g-1 of soil). Conclusions: Unlocking the potential of comparative genomics supplemented with metagenomics, we have attempted to resolve the environment and strain specific demarcations across 18 Pseudomonas gene complements.

The recently available gonad transcriptome of the black-lip pearl oyster Pinctada margaritifera is a novel and powerful resource to study these mechanisms in marine mollusks displaying hermaphroditic features. In this study, RNAseq quantification data of the P. margaritifera gonad transcriptome were analyzed to identify candidate genes in histologicallycharacterized gonad samples to provide molecular signatures of the female and male sexual pathway in this pearl oyster. Based on the RNAseq data set, stringent expression analysis identified 1,937 contigs that were differentially expressed between the gonad histological categories. From the hierarchical clustering analysis, a new reproduction model is proposed, based on a dual histo-molecular analytical approach. Nine candidate genes were identified as markers of the sexual pathway: 7 for the female pathway and 2 for the male one. Their mRNA levels were assayed by real-time PCR on a new set of gonadic samples. A clustering method revealed four principal expression patterns based on the relative gene expression ratio. A multivariate regression tree realized on these new samples and validated on the previously analyzed RNAseq samples showed that the sexual pathway of P. margaritifera can be predicted by a 3-gene-pair expression ratio model of 4 different genes: pmarg-43476, pmarg-foxl2, pmarg-54338 and pmarg-fem1-like. This 3-gene-pair expression ratio model strongly suggests only the implication of pmarg-foxl2 and pmarg-fem1-like in the sex inversion of P. margaritifera. This work provides the first histo-molecular model of P. margaritifera reproduction and a gene expression signature of its sexual pathway discriminating the male and female pathways. These represent useful tools for understanding and studying sex inversion, sex differentiation and sex determinism in this species and other related species for aquaculture purposes such as genetic selection programs.

As much remains unknown about these organisms due to difficulties in cultivation, single-cell genomics was used to learn more about this elusive group at Loihi Seamount. Comparative genomics of 23 phylogenetically diverse single amplified genomes (SAGs) and two isolates indicate niche specialization among the Zetaproteobacteria may be largely due to oxygen tolerance and nitrogen transformation capabilities. Only Form II ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (RubisCO) genes were found in the SAGs, suggesting that some of the uncultivated Zetaproteobacteria may be adapted to low oxygen and/or high carbon dioxide concentrations. There is also genomic evidence of oxygen-tolerant cytochrome c oxidases and oxidative stress-related genes, indicating that others may be exposed to higher oxygen conditions. The Zetaproteobacteria also have the genomic potential for acquiring nitrogen from numerous sources including ammonium, nitrate, organic compounds, and nitrogen gas. Two types of molybdopterin oxidoreductase genes were found in the SAGs, indicating that those found in the isolates, thought to be involved in iron oxidation, are not consistent among all the Zetaproteobacteria. However, a novel cluster of redox-related genes was found to be conserved in 10 SAGs as well as in the isolates warranting further investigation. These results were used to isolate a novel iron-oxidizing Zetaproteobacteria.

The sigmoidal clines indicate the existence of a mussel hybrid zone in a region of genetic discontinuities for many continuously distributed coastal taxa, in particular marine invertebrates. Examination of the genetic architecture of the hybrid zone revealed the differential contribution of individual microsatellite loci and/or alleles to defining the zone of interaction and no evidence of increased allelic richness or heterozygosity inside versus outside the hybrid zone. Genomics cline analysis identified one locus in particular (Pcan1-27) as being different from neutral expectations, thereby contributing to lineage differentiation. Estimates of contemporary gene flow revealed very high levels of within-lineage self-recruitment and a hybrid zone composed mostly (∼85%) of northern immigrants.

Two types of observations from environmental samples — direct counts of viral particles and viral metagenomic sequences — have been critical to these discoveries. Accurate direct counts have established ecosystem-scale trends in the impacts of viral infection on microbial host populations and have shown that viral communities within aquatic and soil environments respond to both short term and seasonal environmental change. Direct counts have been critical for estimating viral production rate, a measurement essential to quantifying the implications of viral infection for the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients within ecosystems. While direct counts have defined the magnitude of viral processes; shotgun sequences of environmental viral DNA — virome sequences — have enabled researchers to estimate the diversity and composition of natural viral communities. Virome-enabled studies have found the virioplankton to contain thousands of viral genotypes in communities where the most dominant viral population accounts for a small fraction of total abundance followed by a long tail of diverse populations. Detailed examination of long virome sequences has led to new understanding of genotype-to-phenotype connections within marine viruses and revealed that viruses carry metabolic genes that are important to maintaining cellular energy during viral replication. Increased access to long virome sequences will undoubtedly reveal more genetic secrets of viruses and enable us to build a genomics rulebook for predicting key biological and ecological features of unknown viruses. © 2015, The Microbiological Society of Korea and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","informational proteins; viral ecology; viromics","virus DNA; ecosystem; genetic variability; genetics; metagenome; metagenomics; microbiology; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; physiology; sea; viral phenomena and functions; virus; virus genome; virus replication; Base Sequence; DNA, Viral; Ecosystem; Environmental Microbiology; Genetic Variation; Genome, Viral; Metagenome; Metagenomics; Oceans and Seas; Phylogeny; Virus Physiological Phenomena; Virus Replication; Viruses",Article,"",Scopus

In their predominant habitats, sulphate-rich marine sediments, SRP have long been recognized to be major players in the carbon and sulphur cycles. Other, more recently appreciated, ecophysiological roles include activity in the deep biosphere, symbiotic relations, syntrophic associations, human microbiome/health and long-distance electron transfer. SRP include a high diversity of organisms, with large nutritional versatility and broad metabolic capacities, including anaerobic degradation of aromatic compounds and hydrocarbons. Elucidation of novel catabolic capacities as well as progress in the understanding of metabolic and regulatory networks, energy metabolism, evolutionary processes and adaptation to changing environmental conditions has greatly benefited from genomics, functional OMICS approaches and advances in genetic accessibility and biochemical studies. Important biotechnological roles of SRP range from (i) wastewater and off gas treatment, (ii) bioremediation of metals and hydrocarbons and (iii) bioelectrochemistry, to undesired impacts such as (iv) souring in oil reservoirs and other environments, and (v) corrosion of iron and concrete. Here we review recent advances in our understanding of SRPs focusing mainly on works published after 2000.

These molecules, which can be catalogued as natural products, have long been exploited in medical fields as antibiotics, anticancer and anti-infective agents. Recent years have seen considerable advances in elucidating natural-product biosynthesis and many drugs used today are natural products or natural-product derivatives. The major contribution to recent knowledge came from application of genomics to secondary metabolism and was facilitated by all relevant genes being organised in a contiguous DNA segment known as gene cluster. Clustering of genes regulating biosynthesis in bacteria is virtually universal. Modular gene clusters can be mixed and matched during evolution to generate structural diversity in natural products. Biosynthesis of many natural products requires the participation of complex molecular machines known as polyketide synthases and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases. Discovery of new evolutionary links between the polyketide synthase and fatty acid synthase pathways may help to understand the selective advantages that led to evolution of secondary-metabolite biosynthesis within bacteria. Secondary metabolites confer selective advantages, either as antibiotics or by providing a chemical language that allows communication among species, with other organisms and their environment. Herewith, we discuss these aspects focusing on the most clinically relevant bioactive molecules, the thiotemplated modular systems that include polyketide synthases, non-ribosomal peptide synthetases and fatty acid synthases. We begin by describing the evolutionary and physiological role of marine natural products, their structural/functional features, mechanisms of action and biosynthesis, then turn to genomic and metagenomic approaches, highlighting how the growing body of information on microbial natural products can be used to address fundamental problems in environmental evolution and biotechnology. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Biosynthesis; Evolution; Gene cluster; Natural product; Structure/function","abyssomicin C; barbamide; bryostatin; curacin A; fatty acid synthase; hectochlorin; icosapentaenoic acid; microcystin; nodularin; nonribosomal peptide synthetase; polyketide synthase; salinosporamide A; unclassified drug; antiinfective agent; antineoplastic agent; biological product; peptide synthase; Article; bacterial genome; biosynthesis; codon usage; decarboxylation; electrophilicity; enzyme active site; enzyme specificity; fatty acid synthesis; gene cluster; gene conversion; gene duplication; gene loss; gene transfer; genome size; genomics; heterologous expression; hybrid gene; marine bacterium; marine microbial secondary metabolite; marine species; metabolite; metagenomics; nonhuman; phylogenetic tree; point mutation; polymerization; secondary metabolism; symbiosis; terrestrial species; aquatic species; genetics; metabolism; multigene family; secondary metabolism; Anti-Infective Agents; Antineoplastic Agents; Aquatic Organisms; Biological Products; Fatty Acid Synthases; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Multigene Family; Peptide Synthases; Polyketide Synthases; Secondary Metabolism",Book Chapter,"",Scopus

It is no exaggeration to claim that the twenty-first century belongs to biotechnology. Knowledge generation in this field is growing at a frenetic pace, and keeping abreast of the latest advances and calls on us to double our efforts. Volume II of this two-part series addresses cutting-edge aspects of plant genomics and biotechnology. It includes 37 chapters contributed by over 70 researchers, each of which is an expert in his/her own field of research. Biotechnology has helped to solve many conundrums of plant life that had long remained a mystery to mankind. This volume opens with an exhaustive chapter on the role played by thale cress, Arabidopsis thaliana, which is believed to be the Drosophila of the plant kingdom and an invaluable model plant for understanding basic concepts in plant biology. This is followed by chapters on bioremediation, biofuels and biofertilizers through microalgal manipulation, making it a commercializable prospect; discerning finer details of biotic stress with plant-fungal interactions; and the dynamics of abiotic and biotic stresses, which also figure elsewhere in the book. Breeding crop plants for desirable traits has long been an endeavor of biotechnologists. The significance of molecular markers, marker assisted selection and techniques are covered in a dedicated chapter, as are comprehensive reviews on plant molecular biology, DNA fingerprinting techniques, genomic structure and functional genomics. A chapter dedicated to organellar genomes provides extensive information on this important aspect. Elsewhere in the book, the newly emerging area of epigenetics is presented as seen through the lens of biotechnology, showcasing the pivotal role of DNA methylation in effecting permanent and transient changes to the genome. Exclusive chapters deal with bioinformatics and systems biology. Handy tools for practical applications such as somatic embryogenesis and micropropagation are included to provide frontline information to entrepreneurs, as is a chapter on somaclonal variation. Overcoming barriers to sexual incompatibility has also long been a focus of biotechnology, and is addressed in chapters on wide hybridization and hybrid embryo rescue. Another area of accomplishing triploids through endosperm culture is included as a non-conventional breeding strategy. Secondary metabolite production through tissue cultures, which is of importance to industrial scientists, is also covered. Worldwide exchange of plant genetic material is currently an essential topic, as is conserving natural resources in situ. Chapters on in vitro conservation of extant, threatened and other valuable germplasms, gene banking and related issues are included, along with an extensive account of the biotechnology of spices the low-volume, high-value crops. Metabolic engineering is another emerging field that provides commercial opportunities. As is well known, there is widespread concern over genetically modified crops among the public. GM crops are covered, as are genetic engineering strategies for combating biotic and abiotic stresses where no other solutions are in sight. RNAi- and micro RNA- based strategies for crop improvement have proved to offer novel alternatives to the existing non-conventional techniques, and detailed information on these aspects is also included. The books last five chapters are devoted to presenting the various aspects of environmental, marine, desert and rural biotechnology. The state-of-the-art coverage on a wide range of plant genomics and biotechnology topics will be of great interest to post-graduate students and researchers, including the employees of seed and biotechnology companies, and to instructors in the fields of plant genetics, breeding and biotechnology. © Springer India 2015.",,,Book,"",Scopus

During the last 10 years, interest in research and development by the scientific community in this niche have continued as evidenced from joint ventures between academics, mainly partnered with industry. Drugs of marine origin that have now been approved represent excellent and novel alternatives for the following therapies and disease treatments. For neuropathic pain, a synthetic version of omega-conotoxin, produced by the tropical marine Conus snail is already on the pharmaceutical market. The ecteinascidins (ET-743) are marine alkaloid, anticancer agents isolated from Ecteinascidia turbinate, a colonial tunicate found in the Caribbean and Mediterranean Sea, and are successfully used for soft tissue sarcoma and relapsed ovarian cancer. The synthetic pyrimidine nucleoside Cytarabine, was originally isolated from the Caribbean sponge Tethya crypta, and approved as a chemotherapeutic to treat different forms of leukemia (e.g, meningeal leukemia, lym-phocytic leukemia). From this marine sponge, also the synthetic purine nucleoside analog, Vidara-bine, was developed as an antiviral drug against the herpes simplex virus and the varicella-zoster virus for the treatment of epithelial keratitis, viz, ophthalmic applications. In 2012, squalamine was been awarded Fast Track designation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the potential treatment of the wet form of macular degeneration. These successful advances have had to overcome di?culties characteristic of marine natural products to become drugs, viz, sustainable sources, structural complexity, and toxicity, the same as the marine molecules in preclinical and clinical trials. In this chapter, the current advances and modern approaches of marine natural products and respective bioactive metabolites with potential and real functions as drugs leads are succinctly reviewed and particularly exemplified.

The world’s dependence on unsustainable fossil fuels (almost 90%), and the increasing population demand new sources of energy for sustainable human activities. Algae, and particularly microalgae have nowadays become of enormous importance as a new potential source of feedstock for renewable bioenergy production. As photosynthetic microorganisms, microalgae may potentially be produced as carbon neutral and can be produced on non-arable land and cultured in marine and wastewater e?uents. Furthermore, microalgae can be used to produce a range of products such as protein-rich animal feed in aquaculture, high-value products, viz, polyunsaturated fatty acids, bioactive and functional pigments and natural dyes, health foods, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. In this chapter, an update of the advances in microalgal biotechnology is presented as a new biomass for the potential development of biofuels, and as a realistic source of highly valuable molecules of industrial interest. The potential to harness endogenous carbon storage compounds, triacylglyceride (TAGs) and starch, as products of photosynthesis, including the photoproduction of hydrogen, can contribute to diversify the sources and yields of feedstocks for biofuel production. Even if the production of microalgae for biofuels is highly promissory and clearly has potential for contributing to environmental, social, and economic sustainability, presently this alternative is unsustainable. Definitely, the combination of bio-fuel production by microalgal biotechnology with co-products may contribute to the sustainability of biofuels, a condition with null or less impact on natural resources and biodiversity. The integration of all the components of the uses of microalgae, i. e, high-value compounds, aquaculture, and bioremediation coupled to the production of bio-fuels will play an important role in the near future to make the production of biofuels from microalgae sustainable.

The aquatic systems thus constitute a rich reservoir for various chemical materials and (bio-)chemical processes.Edited by a renowned expert with a longstanding experience, and including over 60 contributions from leading international scientists, the Springer Handbook of Marine Biotechnology is a major authoritative desk reference for everyone interested or working in the field of marine biotechnology and bioprocessing - from undergraduate and graduate students, over scientists and teachers, to professionals.Marine biotechnology is concerned with the study of biochemical materials and processes from marine sources, that play a vital role in the isolation of novel drugs, and to bring them to industrial and pharmaceutical development. Today, a multitude of bioprocess techniques is employed to isolate and produce marine natural compounds, novel biomaterials, or proteins and enzymes from marine organisms, and to bring them to applications as pharmaceuticals, cosmeceuticals or nutraceuticals, or for the production of bioenergy from marine sources. All these topics are addressed by the Springer Handbook of Marine Biotechnology.The book is divided into ten parts. Each part is consistently organized, so that the handbook provides a sound introduction to marine biotechnology - from historical backgrounds and the fundamentals, over the description of the methods and technology, to their applications - but it can also be used as a reference work.Key topics include: - Marine flora and fauna - Tools and methods in marine biotechnology - Marine genomics - Marine microbiology - Bioenergy and biofuels - Marine bioproducts in industrial applications - Marine bioproducts in medical and pharmaceutical applications - and many more. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.",,"Aquatic ecosystems; Aquatic organisms; Biotechnology; Marine biology; Students; Teaching; Chemical materials; Historical background; International scientists; Marine biotechnology; Marine microbiologies; Materials and process; Pharmaceutical applications; Pharmaceutical development; Marine applications",Book,"",Scopus

Three journals (Antarctic Science, Polar Biology, ZooKeys) represent almost 40% of these peer-review publications. The second appraisal focuses on the evolution of new RAMS records. We observed an important decrease in data additions since 2011. As a case study, we focused on an original dataset for a specific group (Asteroidea, Echinodermata). It appears that around one hundred species of asteroids are lacking in RAMS despite the relatively high availability of these data. This suggests that the users’ community (or collaborative projects such as AquaRES) could be helpful in order to maintain the RAMS database over the long term. © Quentin Jossart et al.","Antarctic; Asteroidea; Bibliometrics; Biodiversity; Register of Antarctic Marine Species; Southern Ocean",,Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) is an integral, dynamic part of the marine organic matter pool and of the phosphorus cycle, and is of fundamental significance to the understanding of microbial oceanography and marine biogeochemistry. Although much remains to be understood, several new discoveries have been made over the past decade with respect to our knowledge of the chemical composition and microbial processing of DOP in the oceans.In this chapter, we cover the history of the early years of marine phosphorus measurements to novel analytical techniques and the many challenges remaining into the twenty-first century. We describe the temporal and spatial variability of the global DOP pool inventories, both in terms of regional gradients as well as into the deep ocean interior. We further examine the tools available to characterize the chemically complex DOP pool and the gains made to identify specific DOP compounds, or compound classes. As is often the case, the picture is incomplete, but significant progress has been in the past decade, with refined analytical methodology. Additionally, we explore the role of DOP in the marine P-cycle, as DOP is produced, utilized by the extant microbial community and eventually remineralized.Finally, we are just beginning to understand the, previously underappreciated, reduction-oxidation pathways of phosphorus, and their relationships to cellular bioenergetics, biogeochemistry and ecology. The application of recently developed genomics based technology gives new opportunities to further our understanding of the dynamics and regulation of the marine microbial P-cycle. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, the metabolic functions and biogeochemical role of these microorganisms in the subsurface remains unrealized due to the lack of pure culture representatives. In this study of deep sediment from Antarctica's Adélie Basin, collected during Expedition 318 of the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP), Atribacteria-related sequences of the 16S rRNA gene were abundant (up to 51% of the sequences) and steadily increased in relative abundance with depth throughout the methane-rich zones. To better understand the metabolic potential of Atribacteria within this environment, and to compare with phylogenetically distinct Atribacteria from non-deep-sea environments, individual cells were sorted for single cell genomics from sediment collected from 97.41 m below the seafloor from IODP Hole U1357C. As observed for non-marine Atribacteria, a partial single cell genome suggests a heterotrophic metabolism, with Atribacteria potentially producing fermentation products such as acetate, ethanol, and CO2. These products may in turn support methanogens within the sediment microbial community and explain the frequent occurrence of Atribacteria in anoxic methane-rich sediments.

Recent attempts in supplying consistent, safe and environmentally acceptable biomass through cultivation of (macro- and micro-) algal biomass have concentrated on characterizing natural variability in bioactives, and optimizing cultivated materials through strain selection and hybridization, as well as breeding and, more recently, genetic improvements of biomass. Biotechnological tools including metabolomics, transcriptomics, and genomics have recently been extended to algae but, in comparison to microbial or plant biomass, still remain underdeveloped. Current progress in algal biotechnology is driven by an increased demand for new sources of biomass due to several global challenges, new discoveries and technologies available as well as an increased global awareness of the many applications of algae.

To investigate the environmental reservoir and potential gene flow that occurs among V. parahaemolyticus isolates, the virulence-associated gene content and genome diversity of a collection of 133 V. parahaemolyticus isolates were analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis of housekeeping genes, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, demonstrated that there is genetic similarity among V. parahaemolyticus clinical and environmental isolates. Whole-genome sequencing and comparative analysis of six representative V. parahaemolyticus isolates was used to identify genes that are unique to the clinical and environmental isolates examined. Comparative genomics demonstrated an O3:K6 environmental isolate, AF91, which was cultured from sediment collected in Florida in 2006, has significant genomic similarity to the post-1995 O3:K6 isolates. However, AF91 lacks the majority of the virulence-associated genes and genomic islands associated with these highly virulent post-1995 O3:K6 genomes. These findings demonstrate that although they do not contain most of the known virulence-associated regions, some V. parahaemolyticus environmental isolates exhibit significant genetic similarity to clinical isolates. This highlights the dynamic nature of the V. parahaemolyticus genome allowing them to transition between aquatic and host-pathogen states. © 2015 Hazen, Lafon, Garrett, Lowe, Silberger, Rowe, Frace, Parsons, Bopp, Rasko and Sobecky.","Environment; Genomics; O3:K6; Phylogenomics; Vibrio parahaemolyticus","Article; bacterial gene; bacterial virulence; bacteriophage; bacterium isolation; comparative genomics; gene identification; gene sequence; genetic similarity; genetic variability; genomic island; genomics; housekeeping gene; maximum likelihood method; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; plasmid; polymerase chain reaction; pulsed field gel electrophoresis; reservoir; serotyping; unindexed sequence; Vibrio parahaemolyticus; Bacteria (microorganisms); Vibrio parahaemolyticus",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

The Venice lagoon constitutes an excellent case, in which the assessment of environmental risks derived from the nearby industrial activities represents a crucial task.

A number of marine species, through their adhesive properties, also represent significant foulers that become increasingly problematic to aquaculture, shipping or local biodiversity. In order to develop more sophisticated man-made glues and/or efficient fouling resistant surfaces, it is important to understand the mechanical, structural andmolecular properties of adhesive organs in selected species. Ascidians are marine invertebrates with larvae that opportunistically attach to almost any type of submerged surface to undergo metamorphosis into permanently sessile adults. Not only do they represent a globally important fouling organism, but they are becoming increasingly popular as model organisms for developmental biology. The latter is due to their phylogenetic position as the sister group to the vertebrates and their cellular and molecular accessibility for experimentation. In this paper,we reviewthemechanismsof larval adhesion in ascidians and draw conclusions from comparative analyses of selected species.

While modifications of existing drugs have brought some limited clinical success, there remains a critical need for new classes of antimicrobial compound to which key clinical pathogens will be naive. This has provided the context and impetus to marine biodiscovery programmes that seek to isolate and characterize new activities from the aquatic ecosystem. One new antibiotic to emerge from these initiatives is the antibacterial compound tropodithietic acid (TDA). The aim of this study was to provide insight into the bioactivity of and the factors governing the production of TDA in marine Pseudovibrio isolates from a collection of marine sponges. The TDA produced by these Pseudovibrio isolates exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of clinical pathogens, while TDA tolerance was frequent in non-TDA producing marine isolates. Comparative genomics analysis suggested a high degree of conservation among the tda biosynthetic clusters while expression studies revealed coordinated regulation of TDA synthesis upon transition from log to stationary phase growth, which was not induced by TDA itself or by the presence of the C10-acyl homoserine lactone quorum sensing signal molecule. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Antimicrobial; Clinical; Marine; Pseudovibrio; TDA","antiinfective agent; tropodithietic acid; unclassified drug; antiinfective agent; tropodithietic acid; tropolone; antibacterial activity; antibiotic biosynthesis; Article; Axinella; Axinella dissimilis; bacterial gene; bacterial genome; bacterial strain; bacterium isolate; controlled study; culture medium; gene induction; genetic conservation; genome analysis; Haliclona; Haliclona simulans; marine bacterium; nonhuman; Polymastia boletiformis; Pseudovibrio; sponge (Porifera); tdaA gene; tdaB gene; tdaC gene; tdaD gene; tdaE gene; tdaF gene; analogs and derivatives; animal; chemistry; Pseudovibrio; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Porifera; Tropolone",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

They function as transcriptional regulators to control expression of genes involved in development, homeostasis, and metabolism. The number of NRs differs from species to species, because of gene duplications and/or lineage-specific gene losses during metazoan evolution. Many NRs in arthropods interact with the ecdysteroid hormone and are involved in ecdysone-mediated signaling in arthropods. The nuclear receptor superfamily complement has been reported in several arthropods, including crustaceans, but not in copepods. We identified the entire NR repertoire of the copepod Tigriopus japonicus, which is an important marine model species for ecotoxicology and environmental genomics. Results: Using whole genome and transcriptome sequences, we identified a total of 31 nuclear receptors in the genome of T. japonicus. Nomenclature of the nuclear receptors was determined based on the sequence similarities of the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and ligand-binding domain (LBD). The 7 subfamilies of NRs separate into five major clades (subfamilies NR1, NR2, NR3, NR4, and NR5/6). Although the repertoire of NR members in, T. japonicus was similar to that reported for other arthropods, there was an expansion of the NR1 subfamily in Tigriopus japonicus. The twelve unique nuclear receptors identified in T. japonicus are members of NR1L. This expansion may be a unique lineage-specific feature of crustaceans. Interestingly, E78 and HR83, which are present in other arthropods, were absent from the genomes of T. japonicus and two congeneric copepod species (T. japonicus and Tigriopus californicus), suggesting copepod lineage-specific gene loss. Conclusions: We identified all NR receptors present in the copepod, T. japonicus. Knowledge of the copepod nuclear receptor repertoire will contribute to a better understanding of copepod- and crustacean-specific NR evolution. © 2014 Hwang et al.","Copepod; Ecdysone signaling; Nuclear receptor","cell nucleus receptor; cell receptor; Article; cladistics; controlled study; copepod; DNA binding domain; gene; gene identification; gene loss; gene nomenclature; gene sequence; genetic parameters; genetic similarity; genome analysis; ligand binding domain; nonhuman; NR1 gene; NR2 gene; NR3 gene; NR4 gene; NR5 gene; NR6 gene; nuclear receptor gene; nucleotide sequence; phylogenetic tree; sequence analysis; Tigriopus californicus; Tigriopus japonicus; animal; chemistry; Chordata; copepod; genetics; genome; multigene family; nomenclature; phylogeny; protein tertiary structure; species difference; Arthropoda; Copepoda; Crustacea; Metazoa; Tigriopus californicus; Tigriopus japonicus; Animals; Chordata; Copepoda; Genome; Multigene Family; Phylogeny; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear; Species Specificity; Terminology as Topic",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

These associations have evolved multiple times in marine habitats, such as deep-sea hydrothermal vents and reducing sediments, characterized by steep gradients of oxygen and reduced chemicals. Due to difficulties associated with maintaining these symbioses in the laboratory and culturing the symbiotic bacteria, studies of chemosynthetic symbioses rely heavily on culture independent methods. The symbiosis between the coastal bivalve, Solemya velum, and its intracellular symbiont is a model for chemosynthetic symbioses given its accessibility in intertidal environments and the ability to maintain it under laboratory conditions. To better understand this symbiosis, the genome of the S. velum endosymbiont was sequenced. Results: Relative to the genomes of obligate symbiotic bacteria, which commonly undergo erosion and reduction, the S. velum symbiont genome was large (2.7 Mb), GC-rich (51%), and contained a large number (78) of mobile genetic elements. Comparative genomics identified sets of genes specific to the chemosynthetic lifestyle and necessary to sustain the symbiosis. In addition, a number of inferred metabolic pathways and cellular processes, including heterotrophy, branched electron transport, and motility, suggested that besides the ability to function as an endosymbiont, the bacterium may have the capacity to live outside the host. Conclusions: The physiological dexterity indicated by the genome substantially improves our understanding of the genetic and metabolic capabilities of the S. velum symbiont and the breadth of niches the partners may inhabit during their lifecycle. © 2014 Dmytrenko et al.","Calvin cycle; Chemosynthesis; H+/Na+ -membrane cycles; Heterotrophy; Mobile genetic elements; Motility; Pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase; Respiratory flexibility; Sulfur oxidation; Symbiosis","proton transporting adenosine triphosphate synthase; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) dehydrogenase (quinone); transfer RNA; transposon; amino acid synthesis; Article; autotrophy; bacterial genome; bacterial membrane; bacterial metabolism; bivalve; carbon dioxide fixation; carbon fixation; carbon metabolism; chemolithotrophy; DNA base composition; electron transport; gene structure; heterotrophy; intracellular bacterium; membrane transport; mobile genetic element; nitrogen fixation; nitrogen metabolism; nonhuman; oxidation; Solemya velum; symbiosis; twitching motility; urea cycle; animal; bacterial gene; bivalve; ecosystem; genetics; intracellular space; metabolism; microbiology; molecular genetics; oxidation reduction reaction; transposon; Animals; Base Composition; Bivalvia; DNA Transposable Elements; Ecosystem; Genes, Bacterial; Genome, Bacterial; Intracellular Space; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Molecular Sequence Data; Oxidation-Reduction; RNA, Transfer; Symbiosis",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Marine fishes are valuable organisms for advancing our understanding of evolution on historical and contemporary time scales, and here we highlight areas in which research on these species is likely to be particularly important in the near future. These include possibilities for gaining insights into processes on ecological time scales, identifying genomic signatures associated with population divergence under gene flow, and determining the genetic basis of phenotypic traits. We also consider future challenges pertaining to the implementation of genome-wide coverage through next-generation sequencing and genotyping methods in marine fishes. Complications associated with fast decay of linkage disequilibrium, as expected for species with large effective population sizes, and the possibility that adaptation is associated with both soft selective sweeps and polygenic selection, leaving complex genomic signatures in natural populations, are likely to challenge future studies. However, the combination of high genome coverage and new statistical developments offers promising solutions. Thus, the next generation of studies is likely to truly facilitate the transition from population genetics to population genomics in marine fishes. This transition will advance our understanding of basic evolutionary processes and will offer new possibilities for conservation and management of valuable marine resources. © 2014 Marine Biological Laboratory.",,"adaptation; conservation management; divergence; effective population size; facilitation; fish; gene flow; generation time; genomics; genotype; marine environment; phenotype; selection; timescale; Pisces; animal; aquatic species; evolution; fish; genetics; metagenomics; standards; trends; Animals; Aquatic Organisms; Biological Evolution; Fishes; Metagenomics",Review,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

The future of the biopharmaceutical holds great promise due to the many compounds that have and will be isolated from marine sources. Marine organisms have long been recognized as a source of novel metabolites with applications in human disease therapy. The marine environment is a rich source of both biological and chemical diversity, where it has been reported that oceans contain nearly 300,000 described species, representing only a small percentage of the total number of species that have to be discovered. The ocean represents a rich resource for ever more novel compounds with great potential as pharmaceutical, nutritional supplements, cosmetics, agrichemicals and enzymes, where each of these marine bioproducts has a strong potential market value. The reasons for the strong showing of drug discovery from natural products can be attributed to the diverse structures, intricate carbon skeletons, and the ease that human bodies will accept these molecules with minimal manipulation. With new pressures from the public and governments around the world to develop products to combat diseases and infections commonly encountered, new chemical entities need to be found and developed. Today, the structures of around 1,40,000 secondary metabolites have been elucidated. But, owing to technical improvements in screening programmes, and separation and isolation techniques, the number of natural compounds discovered exceeds one million. This paper deals with the sources of drugs, discovery, isolation, identification, strain improvement, and its socio economic problems from marine sources. Detailed accounts are also given on novel marine metabolites, which were isolated from different (sponges, fishes, mollusks, cones, seaweeds and microorganisms) sources. Apart from that, we covered the role of natural products in disease treatment and commercial utilization of these compounds for possible drug improvement using advanced (metabolic engineering, post-genomics) approaches. The main challenge for future new drugs from the sea remains supply, but with production by fermentation and aquaculture two promising solutions are presented. © 2012 Capital Publishing Company.

We investigated the transcriptomes of two marine planktonic ciliates, the mixotrophic oligotrich Strombidium rassoulzadegani and the heterotrophic choreotrich Strombidinopsis sp., and their respective algal food using Illumina RNAseq. Our aim was to characterize the transcriptomes of these contrasting ciliates and to identify genes potentially involved in mixotrophy. We detected approximately 10,000 and 7,600 amino acid sequences for S. rassoulzadegani and Strombidinopsis sp., respectively. About half of these transcripts had significant BLASTP hits (E-value &lt;10-6) against previously-characterized sequences, mostly from the model ciliate Oxytricha trifallax. Transcriptomes from both the mixotroph and the heterotroph species provided similar annotations for GO terms and KEGG pathways. Most of the identified genes were related to housekeeping activity and pathways such as the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, nucleotides, and vitamins. Although S. rassoulzadegani can keep and use chloroplasts from its prey, we did not find genes clearly linked to chloroplast maintenance and functioning in the transcriptome of this ciliate. While chloroplasts are known sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS), we found the same complement of antioxidant pathways in both ciliates, except for one enzyme possibly linked to ascorbic acid recycling found exclusively in the mixotroph. Contrary to our expectations, we did not find qualitative differences in genes potentially related to mixotrophy. However, these transcriptomes will help to establish a basis for the evaluation of differential gene expression in oligotrichs and choreotrichs and experimental investigation of the costs and benefits of mixotrophy. © 2014 Santoferrara et al.",,"transcriptome; transcriptome; amino acid metabolism; amino acid sequence; article; carbohydrate metabolism; chloroplast; ciliate; controlled study; gene identification; heterotrophy; housekeeping gene; lipid metabolism; mixotrophy; nonhuman; nucleotide metabolism; Oxytricha trifallax; Strombidinopsis; Strombidium rassoulzadegani; transcriptomics; vitamin metabolism; animal; ciliate; genetics; metabolism; physiology; zooplankton; Animals; Ciliophora; Transcriptome; Zooplankton",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

The analysis, toxicology, synthesis and degradation of the highly polar amino acid DA and its kainoid congeners are discussed in this chapter. Although DA is structurally simple and ubiquitous in contaminated food samples, it was not simple to prove that it was the causative agent of ASP in humans and of DA poisoning in carnivorous birds and mammals. Furthermore, its detection and the prevention of ASP requires regular monitoring of seafood using rapid and accurate analyses. The main producers of DA are certain seasonally blooming diatoms of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia, major components of coastal phytoplankton. Here, details are provided of the species most likely to be involved in food-poisoning episodes, together with a brief account of the molecular mechanisms that underlie DA toxicity, which cause symptoms of acute and chronic neurotoxicity. DA may attain critically toxic levels within two major food chains involving benthic filter-feeders (e.g., mussels) or planktivorous fish (e.g., anchovies). Preventive measures must be complemented by risk assessments of seasonal toxigenic blooms, especially in nutrient-enriched coastal areas. The major chemical and biotic factors that influence diatom bloom formation and toxigenicity are outlined.

Most isolates required sea water for growth, suggesting them being adapted to the marine environment. Phylogenetic analysis of Streptomyces spp. revealed two isolates that originated from different sponges and had 99.7% identity in their 16S rRNA gene sequences, indicating that they represent very closely related strains.

Genetic studies, especially on the chromosomal sex-determining system of this species, have been carried out in the last decade. Although the genome of half-smooth tongue sole was relatively small (626.9 Mb), there are still some difficulties in the high-quality assembly of the next generation genome sequencing reads without the assistance of a physical map, especially for the W chromosome of this fish due to abundance of repetitive sequences. The objective of this study is to construct a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-based physical map for half-smooth tongue sole with the method of high information content fingerprinting (HICF).Results: A physical map of half-smooth tongue sole was constructed with 30, 294 valid fingerprints (7.5 × genome coverage) with a tolerance of 4 and an initial cutoff of 1e-60. A total of 29,709 clones were assembled into 1,485 contigs with an average length of 539 kb and a N50 length of 664 kb. There were 394 contigs longer than the N50 length, and these contigs will be a useful resource for future integration with linkage map and whole genome sequence assembly. The estimated physical length of the assembled contigs was 797 Mb, representing approximately 1.27 coverage of the half-smooth tongue sole genome. The largest contig contained 410 BAC clones with a physical length of 3.48 Mb. Almost all of the 676 BAC clones (99.9%) in the 21 randomly selected contigs were positively validated by PCR assays, thereby confirming the reliability of the assembly.Conclusions: A first generation BAC-based physical map of half-smooth tongue sole was constructed with high reliability. The map will promote genetic improvement programs of this fish, especially integration of physical and genetic maps, fine-mappings of important gene and/or QTL, comparative and evolutionary genomics studies, as well as whole genome sequence assembly. © 2014 Zhang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","BAC library; Cynoglossus semilaevis; Genome; Half-smooth tongue sole; Physical map","article; bacterial artificial chromosome; contig mapping; DNA fingerprinting; flatfish; gene mapping; genetic improvement; genetic procedures; genome analysis; genome size; half smooth tongue sole; high information content fingerprinting; linkage analysis; molecular cloning; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; quantitative trait locus mapping; reliability; Animals; Chromosomes, Artificial, Bacterial; Computational Biology; Contig Mapping; DNA Fingerprinting; Female; Fishes; Genome; Genomics; Male; Physical Chromosome Mapping; Reproducibility of Results",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Although many studies have examined the ecological effects of heat stress on mussels, little is known about the physiological mechanisms that maybe affected by co-exposure to heat stress and environmental contaminants such as nickel (Ni). In the present work, we investigated the effects of simultaneous changes in temperature and Ni supply on lysosomal membrane stability (LMS) and malondialdehyde accumulation (MDA) in the digestive gland (DG) of the blue mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis (Lam.). To elucidate how the molecular response to environmental stressors is modulated, we employed a cDNA microarray with 1673 sequences to measure relative transcript abundances in the DG of mussels exposed to Ni along with a temperature increase. A two-way ANOVA revealed that temperature and Ni rendered additive effects on LMS and MDA accumulation, increasing the toxic effects of metal cations. Ni loads in the DG were also affected by co-exposure to 26. °C. In animals exposed only to heat stress, functional genomics analysis of the microarray data (171differentially expressed genes (DEGs)) highlighted seven biological processes, largely dominated by the up-regulation of folding protein-related genes and the down-regulation of genes involved in cell migration and cellular component assembly. Exposure to Ni at 18. °C and 26. °C yielded 188 and 262 DEGs, respectively, exhibiting distinct patterns in terms of biological processes. In particular, the response of mussels exposed to Ni at 26. °C was characterized by the up-regulation of proteolysis, ribosome biogenesis, response to unfolded proteins, and catabolic-related genes, as well as the down-regulation of genes encoding cellular metabolic processes. Our data provide new insights into the transcriptomic response in mussels experiencing temperature increases and Ni exposure; these data should be carefully considered in view of the biological effects of heat stress, particularly in polluted areas. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Heat stress; Mytilus galloprovincialis; Nickel; Transcriptomics","malonaldehyde; nickel; bivalve; cation; environmental stress; gene expression; genomics; nickel; physiology; pollution effect; pollution exposure; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; bioaccumulation; biogenesis; cell metabolism; cell migration; controlled study; down regulation; environmental exposure; exocrine gland; female; functional genomics; gene expression; heat stress; lysosome membrane; membrane stabilization; Mytilus galloprovincialis; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; oxidative stress; priority journal; protein degradation; ribosome; transcriptomics; unfolded protein response; unindexed sequence; upregulation; Heat stress; Mytilus galloprovincialis; Nickel; Transcriptomics; Animals; Hot Temperature; Mytilus; Nickel; Protein Folding; Proteolysis; Ribosomes; Stress, Physiological; Transcriptome; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"",Scopus

While, on average, more than one-tenth of protein N-termini are incorrectly annotated, there is a crucial need for methodological approaches to systematically establish the translational starts of polypeptides, and their maturations, such as N-terminal methionine processing and peptide signal excision. Refinement of genome annotation through correction of wrongly annotation initiation start site and detection of unannotated genes can be achieved after enrichment and detection of protein N-termini by mass spectrometry. Here we describe a straightforward strategy to specifically label protein N-termini with a positively charged TMPP label to selectively capture these entities with in-house-developed anti-TMPP antibodies coupled to magnetic beads and to analyze them by nanoLC-MS/MS. While most N-terminomics-oriented approaches are based on the depletion of internal peptides to retrieve N-terminal peptides, this enrichment approach is fast and the results are highly specific for improved, ionizable, TMPP-labeled peptides. The whole proteome of the model marine bacterium, Roseobacter denitrificans, was analyzed, leading to the identification of more than twice the number of N-terminal peptides compared with the nonenriched fraction. A total of 269 proteins were characterized in terms of their N-termini. In addition, three unannotated genes were identified based on multiple, redundant N-terminal peptides. Our strategy greatly simplifies the systematic and automatic proteogenomic annotation of genomes as well as degradomics-oriented approaches, focusing the mass spectrometric efforts on the most crucial enriched fractions. © 2013 American Chemical Society.","genome annotation; high-throughput proteomics; N-terminomics; protein derivatization; proteogenomics; tandem mass spectrometry","Animals; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Immunomagnetic Separation; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Peptides; Tandem Mass Spectrometry",Article,"",Scopus

Biogeochemical models, however, are trailing in the wake of the environmental genomics revolution, and such models rarely incorporate explicit representations of bacteria and archaea, nor are they compatible with nucleic acid or protein sequence data. Here, we present a functional gene-based framework for describing microbial communities in biogeochemical models by incorporating genomics data to provide predictions that are readily testable. To demonstrate the approach in practice, nitrogen cycling in the Arabian Sea oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) was modeled to examine key questions about cryptic sulfur cycling and dinitrogen production pathways in OMZs. Simulations support previous assertions that denitrification dominates over anammox in the central Arabian Sea, which has important implications for the loss of fixed nitrogen from the oceans. Furthermore, cryptic sulfur cycling was shown to attenuate the secondary nitrite maximum often observed in OMZs owing to changes in the composition of the chemolithoautotrophic community and dominant metabolic pathways. Results underscore the need to explicitly integrate microbes into biogeochemical models rather than just the metabolisms they mediate. By directly linking geochemical dynamics to the genetic composition of microbial communities, the method provides a framework for achieving mechanistic insights into patterns and biogeochemical consequences of marine microbes. Such an approach is critical for informing our understanding of the key role microbes play in modulating Earth's biogeochemistry.",,"nitrite; oxygen; sulfur; Arabian Sea; article; biogeochemistry; metabolism; metagenomics; microbial community; nitrogen cycling; nonhuman; prediction; priority journal; sea; sulfur cycle; Computer Simulation; Genes; Hydrogen Sulfide; Metagenomics; Models, Biological; Nitrates; Nitrogen Cycle; Oceans and Seas; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxygen",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus

Metagenomic analyses of members of the uncultured SUP05 lineage in the Canadian seasonally anoxic fjord Saanich Inlet (SI), hydrothermal plumes in the Guaymas Basin (GB) and single cell genomics analysis of two ARCTIC96BD-19 representatives from the South Atlantic Sub-Tropical Gyre (SASG) have shown them to be metabolically versatile. However, SI and GB SUP05 bacteria seem to be obligate chemolithoautotrophs, whereas ARCTIC96BD-19 has the genetic potential for aerobic respiration. Here, we present results of a metagenomic analysis of sulfur-oxidizing γ-proteobacteria (GSO), closely related to the SUP05/ARCTIC96BD-19 clade, from a coastal ecosystem in the eastern South Pacific (ESP). This ecosystem experiences seasonal anoxia and accumulation of nitrite and ammonium at depth, with a corresponding increase in the abundance of GSO representatives. The ESP-GSOs appear to have a significantly different gene complement than those from SI, GB, and SASG. Genomic analyses of de novo assembled contigs indicate the presence of a complete aerobic respiratory complex based on the cytochrome bc1 oxidase. Furthermore, they appear to encode a complete TCA cycle and several transporters for dissolved organic carbon species, suggesting a mixotrophic lifestyle. Thus, the success of sulfur-oxidizing γ-proteobacteria in oxygen-deficient marine ecosystems appears due not only to their previously recognized anaerobic metabolic versatility, but also to their capacity to function under aerobic conditions using different carbon sources. Finally, members of ESP-GSO cluster also have the genetic potential for reducing nitrate to ammonium based on the nirBD genes, and may therefore facilitate a tighter coupling of the nitrogen and sulfur cycles in oxygen-deficient waters. © 2014 Murillo, Ramírez-Flandes, DeLong and Ulloa.","ESP-GSO; Metagenomic analysis; OMZ; Sulfur oxidizers; SUP05",,Article,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus

Specifically, I apply a suite of tests for selection to a set of closely-related bacterial genomes with different microhabitat preferences within the marine water column, shedding light on the genomic mechanisms of ecological differentiation in the wild.

They are employed to characterize ecological communities circumventing uncertainties and challenges associated with the conventional techniques of taxonomy employed to characterize these communities. Examples come from identifications of fishes and phytoplankton to monitoring of harmful algae. Although DNA microchips support a great diversity of applications and provide a wealth of findings in functional genomics and environmental studies, limits in ecological applications are known. So far, DNA microarrays used in biodiversity studies provide only qualitative data in terms of presence or absence of the species and its usage is greatly limited in providing the quantitative measurement of environmental samples. Moreover, DNA microarrays are commonly restricted to identify only those species that are targeted by the probes implemented on the chip. In turn, developing a broad spectrum array has technological challenges in terms of probe designing, experimental optimization, and statistical analysis. In this book chapter, we provide a critical assessment on promises and pitfalls of DNA microarrays as tool for marine invertebrate species identification. We implemented a DNA-chip prototype to identify 15 species of marine invertebrates from European Seas, including crustaceans, molluscs, and polychaetes, based on the two mitochondrial markers, cytochrome oxidase subunit I and 16S rRNA. Challenges involved in oligonucleotide probe design, in silico evaluation, and difficulties encountered through hybridization experiments are here explored. Specificity and sensitivity of the probes have also been critically evaluated to verify the suitability of the selected markers for microarray probe design. Since the ultimate application of DNA microarray to resolve complex environmental samples is a major challenge, we made an attempt to analyze gut contents of predator fishes. The problems encountered during this analysis, as the presence of target and not target species that could affect the specificity and the sensitivity of the DNA-chip to distinguish low and high abundant target species from a background of non-targets, were explored. We also reviewed advantages and disadvantages of DNA microarray technology compared to other molecular identification methods such as DNA barcoding and next generation sequencing. The outcome of the Invertebrate DNA Chip prototype served as a proof-of-concept for the identification of selected marine invertebrates and prey species of demersal fishes by DNA microarray. The potential of such microarrays can encompass several fields of scientific applications in marine biodiversity and ecosystem sciences, as marine ecosystem diversity and environmental monitoring, seafood quality control, and understanding food webs and ecosystem functioning. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

However, the distribution and functional diversity of CRISPRs among environmental bacteria remains largely unknown. Here, comparative genomics of 75 Salinispora strains provided insight into the diversity and distribution of CRISPR-Cas systems in a cosmopolitan marine actinomycete genus. Results: CRISPRs were found in all Salinispora strains, with the majority containing multiple loci and different Cas array subtypes. Of the six subtypes identified, three have not been previously described. A lower prophage frequency in S. arenicola was associated with a higher fraction of spacers matching Salinispora prophages compared to S. tropica, suggesting differing defensive capacities between Salinispora species. The occurrence of related prophages in strains from distant locations, as well as spacers matching those prophages inserted throughout spacer arrays, indicate recurring encounters with widely distributed phages over time. Linkages of CRISPR features with Salinispora microdiversity pointed to subclade-specific contacts with mobile genetic elements (MGEs). This included lineage-specific spacer deletions or insertions, which may reflect weak selective pressures to maintain immunity or distinct temporal interactions with MGEs, respectively. Biogeographic patterns in spacer and prophage distributions support the concept that Salinispora spp. encounter localized MGEs. Moreover, the presence of spacers matching housekeeping genes suggests that CRISPRs may have functions outside of viral defense. Conclusions: This study provides a comprehensive examination of CRISPR-Cas systems in a broadly distributed group of environmental bacteria. The ubiquity and diversity of CRISPRs in Salinispora suggests that CRISPR-mediated interactions with MGEs represent a major force in the ecology and evolution of this cosmopolitan marine actinomycete genus. © 2014 Wietz et al.","CRISPR-Cas; Evolution; Immunity; Mobile genetic elements; Prophages; Salinispora","Actinobacteria; Arenicola; biogeography; CRISPR Cas system; ecology; gene deletion; genus; housekeeping gene; immunity; major clinical study; nonhuman; prophage; species; bacterial gene; classification; genetic selection; genetic variability; genetics; interspersed repeat; Micromonosporaceae; phylogeography; physiology; prophage; virology; CRISPR-Cas Systems; Genes, Bacterial; Genetic Variation; Interspersed Repetitive Sequences; Micromonosporaceae; Phylogeography; Prophages; Selection, Genetic",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

It is the most important halogenated trace gas in the atmosphere, where it contributes to ozone destruction. Current estimates of the global CH3Cl budget are uncertain and suggest that microorganisms might play a more important role in degrading atmospheric CH3Cl than previously thought. Its degradation by bacteria has been demonstrated in marine, terrestrial and phyllospheric environments. Improving our knowledge of these degradation processes and its magnitude is thus highly relevant for a better understanding of the global budget of CH3Cl. The cmu pathway, for chloromethane utilisation, is the only microbial pathway for CH3Cl degradation elucidated so far, and was characterised in detail in aerobic methylotrophic Alphaproteobacteria. Here, we reveal the potential of using a two-pronged approach involving a combination of comparative genomics and isotopic fractionation during CH3Cl degradation to newly address the question of the diversity of chloromethane-degrading bacteria in the environment. Analysis of available bacterial genome sequences reveals that several bacteria not yet known to degrade CH3Cl contain part or all of the complement of cmu genes required for CH3Cl degradation. These organisms, unlike bacteria shown to grow with CH3Cl using the cmu pathway, are obligate anaerobes. On the other hand, analysis of the complete genome of the chloromethane-degrading bacterium Leisingera methylohalidivorans showed that this bacterium does not contain cmu genes. Isotope fractionation experiments with L. methylohalidivorans suggest that the unknown pathway used by this bacterium for growth with CH3Cl can be differentiated from the cmu pathway. This result opens the prospect that contributions from bacteria with the cmu and Leisingera-type pathways to the atmospheric CH3Cl budget may be teased apart in the future.",,"carbon; DNA; hydrogen; methyl chloride; tetrahydrofolic acid; Alphaproteobacteria; Article; Bacteria; bacterial growth; chloromethane utilisation gene; Deltaproteobacteria; Desulfomonile tiedjei; Desulfotomaculum; Desulfurispora thermophila; fractionation; gas chromatography; gene; genomics; Hyphomicrobium; Leisingera methylohalidivorans; Methylobacterium extorquens; microbial degradation; microbial diversity; nonhuman; Peptococcaceae; Rhodobacteraceae; Thermincola potens; Thermoanaerobacteriales; Thermosediminibacter oceani; Alphaproteobacteria; Bacteria (microorganisms); Leisingera; Leisingera methylohalidivorans",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Here we report the RNA sequencing of the mussel digestive gland, performed with the aim: a) to produce a high quality de novo transcriptome assembly, thus improving the genetic and molecular knowledge of this organism b) to provide an initial assessment of the response to paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) on a molecular level, in order to identify possible molecular markers of toxin accumulation. Results: The comprehensive de novo assembly and annotation of the transcriptome yielded a collection of 12,079 non-redundant consensus sequences with an average length of 958 bp, with a high percentage of full-length transcripts. The whole-transcriptome gene expression study indicated that the accumulation of paralytic toxins produced by the dinoflagellate Alexandrium minutum over a time span of 5 days scarcely affected gene expression, but the results need further validation with a greater number of biological samples and naturally contaminated specimens. Conclusion: The digestive gland reference transcriptome we produced significantly improves the data collected from previous sequencing efforts and provides a basic resource for expanding functional genomics investigations in M. galloprovincialis. Although not conclusive, the results of the RNA-seq gene expression analysis support the classification of mussels as bivalves refractory to paralytic shellfish poisoning and point out that the identification molecular biomarkers of PSP in the digestive gland of this organism is problematic. © 2014 Gerdol et al.","Alexandrium minutum; De novo assembly; Mytilus galloprovincialis; Paralytic shellfish poisoning; RNA-seq; Transcriptome","Alexandrium minutum; Bivalvia; Dinophyceae; Mytilus galloprovincialis; genetic marker; marine toxin; shellfish poisoning; transcriptome; anatomy and histology; animal; digestive system; dinoflagellate; environmental monitoring; food chain; gene expression profiling; genetic marker; genetics; high throughput sequencing; host parasite interaction; metabolism; Mytilus; parasitology; pathogenicity; procedures; protozoal infection; sequence analysis; Animals; Digestive System; Dinoflagellida; Environmental Monitoring; Food Chain; Gene Expression Profiling; Genetic Markers; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Host-Parasite Interactions; Marine Toxins; Mytilus; Protozoan Infections; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Shellfish Poisoning; Transcriptome",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Strain skB26 possessed a circular plasmid of 86.6-kbp in addition to its chromosome, and an approximate 18-kbp region of the plasmid was occupied by an arxA-like operon, encoding a new clade of anaerobic arsenite oxidase. Multilocus sequence analysis showed that strain skB26 could not be assigned to any existing order; thus a novel order, Sulfuricellales, is proposed. The genomes of strains skB26 and sk43H were examined, focusing on the composition and the phylogeny of genes involved in the oxidation of inorganic sulfur compounds. Strains skB26 and sk43H shared a common pathway, which consisted of Sqr, SoxEF, SoxXYZAB, Dsr proteins, AprBA, Sat, and SoeABC. Comparative genomics of betaproteobacterial sulfur oxidizers showed that this pathway was also shared by the freshwater sulfur oxidizers Thiobacillus denitrificans and Sideroxydans lithotrophicus.

The pipeline, written in BASH, uses data reduction techniques and other stand-alone software packages to perform quality trimming and adapter removal, de novo assembly of RAD loci, read mapping, SNP and Indel calling, and baseline data filtering. Double-digest RAD data from population pairings of three different marine fishes were used to compare dDocent with Stacks, the first generally available, widely used pipeline for analysis of RADseq data. dDocent consistently identified more SNPs shared across greater numbers of individuals and with higher levels of coverage. This is due to the fact that dDocent quality trims instead of filtering, incorporates both forward and reverse reads (including reads with INDEL polymorphisms) in assembly, mapping, and SNP calling.

Streptomyces strain SM8 extracts showed antibacterial and antifungal activity. NMR analysis of the active fractions proved that hydroxylated saturated fatty acids were the major components present in the antibacterial fractions. Antimycin compounds were initially putatively identified in the antifungal fractions using LC-Orbitrap. Their presence was later confirmed by comparison to a standard. Genomic analysis of Streptomyces sp.

Compared with their cultured relatives, they frequently exhibit a streamlined genome, reduced G+C content and distinct gene repertoire. These genomic traits are relevant to environmental adaptation, and have generally been thought to become fixed in marine bacterial populations through selection. Using single-cell genomics, we sequenced four uncultivated cells affiliated with the ecologically relevant Roseobacter clade and used a composition-heterogeneous Bayesian phylogenomic model to resolve these single-cell genomes into a new clade. This lineage has no representatives in culture, yet accounts for ∼35% of Roseobacters in some surface ocean waters. Analyses of multiple genomic traits, including genome size, G+C content and percentage of noncoding DNA, suggest that these single cells are representative of oceanic Roseobacters but divergent from isolates. Population genetic analyses showed that substitution of physicochemically dissimilar amino acids and replacement of G+C-rich to G+C-poor codons are accelerated in the uncultivated clade, processes that are explained equally well by genetic drift as by the more frequently invoked explanation of natural selection.

In multicellular organisms clocks are found at multiple levels from cells to organs and whole organisms, making the study of clock mechanisms more complex. In recent years the picoalga Ostreococcus has emerged as a new circadian model organism thanks to its reduced gene redundancy and its minimalist cellular organization. A simplified version of the ""green"" plant clock, involving the master clock genes TOC1 and CCA1, has been revealed when the functional genomics and mathematical model approaches were combined.Specific photoreceptors such as a blue light sensing LOV histidine kinase mediate light input to the Ostreococcus clock.

It has been proposed that bacteria producing photoactive iron binding compounds known as siderophores could play an important role in such mutualistic associations by producing bioavailable iron utilizable by phytoplankton and in exchange receive autotrophically derived DOM. In order to understand the potential role photoactive siderophores might be playing in bacterial-algal mutualism or marine biogeochemistry in general, it is important to be able to detect and quantify their presence in various environments. One approach to accomplish that end is to make use of high sensitivity genomics technology (qPCR) to search for siderophore biosynthesis genes related to the production of photoactive siderophores. In this way one can access their ""biochemical potential"" and utilize this information as a proxy for the presence of these siderophores in the marine environment. In this report we studied the correlation of the presence of bacteria producing one of the three photoactive siderophores relative to total bacterial and dinoflagellate numbers from surface water at the Scripps Pier before, during, and after fall bloom of the dinoflagellate Lingulodinium polyedrum.

Identifying SNPs under natural selection and underpinning species adaptation relies on disentangling the respective contribution of random processes (mutation, drift, migration) from that of selection on nucleotide variability. Most theory and statistical tests have been developed using the Kingman coalescent theory based on the Wright-Fisher population model. However, these theoretical models rely on biological and life history assumptions which may be violated in many prokaryote, fungal, animal or plant species. Recent theoretical developments of the so-called multiple merger coalescent models are reviewed here (Λ-coalescent, beta-coalescent, Bolthausen-Sznitman, Ξ-coalescent). We explain how these new models take into account various pervasive ecological and biological characteristics, life history traits or life cycles which were not accounted in previous theories such as (i) the skew in offspring production typical of marine species, (ii) fast adapting microparasites (virus, bacteria and fungi) exhibiting large variation in population sizes during epidemics, (iii) the peculiar life cycles of fungi and bacteria alternating sexual and asexual cycles and (iv) the high rates of extinction-recolonization in spatially structured populations.

The isolation of diverse strains of Epsilonproteobacteria and the sequencing of their genomes have revealed that this group has the metabolic potential to occupy a wide range of niches, particularly at dynamic deep-sea hydrothermal vents. We expand on this body of work by examining the population genomics of six strains of Lebetimonas, a vent-endemic, thermophilic, hydrogen-oxidizing Epsilonproteobacterium, from a single seamount in the Mariana Arc. Using Lebetimonas as a model for anaerobic, moderately thermophilic organisms in the warm, anoxic subseafloor environment, we show that genomic content is highly conserved and that recombination is limited between closely related strains. The Lebetimonas genomes are shaped by mobile genetic elements and gene loss as well as the acquisition of novel functional genes by horizontal gene transfer, which provide the potential for adaptation and microbial speciation in the deep sea. In addition, these Lebetimonas genomes contain two operons of nitrogenase genes with different evolutionary origins. Lebetimonas expressed nifH during growth with nitrogen gas as the sole nitrogen source, thus providing the first evidence of nitrogen fixation in any Epsilonproteobacteria from deep-sea hydrothermal vents. In this study, we provide a comparative overview of the genomic potential within the Nautiliaceae as well as among more distantly related hydrothermal vent Epsilonproteobacteria to broaden our understanding of microbial adaptation and diversity in the deep sea. © 2014 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.","Epsilonproteobacteria; Hydrothermal vent; Population genomics; Seamount","bacterium; chemoautotrophy; deep-sea benthos; gene transfer; genetic variation; genome; genomics; hydrothermal vent; marine sediment; oxygen minimum layer; phylogenetics; population genetics; seafloor; seamount; volcanic eruption; Mariana Arc; Pacific Ocean; nitrogenase; RNA 16S; article; bacterial genome; classification; enzymology; Epsilonproteobacteria; gene flow; genetic recombination; genetic variability; genetics; genomic island; hydrothermal vent; isolation and purification; metagenomics; microbiology; nitrogen fixation; operon; phylogeny; Epsilonproteobacteria; Gene Flow; Genetic Variation; Genome, Bacterial; Genomic Islands; Hydrothermal Vents; Metagenomics; Nitrogen Fixation; Nitrogenase; Operon; Phylogeny; Recombination, Genetic; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus

The group emerged with a series of findings: (1) Marine population structure is complex, but single locus mtDNA studies continue to provide powerful first assessment of phylogeographic patterns. (2) These patterns gain greater significance/power when resolved in a diversity of taxa. New analytical tools are emerging to address these analyses with multi-taxon approaches. (3) Genome-wide analyses are warranted if selection is indicated by surveys of standard markers. Such indicators can include discordance between genetic loci, or between genetic loci and morphology. Phylogeographic information provides a valuable context for studies of selection and adaptation. (4) Phylogeographic inferences are greatly enhanced by an understanding of the biology and ecology of study organisms. (5) Thorough, range-wide sampling of taxa is the foundation for robust phylogeographic inference. (6) Congruent geographic and taxonomic sampling by the Indo- Pacific community of scientists would facilitate better comparative analyses. The group concluded that at this stage of technology and software development, judicious rather than wholesale application of genomics appears to be the most robust course for marine phylogeographic studies. Therefore, our group intends to affirm the value of traditional (""unplugged"") approaches, such as those based on mtDNA sequencing and microsatellites, along with essential field studies, in an era with increasing emphasis on genomic approaches.© 2014 Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science of the University of Miami.",,"community ecology; comparative study; mitochondrial DNA; phylogeography; research and development; North Carolina; United States",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

In this review, we synthesize the current knowledge of the invasion mechanisms and ecological impacts of Gracilaria vermiculophylla, a red agarophyte native to Asia Northwest Pacific, which now has become a rapid and successful coastal invader in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific Oceans. Eco-physiological and chemical studies have revealed that some ecological traits, including survival in dark condition (e.g. the ballast water), tolerance to grazing and extreme salinities and temperatures, insensitive to UVR and light intensity and nutrient levels, adaptation to a wide diversity of habitats, and chemical defense to potential predators, may provide G. vermiculophylla an unmatched advantage during its global invasion. The rapid growth, flexible reproduction through fragmentation, efficient recruitment on hard substratum, seeding success on various vectors, and interaction with local community organisms may also contribute to its rapid increase in abundance and effects on the invaded coastal ecosystems. G. vermiculophylla showed both negative and positive impacts to the marine ecosystems through changing interspecific competition, increasing habitat diversity, altering the community complex, and transforming biogeochemical cycles and estuarine food webs. Future surveys such as marine exotic genomics, transcriptome sequencing and epigenetic variation between native and invasive entities may provide insightful promise on molecular mechanisms of seaweed invasion. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Ecological consequences; Gracilaria vermiculophylla; Habitat modifier; Invasion mechanisms; Seaweed","adaptation; ballast water; biogeochemical cycle; biological invasion; community composition; conservation management; ecological impact; ecophysiology; genomics; growth rate; habitat type; invasive species; molecular analysis; red alga; seaweed; survival; tolerance; Atlantic Ocean; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (East); Pacific Ocean (Northwest)",Article,"",Scopus

More than 80 serotypes have been described worldwide, based on antigenic properties of the somatic (O) and capsular (K) antigens. Serovar O3:K6 emerged in India in 1996 and subsequently was isolated worldwide, leading to the conclusion that the first V. parahaemolyticus pandemic had taken place. Most strains of V. parahaemolyticus isolated from the environment or seafood, in contrast to clinical strains, do not produce a thermostable direct hemolysin (TDH) and/or a TDH-related hemolysin (TRH). Type 3 secretion systems (T3SSs), needle-like apparatuses able to deliver bacterial effectors into host cytoplasm, were identified as triggering cytotoxicity and enterotoxicity. Type 6 secretion systems (T6SS) predicted to be involved in intracellular trafficking and vesicular transport appear to play a role in V. parahaemolyticus virulence. Recent advances in V. parahaemolyticus genomics identified several pathogenicity islands (VpaIs) located on either chromosome in both epidemic and pandemic strains and comprising additional colonization factors, such as restriction-modification complexes, chemotaxis proteins, classical bacterial surface virulence factors, and putative colicins. Furthermore, studies indicate strains lacking toxins and genomic regions associated with pathogenicity may also be pathogenic, suggesting other important virulence factors remain to be identified. The unique repertoire of virulence factors identified to date, their occurrence and distribution in both epidemic and pandemic strains worldwide are described, with the aim of highlighting the complexity of V. parahaemolyticus pathogenicity as well as its dynamic genome. © 2013 Ceccarelli, Hasan, Huq and Colwell.","Epidemic strains; O3:K6; PAI; Pandemic strains; Tdh; Trh; V. parahaemolyticus; Virulence markers","hemolysin; marker; virulence factor; virus protein; virulence factor; protirelin; chemotaxis; chromosome 1; chromosome 2; dynamics; ecological niche; epidemic; gastroenteritis; gene transfer; genome; geographic distribution; human; microbial colonization; nonhuman; pandemic; pathogenicity; review; sequence homology; Vibrio parahaemolyticus; Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection; bacterial secretion system; genetics; genomic island; health; microbiology; Vibrio Infections; epidemic strains; genetics; microbiology; O3:K6; PAI; pandemic strains; tdh; V. parahaemolyticus; Vibrio parahaemolyticus; vibriosis; virulence markers; Bacterial Secretion Systems; Genomic Islands; Global Health; Pandemics; Vibrio Infections; Vibrio parahaemolyticus; Virulence Factors; epidemic strains; O3:K6; PAI; pandemic strains; tdh; trh; V. parahaemolyticus; virulence markers; Bacterial Secretion Systems; Genomic Islands; Pandemics; Vibrio Infections; Vibrio parahaemolyticus; Virulence Factors; World Health",Review,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Although the application of genomics to marine biodiversity remains poorly developed overall, some noteworthy progress has been made in recent years. The genomes of various model marine organisms have been published and a few more are underway. In addition, the recent large-scale analysis of marine microbes, along with transcriptomic and proteomic approaches to the study of teleost fishes, mollusks and crustaceans, to mention a few, has provided a better understanding of phenotypic variability and functional genomics. The past few years have also seen advances in applications relevant to marine aquaculture and fisheries.

They play a critical role in the biology of their hosts and in ecosystem functioning at large. The classical approaches studying phages require isolation from a pure culture of the host. Direct sequencing approaches have been hampered by the small amounts of phage DNA present in most natural habitats and the difficulty in applying meta-omic approaches, such as annotation of small reads and assembly. Serendipitously, it has been discovered that cellular metagenomes of highly productive ocean waters (the deep chlorophyll maximum) contain significant amounts of viral DNA derived from cells undergoing the lytic cycle. We have taken advantage of this phenomenon to retrieve metagenomic fosmids containing viral DNA from a Mediterranean deep chlorophyll maximum sample. This method allowed description of complete genomes of 208 new marine phages. The diversity of these genomes was remarkable, contributing 21 genomic groups of tailed bacteriophages of which 10 are completely new. Sequence based methods have allowed host assignment to many of them. These predicted hosts represent a wide variety of important marine prokaryotic microbes like members of SAR11 and SAR116 clades, Cyanobacteria and also the newly described low GC Actinobacteria. A metavirome constructed from the same habitat showed that many of the new phage genomes were abundantly represented. Furthermore, other available metaviromes also indicated that some of the new phages are globally distributed in low to medium latitude ocean waters. The availability of many genomes from the same sample allows a direct approach to viral population genomics confirming the remarkable mosaicism of phage genomes. © 2013 Mizuno et al.",,"chlorophyll; contig; virus DNA; article; bacteriophage; cladistics; controlled study; fosmid; genetic variability; host selection; marine species; metagenomics; nonhuman; prediction; sequence analysis; species diversity; virus genome; virus isolation; Actinobacteria; Bacteriophages; Cyanobacteria; DNA, Viral; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Metagenomics; Molecular Sequence Data; Prokaryotic Cells; Seawater; Sequence Analysis, DNA",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Here we used single-cell genomics to obtain comprehensive insights into the metabolic potential of individual poribacterial cells representing three distinct phylogenetic groups within Poribacteria. Genome sizes were up to 5.4 Mbp and genome coverage was as high as 98.5%. Common features of the poribacterial genomes indicated that heterotrophy is likely to be of importance for this bacterial candidate phylum. Carbohydrate-active enzyme database screening and further detailed analysis of carbohydrate metabolism suggested the ability to degrade diverse carbohydrate sources likely originating from seawater and from the host itself. the presence of uronic acid degradation pathways as well as several specific sulfatases provides strong support that Poribacteria degrade glycosaminoglycan chains of proteoglycans, which are important components of the sponge host matrix. Dominant glycoside hydrolase families further suggest degradation of other glycoproteins in the host matrix. We therefore propose that Poribacteria are well adapted to an existence in the sponge extracellular matrix.

The nine-spined stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) is a closely related species of the ecological 'supermodel' three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). It is an emerging model system for evolutionary biology research but has garnered less attention and lacks extensive genomic resources. To expand on these resources and aid the study of sticklebacks in a phylogenetic framework, we characterized nine-spined stickleback transcriptomes from brain and liver using deep sequencing.Results: We obtained nearly eight thousand assembled transcripts, of which 3,091 were assigned as putative one-to-one orthologs to genes found in the three-spined stickleback. These sequences were used for evaluating overall differentiation and substitution rates between nine- and three-spined sticklebacks, and to identify genes that are putatively evolving under positive selection. The synonymous substitution rate was estimated to be 7.1 × 10-9 per site per year between the two species, and a total of 165 genes showed patterns of adaptive evolution in one or both species. A few nine-spined stickleback contigs lacked an obvious ortholog in three-spined sticklebacks but were found to match genes in other fish species, suggesting several gene losses within 13 million years since the divergence of the two stickleback species. We identified 47 SNPs in 25 different genes that differentiate pond and marine ecotypes. We also identified 468 microsatellites that could be further developed as genetic markers in nine-spined sticklebacks.Conclusion: With deep sequencing of nine-spined stickleback cDNA libraries, our study provides a significant increase in the number of gene sequences and microsatellite markers for this species, and identifies a number of genes showing patterns of adaptive evolution between nine- and three-spined sticklebacks. We also report several candidate genes that might be involved in differential adaptation between marine and freshwater nine-spined sticklebacks. This study provides a valuable resource for future studies aiming to identify candidate genes underlying ecological adaptation in this and other stickleback species. © 2013 Guo et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Adaptive evolution; Comparative genomics; Gasterosteus aculeatus; Pungitus pungitius; Substitution rate; Transcriptome","complementary DNA; microsatellite DNA; transcriptome; amino acid sequence; article; brain tissue; contig mapping; DNA library; DNA modification; evolutionary adaptation; Gasterosteus aculeatus; gene identification; gene location; gene loss; gene number; gene sequence; genetic analysis; genetic marker; genetic selection; genetic variability; liver; marine environment; microsatellite marker; molecular evolution; nonhuman; orthology; phylogeny; pond; Pungitius pungitius; RNA sequence; species differentiation; stickleback; substitution line; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Evolution, Molecular; Genetic Variation; Genome; Microsatellite Repeats; Phylogeny; Smegmamorpha; Species Specificity",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

The volume and complexity of such data leads to significant challenges in terms of its analysis, especially when one seeks to generate hypotheses or explore the underlying biological processes. At the state-of-the-art, the application of automated algorithms followed by perusal and analysis of the results by an expert continues to be the predominant paradigm for analyzing biological data. This paradigm works well in many problem domains. However, it also is limiting, since domain experts are forced to apply their instincts and expertise such as contextual reasoning, hypothesis formulation, and exploratory analysis after the algorithm has produced its results. In many areas where the organization and interaction of the biological processes is poorly understood and exploratory analysis is crucial, what is needed is to integrate domain expertise during the data analysis process and use it to drive the analysis itself.Results: In context of the aforementioned background, the results presented in this paper describe advancements along two methodological directions. First, given the context of biological data, we utilize and extend a design approach called experiential computing from multimedia information system design. This paradigm combines information visualization and human-computer interaction with algorithms for exploratory analysis of large-scale and complex data. In the proposed approach, emphasis is laid on: (1) allowing users to directly visualize, interact, experience, and explore the data through interoperable visualization-based and algorithmic components, (2) supporting unified query and presentation spaces to facilitate experimentation and exploration, (3) providing external contextual information by assimilating relevant supplementary data, and (4) encouraging user-directed information visualization, data exploration, and hypotheses formulation. Second, to illustrate the proposed design paradigm and measure its efficacy, we describe two prototype web applications. The first, called XMAS (Experiential Microarray Analysis System) is designed for analysis of time-series transcriptional data. The second system, called PSPACE (Protein Space Explorer) is designed for holistic analysis of structural and structure-function relationships using interactive low-dimensional maps of the protein structure space. Both these systems promote and facilitate human-computer synergy, where cognitive elements such as domain knowledge, contextual reasoning, and purpose-driven exploration, are integrated with a host of powerful algorithmic operations that support large-scale data analysis, multifaceted data visualization, and multi-source information integration.Conclusions: The proposed design philosophy, combines visualization, algorithmic components and cognitive expertise into a seamless processing-analysis-exploration framework that facilitates sense-making, exploration, and discovery. Using XMAS, we present case studies that analyze transcriptional data from two highly complex domains: gene expression in the placenta during human pregnancy and reaction of marine organisms to heat stress. With PSPACE, we demonstrate how complex structure-function relationships can be explored. These results demonstrate the novelty, advantages, and distinctions of the proposed paradigm. Furthermore, the results also highlight how domain insights can be combined with algorithms to discover meaningful knowledge and formulate evidence-based hypotheses during the data analysis process. Finally, user studies against comparable systems indicate that both XMAS and PSPACE deliver results with better interpretability while placing lower cognitive loads on the users.

At the same time protecting marine ecosystems and seafood resources from the adverse effects of chemical contaminants remains an important issue. Since the 1970s, monitoring of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) chemicals using analytical chemistry has provided important spatial and temporal trend data in three important contexts; relating to human health protection from seafood contamination, addressing threats to marine top predators and finally providing essential evidence to better protect the biodiversity of commercial and non-commercial marine species. A number of regional conventions have led to controls on certain PBT chemicals over several years (termed 'legacy contaminants'; e.g. cadmium, lindane, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs] and polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs]). Analytical chemistry plays a key role in evaluating to what extent such regulatory steps have been effective in leading to reduced emissions of these legacy contaminants into marine environments. In parallel, the application of biomarkers (e.g. DNA adducts, CYP1A-EROD, vitellogenin) and bioassays integrated with analytical chemistry has strengthened the evidence base to support an ecosystem approach to manage marine pollution problems. In recent years, however,. the increased sensitivity of analytical chemistry, toxicity alerts and wider environmental awareness has led to a focus on emerging chemical contaminants (defined as chemicals that have been detected in the environment, but which are currently not included in regulatory monitoring programmes and whose fate and biological impacts are poorly understood). It is also known that natural chemicals (e.g. algal biotoxins) may also pose a threat to marine species and seafood quality. Hence complex mixtures of legacy contaminants, emerging chemicals and natural biotoxins in marine ecosystems represent important scientific, economic and health challenges. In order to meet these challenges and pursue cost-effective scientific approaches that can provide evidence necessary to support policy needs (e.g. the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive), it is widely recognised that there is a need to (i) provide marine exposure assessments for priority contaminants using a range of validated models, passive samplers and biomarkers; (ii) integrate chemical monitoring data with biological effects data across spatial and temporal scales (including quality controls); and (iii) strengthen the evidence base to understand the relationship between exposure to complex chemical mixtures, biological and ecological impacts through integrated approaches and molecular data (e.g. genomics, proteomics and metabolomics). Additionally, we support the widely held view that (iv) that rather than increasing the analytical chemistry monitoring of large number of emerging contaminants, it will be important to target analytical chemistry towards key groups of chemicals of concern using effects-directed analysis. It is also important to evaluate to what extent existing biomarkers and bioassays can address various classes of emerging chemicals using the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) approach now being developed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) with respect to human toxicology and ecotoxicology. © 2013 .","Bioassays; Biomarkers; Chemical mixtures; Marine Strategy Framework Directive; Mode of action; Water Framework Directive","Chemical mixtures; Environmental awareness; Marine strategy framework directives; Mode of action; Organization for economic co-operation and development; Spatial and temporal scale; Spatial and temporal trends; Water Framework Directives; Bioassay; Biodiversity; Biomarkers; Chemicals; Contamination; Ecosystems; Environmental regulations; Food supply; Health risks; Marine pollution; Meats; Mixtures; Molecular biology; Organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Toxicity; Water conservation; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; 1 hydroxypyrene; alkylphenol; brevetoxin; cadmium; chlorphenotane; clotrimazole; cytochrome P450 1A; ecdysteroid; fluorene derivative; fungicide; lindane; naphthalene derivative; organochlorine insecticide; polychlorinated biphenyl; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; pyrethroid; terpenoid; vitellogenin; analytical method; bioassay; biomarker; chemical pollutant; ecotoxicology; marine pollution; pollution monitoring; adverse outcome; article; biological activity; coastal waters; DNA adduct; ecotoxicology; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; food contamination; genomics; genotoxicity; human; liver cancer; metabolomics; nonhuman; proteomics; sea food; sea pollution; Bioassays; Biomarkers; Chemical mixtures; Marine Strategy Framework Directive; Mode of action; Water Framework Directive; Biological Assay; Biological Markers; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Risk Assessment; Toxicity Tests; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Pollution, Chemical; algae",Article,"",Scopus

Goals: Test hypotheses that divergent phenotypes of freshwater threespine stickleback evolve at the same rate as in other species and that derived freshwater and ancestral oceanic (i.e. marine or anadromous) phenotypes are genetically additive. Update a model for contemporary evolution and adaptive radiation based on new genetic and genomic findings. Methods: Summarize published information on contemporary evolution of threespine stickleback and compare published stickleback rates of evolution to those of other species. Analyse F1 hybrid and pure crosses to estimate the coefficient of genetic dominance of phenotypes that differ between oceanic and freshwater populations. Review published information on the genetics and genomics of stickleback phenotypes. Results: Threespine stickleback populations that experience large environmental changes may evolve measurably for multiple traits within ten generations. Rare freshwater-adapted alleles have been recycled from freshwater to oceanic populations by introgression and increase to high frequencies when oceanic stickleback colonize fresh water. These freshwater-adapted alleles tend to be partially recessive, to produce adaptive phenotypic plasticity, and to be linked within several genomic regions, which facilitates their retention in oceanic populations and the evolutionary response to directional selection after invasion of fresh water. Conclusion: The metapopulation structure and great age of the threespine stickleback have produced a genomic architecture and abundant allelic variation that are conducive to predictable contemporary adaptive radiation involving numerous genes and phenotypic traits. © 2013 Michael A.

Here we present genomes from 31 phages infecting multiple strains of the aquatic bacterium Cellulophaga baltica (Bacteroidetes) to provide data for an underrepresented and environmentally abundant bacterial lineage. Comparative genomics delineated 12 phage groups that (i) each represent a new genus, and (ii) represent one novel and four wellknown viral families. This diversity contrasts the few well-studied marine phage systems, but parallels the diversity of phages infecting human-associated bacteria. Although all 12 Cellulophaga phages represent new genera, the podoviruses and icosahedral, nontailed ssDNA phages were exceptional, with genomes up to twice as large as those previously observed for each phage type. Structural novelty was also substantial, requiring experimental phage proteomics to identify 83% of the structural proteins. The presence of uncommon nucleotide metabolism genes in four genera likely underscores the importance of scavenging nutrient-rich molecules as previously seen for phages in marine environments. Metagenomic recruitment analyses suggest that these particular Cellulophaga phages are rare and may represent a first glimpse into the phage side of the rare biosphere. However, these analyses also revealed that these phage genera are widespread, occurring in 94% of 137 investigated metagenomes. Together, this diverse and novel collection of phages identifies a small but ubiquitous fraction of unknown marine viral diversity and provides numerous environmentally relevant phage-host systems for experimental hypothesis testing. © PNAS 2013.","Model systems; Phage genomics; Phage taxonomy; Prophage; Queuosine biosynthesis","article; bacteriophage; bacteriophage typing; Bacteroidetes; biosphere; Cellulophaga baltica; genome; marine environment; metagenomics; Microviridae; new genus; nonhuman; nucleotide metabolism; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; proteomics; sea; model systems; phage genomics; phage taxonomy; prophage; queuosine biosynthesis; Amino Acid Sequence; Bacteriophages; Bacteroidetes; Metagenome; Molecular Sequence Data; Oceans and Seas; Proteome; Proteomics; Viral Proteins",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus

In the absence of genomic data and/or analysis, knowledge of the bacteria that belong to this genus is currently limited to biochemical characteristics. In this study, we analyzed the whole genome sequencing data of six bacteria in the Novosphingobium genus and provide evidence to show the presence of genes that are associated with salt tolerance, cell-cell signaling and aromatic compound biodegradation phenotypes. Additionally, we show the taxonomic relationship between the sequenced bacteria based on phylogenomic analysis, average amino acid identity (AAI) and genomic signatures.Results: The taxonomic clustering of Novosphingobium strains is generally influenced by their isolation source. AAI and genomic signature provide strong support the classification of Novosphingobium sp. PP1Y as Novosphingobium pentaromaticivorans PP1Y. The identification and subsequent functional annotation of the unique core genome in the marine Novosphingobium bacteria show that ectoine synthesis may be the main contributing factor in salt water adaptation. Genes coding for the synthesis and receptor of the cell-cell signaling molecules, of the N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHL) class are identified. Notably, a solo luxR homolog was found in strain PP1Y that may have been recently acquired via horizontal gene transfer as evident by the presence of multiple mobile elements upstream of the gene. Additionally, phylogenetic tree analysis and sequence comparison with functionally validated aromatic ring hydroxylating dioxygenases (ARDO) revealed the presence of several ARDOs (oxygenase) in Novosphingobium bacteria with the majority of them belonging to the Groups II and III of the enzyme.Conclusions: The combination of prior knowledge on the distinctive phenotypes of Novosphingobium strains and meta-analysis of their whole genomes enables the identification of several genes that are relevant in industrial applications and bioremediation.

Available methods for pathogen identification and strain typing have some inherent restrictions. In particular, culturing will yield only a fraction of the species present, PCR of virulence or marker genes is mainly focused on a handful of known species, and shotgun metagenomics is limited in the ability to detect strain variations. In this study, we present a single-cell genome sequencing approach to address these limitations and demonstrate it by specifically targeting bacterial cells within a complex biofilm from a hospital bathroom sink drain. A newly developed, automated platform was used to generate genomic DNA by the multiple displacement amplification (MDA) technique from hundreds of single cells in parallel. MDA reactions were screened and classified by 16S rRNA gene PCR sequence, which revealed a broad range of bacteria covering 25 different genera representing environmental species, human commensals, and opportunistic human pathogens. Here we focus on the recovery of a nearly complete genome representing a novel strain of the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis JCVI SC001) using the single-cell assembly tool SPAdes. Single-cell genomics is becoming an accepted method to capture novel genomes, primarily in the marine and soil environments.

Such cultures will contain varying levels of intrinsic bacterial contamination that can interfere with molecular research and cause problems with the collection of sufficient material for sequencing. Measuring the levels of bacterial contamination for the purposes of molecular biology research is non-trivial, and can be complicated by the presence of a diverse bacterial flora, or by differences in the relative nucleic acid yield per bacterial or eukaryotic cell.Principal Findings:Here we describe a duplex PCR-based assay that can be used to measure the levels of contamination from marine bacteria in a culture of loricate choanoflagellates. By comparison to a standard culture of known target sequence content, the assay can be used to quantify the relative proportions of bacterial and choanoflagellate material in DNA or RNA samples extracted from a culture. We apply the assay to compare methods of purifying choanoflagellate cultures prior to DNA extraction, to determine their effectiveness in reducing bacterial contamination. Together with measurements of the total nucleic acid concentration, the assay can then be used as the basis for determining the absolute amounts of choanoflagellate DNA or RNA present in a sample.Conclusions:The assay protocol we describe here is a simple and relatively inexpensive method of measuring contamination levels in nucleic acid samples. This provides a new way to establish quantification and purification protocols for molecular biology and genomics in novel heterotrophic protist species. Guidelines are provided to develop a similar protocol for use with any protistan culture. This assay method is recommended where qPCR equipment is unavailable, where qPCR is not viable because of the nature of the bacterial contamination or starting material, or where prior sequence information is insufficient to develop qPCR protocols. © 2013 Marron et al.",,"bacterial DNA; bacterial RNA; nucleic acid; RNA 16S; RNA 18S; article; bacterium contamination; choanoflagellate; controlled study; culture technique; DNA extraction; duplex polymerase chain reaction; nonhuman; nucleic acid analysis; nucleotide sequence; polymerase chain reaction; protist; purification; quantitative analysis; sequence analysis; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Cells, Cultured; DNA Contamination; DNA, Bacterial; DNA, Complementary; Eukaryota; Filtration; Plasmids; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Reference Standards; Reproducibility of Results; Templates, Genetic; Bacteria (microorganisms); Choanoflagellida; Eukaryota; Protista",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Here, we describe Picomonas judraskeda gen. et sp. nov., from marine coastal surface waters, which has a 'picobiliphyte' 18S rDNA signature. Using vital mitochondrial staining and cell sorting by flow cytometry, a single cell-derived culture was established. The cells are biflagellate, 2.5-3.8×2-2.5 μm in size, lack plastids and display a novel stereotypic cycle of cell motility (described as the ""jump, drag, and skedaddle""-cycle). They consist of two hemispherical parts separated by a deep cleft, an anterior part that contains all major cell organelles including the flagellar apparatus, and a posterior part housing vacuoles/vesicles and the feeding apparatus, both parts separated by a large vacuolar cisterna. From serial section analyses of cells, fixed at putative stages of the feeding cycle, it is concluded that cells are not bacterivorous, but feed on small marine colloids of less than 150 nm diameter by fluid-phase, bulk flow endocytosis.

The polymer is also synthesized as an exo-polysaccharide by bacteria belonging to the genera Pseudomonas and Azotobacter, and these organisms may represent an alternative alginate source in the future. The current work describes an attempt to rationally develop a biological system tuned for very high levels of alginate production, based on a fundamental understanding of the system through metabolic modeling supported by transcriptomics studies and carefully controlled fermentations.Results: Alginate biosynthesis in Pseudomonas fluorescens was studied in a genomics perspective, using an alginate over-producing strain carrying a mutation in the anti-sigma factor gene mucA. Cells were cultivated in chemostats under nitrogen limitation on fructose or glycerol as carbon sources, and cell mass, growth rate, sugar uptake, alginate and CO2 production were monitored. In addition a genome scale metabolic model was constructed and samples were collected for transcriptome analyses. The analyses show that polymer production operates in a close to optimal way with respect to stoichiometric utilization of the carbon source and that the cells increase the uptake of carbon source to compensate for the additional needs following from alginate synthesis. The transcriptome studies show that in the presence of the mucA mutation, the alg operon is upregulated together with genes involved in energy generation, genes on both sides of the succinate node of the TCA cycle and genes encoding ribosomal and other translation-related proteins. Strains expressing a functional MucA protein (no alginate production) synthesize cellular biomass in an inefficient way, apparently due to a cycle that involves oxidation of NADPH without ATP production. The results of this study indicate that the most efficient way of using a mucA mutant as a cell factory for alginate production would be to use non-growing conditions and nitrogen deprivation.Conclusions: The insights gained in this study should be very useful for a future efficient production of microbial alginates. © 2013 Borgos et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Alginate; Genome-scale metabolic modeling; Polysaccharide; Pseudomonas","Azotobacter; Bacteria (microorganisms); Pseudomonas; Pseudomonas fluorescens; alginic acid; bacterial protein; glucuronic acid; hexuronic acid; MucA protein, Pseudomonas; article; biological model; bioreactor; biosynthesis; biotechnology; cell culture; fermentation; gene expression profiling; genetics; genomics; metabolism; methodology; microarray analysis; mutation; principal component analysis; Pseudomonas fluorescens; Alginates; Bacterial Proteins; Bioreactors; Biotechnology; Cells, Cultured; Fermentation; Gene Expression Profiling; Genomics; Glucuronic Acid; Hexuronic Acids; Microarray Analysis; Models, Biological; Mutation; Principal Component Analysis; Pseudomonas fluorescens",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

This necessitates either the cultivation of a restricted number of species for standard sequencing projects or the analysis of highly complex environmental DNA metagenome data. Single-cell genomics (SCG) offers a solution to this problem by constraining the studied DNA sample to an individual cell and its associated symbionts, prey, and pathogens. We used SCG to study marine heterotrophic amoebae related to Paulinella ovalis (A. Wulff) P.W. Johnson, P.E. Hargraves & J.M. Sieburth (Rhizaria). The genus Paulinella is best known for its photosynthetic members such as P. chromatophora Lauterborn that is the only case of plastid primary endosymbiosis known outside of algae and plants. Here, we studied the phagotrophic sister taxa of P. chromatophora that are related to P. ovalis and found one SCG assembly to contain α-cyanobacterial DNA. These cyanobacterial contigs are presumably derived from prey. We also uncovered an associated cyanophage lineage (provisionally named phage PoL_MC2). Phylogenomic analysis of the fragmented genome assembly suggested a minimum genome size of 200 Kbp for phage PoL_MC2 that encodes 179 proteins and is most closely related to Synechococcus phage S-SM2. For this phage, gene network analysis demonstrates a highly modular genome structure typical of other cyanophages.

Knowledge of marine life is expanding rapidly as new species are discovered and as the complexity and biodiversity of marine organisms and ecosystems is better recognised. Marine bioresources hold great potential as a source of novel products and processes yet remain largely untapped. The application of biotechnology to these resources may help to address the global challenges of food, energy security and health and contribute to green growth and sustainable industries. At the same time, the conditions for maintaining a sustainable relationship between the conservation and use of marine bioresources is becoming better understood. Marine organisms live in a vast interconnected system of oceans that contribute to the regulation of the planet's temperature and atmospheric conditions. Ocean currents carry marine life, nutrients and wastes within and across national borders. This fluid, shared environment and the mobile and geographically dispersed organisms contained within it present governance challenges that relate both to access to and development of marine resources. The interrelation of marine bioresources in complex marine ecosystems raises further challenges for studying marine life and for its development and conservation. This report considers the tension between productivity and sustainability faced by those seeking to realise the potential of marine biotechnology. It seeks to identify the field's potential and the support required to achieve that potential, and explores the challenges to sustainable development, in view of the unique features of the marine environment and the need to maximise its integrity and sustainability for future generations. The application of biotechnology to marine organisms raises several issues that create challenges for policy makers. Two recurrent themes have appeared important for the sustainable development of marine biotechnology: The need for communication among stakeholders and the need for internationally coordinated action. While these themes are not unique to the field, their emergence from this study's focus on the distinctive features of marine biotechnology makes them especially noteworthy and in need of attention in future policy work. As governments work to develop appropriate frameworks for marine biotechnology, it will be important to consider the main messages that emerge from this report: • Advances in science and technology are providing new insights into the diversity of life in the oceans and contributing to a greatly improved understanding of marine bioresources. As knowledge of these resources increases, it is becoming clear that the biodiversity of the ocean offers manifold possibilities for development and exploitation. • The biodiversity of the marine environment may help to address some global challenges through innovative food production systems, new sources of renewable energy, products for health and well-being and sustainable industries. Many countries have recognised this potential and are integrating marine biotechnology into national bioeconomy and innovation strategies. • Strong marine biodiversity underpins healthy marine ecosystems, which contribute positively to the healthy functioning of the planet. Development of ocean bioresources must therefore occur in a manner that conserves the ocean's biodiversity. This will require a governance framework that will enable the development of marine bioresources in a sustainable manner. • The interconnectedness of the world's oceans and their complex, widely distributed ecosystems suggests that governance of marine bioresources will be most effective if considered at international level. Several international conventions and agreements provide a framework for the conservation of marine biodiversity and for access to and sharing the benefits of marine bioresources. Yet these agreements tend to break down in areas beyond national jurisdictions; this suggests the need for finding ways to address this gap. • Better R&D infrastructure and platforms will be needed to improve our understanding of marine bioresources and to improve our access to and development of these resources. The shared and dynamic nature of ocean bioresources, together with the sheer size of the development opportunities (and challenges), means that national and international co-operation will be needed to develop infrastructure to support marine biotechnology. • As marine biotechnology becomes a focus of government innovation strategies and investment, it will be important to measure the return on government and private-sector investment. New measures and indicators may be needed to measure the impact of investment and the effectiveness of government policies.•Marine biotechnology has applications in sectors such as energy (e.g. algal biofuels), pharmaceuticals (e.g. novel antibacterials), food (e.g. genomics of major food fish species) and chemical industries (a host of chemical types, such as polysaccharides). They will require different types of industry incentives and partnership strategies to foster the effective development and diffusion of technology. All sectors will benefit from discussions and engagement with relevant stakeholders at an early stage. •Characterising and monitoring the health of marine ecosystems at many levels requires new tools and measures. Given the shared nature and complexity of marine bioresources and marine ecosystems, such tools will be most effective if developed and applied internationally. Similarly, it will be necessary to monitor and evaluate relevant policy and governance measures. The OECD Working Party on Biotechnology is proposing to take forward work on marine biotechnology and on its potential contribution to green growth in 2013-14. This will provide the WPB an opportunity to build on this report and, with other organisations and stakeholders, to explore further the issues raised with a view to contributing to international policy and governance on marine biotechnology. © OECD 2013.",,,Book,"",Scopus

Dereplication studies by high resolution Fourier transform mass spectrometry coupled to liquid chromatography (LC-HRFTMS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can establish the chemical profile of endophytic and/or endozoic microbial extracts and their plant or animal sources. Identifying the compounds of interest at an early stage will aid in the isolation of the bioactive components. Therefore metabolite profiling is important for functional genomics and in the search for new pharmacologically active compounds. Using the tools of metabolomics through the employment of LC-HRFTMS as well as high resolution NMR will be a very efficient approach. Metabolomic profiling has found its application in screening extracts of macroorganisms as well as in the isolation and cultivation of suspected microbial producers of bioactive natural products. Metabolomics is being applied to identify and biotechnologically optimize the production of pharmacologically active secondary metabolites. The links between metabolome evolution during optimization and processing factors can be identified through metabolomics. Information obtained from a metabolomics dataset can efficiently establish cultivation and production processes at a small scale which will be finally scaled up to a fermenter system, while maintaining or enhancing synthesis of the desired compounds.

For instance, some species have undergone a strong reduction of their genome with a drastic reduction of their genic repertoire. Deciphering the causes of these atypical trajectories can be very difficult because of the many phenomena that are intertwined during their evolution (e.g. changes of population size, environment structure and dynamics, selection strength, mutation rates...). Here we propose a methodology based on synthetic experiments to test the individual effect of these phenomena on a population of simulated organisms. We developed an evolutionary model--aevol--in which evolutionary conditions can be changed one at a time to test their effects on genome size and organization (e.g. coding ratio). To illustrate the proposed approach, we used aevol to test the effects of a strong reduction in the selection strength on a population of (simulated) bacteria. Our results show that this reduction of selection strength leads to a genome reduction of ~35% with a slight loss of coding sequences (~15% of the genes are lost--mainly those for which the contribution to fitness is the lowest). More surprisingly, under a low selection strength, genomes undergo a strong reduction of the noncoding compartment (~55% of the noncoding sequences being lost). These results are consistent with what is observed in reduced Prochlorococcus strains (marine cyanobacteria) when compared to close relatives.",,"article; Buchnera; Escherichia coli; genetic selection; genetics; genome; genomics; molecular evolution; nucleotide sequence; Prochlorococcus; Base Sequence; Buchnera; Escherichia coli; Evolution, Molecular; Genome; Genomics; Prochlorococcus; Selection, Genetic",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

The most frequently encountered marine NOB are related to Nitrospina gracilis, an aerobic chemolithoautotrophic bacterium isolated from ocean surface waters. To date, limited physiological and genomic data for this organism were available and its phylogenetic affiliation was uncertain. In this study, the draft genome sequence of N. gracilis strain 3/211 was obtained. Unexpectedly for an aerobic organism, N. gracilis lacks classical reactive oxygen defense mechanisms and uses the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle for carbon fixation.These features indicate microaerophilic ancestry and are consistent with the presence of Nitrospina in marine oxygen minimum zones. Fixed carbon is stored intracellularly as glycogen, but genes for utilizing external organic carbon sources were not identified. N. gracilis also contains a full gene set for oxidative phosphorylation with oxygen as terminal electron acceptor and for reverse electron transport from nitrite to NADH. A novel variation of complex I may catalyze the required reverse electron flow to low-potential ferredoxin. Interestingly, comparative genomics indicated a strong evolutionary link between Nitrospina, the nitrite-oxidizing genus Nitrospira, and anaerobic ammonium oxidizers, apparently including the horizontal transfer of a periplasmically oriented nitrite oxidoreductase and other key genes for nitrite oxidation at an early evolutionary stage. Further, detailed phylogenetic analyses using concatenated marker genes provided evidence that Nitrospina forms a novel bacterial phylum, for which we propose the name Nitrospinae. © 2013 Lücker, Nowka, Rattei, Spieck and Daims.","Marine nitrogen cycle; Nitrification; Nitrite oxidation; Nitrite oxidoreductase; Nitrite-oxidizing bacteria; Nitrospina","Bacteria (microorganisms); Nitrospina; Nitrospina gracilis; Nitrospira",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

In recent years, various experimental 'omics' approaches have been applied to farmed flatfishes to increment the genomic resources available. These tools are beginning to identify genetic markers associated with traits of commercial interest, and to unravel the molecular basis of different physiological processes.

In current Fe(II)-rich environments, such as hydrothermal vents, mudflats, freshwater wetlands or the rhizosphere, rusty mat-like deposits are common. The presence of abundant biogenic microtubular or filamentous iron oxyhydroxides readily reveals the role of FeOB (iron-oxidizing bacteria) in iron mat formation. Cultivation and cultivation-independent techniques, confirm that FeOB are abundant in these mats. Despite remarkable similarities in morphological characteristics between marine and freshwater FeOB communities, the resident populations of FeOB are phylogenetically distinct, with marine populations related to the class Zetaproteobacteria, whereas freshwater populations are dominated by members of the Gallionallaceae, a family within the Betaproteobacteria. Little is known about the mechanism of how FeOB acquire electrons from Fe(II), although it is assumed that it involves electron transfer from the site of iron oxidation at the cell surface to the cytoplasmic membrane. Comparative genomics between freshwater and marine strains reveals few shared genes, except for a suite of genes that include a class of molybdopterin oxidoreductase that could be involved in iron oxidation via extracellular electron transport. Other genes are implicated as well, and the overall genomic analysis reveals a group of organisms exquisitely adapted for growth on iron. ©The Authors Journal compilation ©2012 Biochemical Society.","Biogeochemistry; Gallionallaceae; Iron-oxidizing bacterium; Microaerobic iron(II) oxidation; Zetaproteobacteria","ferrous ion; biogeochemistry; biomineralization; cellular distribution; chemical structure; conference paper; Gallionella; genetic variability; Leptothrix; microbiology; nonhuman; oxidation; precipitation; priority journal; Adaptation, Biological; Ferrous Compounds; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxygen; Phylogeny; Proteobacteria; Water Microbiology; Bacteria (microorganisms); Betaproteobacteria",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

They support diverse microbial communities that influence the nitrogen economy of the oceans, contributing to major losses of fixed nitrogen as dinitrogen (N2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) gases. Anaerobic microbial processes, including the two pathways of N2 production, denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation, are oxygen-sensitive, with some occurring only under strictly anoxic conditions. The detection limit of the usual method (Winkler titrations) for measuring dissolved oxygen in seawater, however, is much too high to distinguish low oxygen conditions from true anoxia. However, new analytical technologies are revealing vanishingly low oxygen concentrations in nitriterich OMZs, indicating that these OMZs are essentially anoxic marine zones (AMZs). Autonomous monitoring platforms also reveal previously unrecognized episodic intrusions of oxygen into the AMZ core, which could periodically support aerobic metabolisms in a typically anoxic environment. Although nitrogen cycling is considered to dominate the microbial ecology and biogeochemistry of AMZs, recent environmental genomics and geochemical studies show the presence of other relevant processes, particularly those associated with the sulfur and carbon cycles. AMZs correspond to an intermediate state between two ""end points"" represented by fully oxic systems and fully sulfidic systems.

Initial comparative genomics and physiological studies have revealed a novel, and as yet unresolved, primarily copper-based pathway for ammonia oxidation and respiration distinct from that of known ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and possibly relevant to the production of atmospherically active nitrogen oxides.

Nearly all ray-finned fishes are teleosts, which include most commercially important fish species, several model organisms for genomics and developmental biology, and the dominant component of marine and freshwater vertebrate faunas. Despite the economic and scientific importance of ray-finned fishes, the lack of a single comprehensive phylogeny with corresponding divergence- time estimates has limited our understanding of the evolution and diversification of this radiation. Our analyses, which use multiple nuclear gene sequences in conjunction with 36 fossil age constraints, result in a well-supported phylogeny of all major rayfinned fish lineages and molecular age estimates that are generally consistent with the fossil record. This phylogeny informs three long-standing problems: specifically identifying elopomorphs (eels and tarpons) as the sister lineage of all other teleosts, providing a unique hypothesis on the radiation of early euteleosts, and offering a promising strategy for resolution of the ""bush at the top of the tree"" that includes percomorphs and other spiny-finned teleosts. Contrasting our divergence time estimates with studies using a single nuclear gene or whole mitochondrial genomes, we find that the former underestimates ages of the oldest ray-finned fish divergences, but the latter dramatically overestimates ages for derived teleost lineages. Our time-calibrated phylogeny reveals that much of the diversification leading to extant groups of teleosts occurred between the late Mesozoic and early Cenozoic, identifying this period as the ""Second Age of Fishes."".","Actinopterygii; Molecular clock; Percomorpha; Species tree; Teleostei","fresh water; amino acid sequence; article; Bayes theorem; developmental biology; DNA sequence; eel; fish; freshwater fish; gene sequence; genetic variability; genome analysis; mitochondrial genome; Monte Carlo method; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; stop codon; teleost",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus

Phytoplankton growth is widely limited by the availability of iron, an essential component of the photosynthetic apparatus. The oceanic diatom Thalassiosira oceanica shows a remarkable tolerance to low-iron conditions and was chosen as a model for deciphering the cellular response upon shortage of this essential micronutrient.Results: The combined efforts in genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics reveal an unexpected metabolic flexibility in response to iron availability for T. oceanica CCMP1005. The complex response comprises cellular retrenchment as well as remodeling of bioenergetic pathways, where the abundance of iron-rich photosynthetic proteins is lowered, whereas iron-rich mitochondrial proteins are preserved. As a consequence of iron deprivation, the photosynthetic machinery undergoes a remodeling to adjust the light energy utilization with the overall decrease in photosynthetic electron transfer complexes.Conclusions: Beneficial adaptations to low-iron environments include strategies to lower the cellular iron requirements and to enhance iron uptake. A novel contribution enhancing iron economy of phototrophic growth is observed with the iron-regulated substitution of three metal-containing fructose-bisphosphate aldolases involved in metabolic conversion of carbohydrates for enzymes that do not contain metals. Further, our data identify candidate components of a high-affinity iron-uptake system, with several of the involved genes and domains originating from duplication events. A high genomic plasticity, as seen from the fraction of genes acquired through horizontal gene transfer, provides the platform for these complex adaptations to a low-iron world. © 2012 Lommer et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"cell surface protein; fructose bisphosphate aldolase; iron; mitochondrial protein; iron; adaptation; article; carbohydrate metabolism; cell energy; diatom; electron transport; energy expenditure; food deprivation; genome; genomics; iron transport; isotope labeling; nonhuman; nutrient availability; photosynthesis; phototrophy; protein expression; proteomics; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Thalassiosira oceanica; transcriptomics; deficiency; diatom; evolution; gene expression regulation; genetics; horizontal gene transfer; molecular genetics; physiology; procedures; sequence analysis; species difference; Bacillariophyta; Thalassiosira oceanica; Adaptation, Biological; Biological Evolution; Diatoms; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Transfer, Horizontal; Genome; Genomics; Iron; Molecular Sequence Data; Photosynthesis; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Species Specificity",Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus

The avalanche of genomic data has provided an unbiased view of marine biology that has never been seen before. In particular, comparative and metagenomic approaches with microbes from different biogeochemical marine provinces provided the first insights into how they acquire and discard genes as needed, even across kingdom boundaries, in response to their environment. These data clearly reveal that marine microbes have remarkable abilities to change their genomes according to both environmental stresses and biotic interactions. Thus, it is most likely that the flux of energy and matter in the marine system is reflected by the presence or absence of genes and proteins in marine organisms, which could provide novel tools to understand biogeochemical processes of global significance.

Genome-wide variation at greater than 1000 single nucleotide polymorphism loci indicate separate origin of giant lake and small-bodied stream fish within each watershed (mean FST between watersheds = 0.244 and within = 0.114). Genome scans within watersheds identified a total of 21 genomic regions that are highly differentiated between ecotypes and are probably subject to directional selection. Most outliers were watershed-specific, but genomic regions undergoing parallel genetic changes in multiple watersheds were also identified. Interestingly, several of the stream-lake outlier regions match those previously identified in marine-freshwater and benthic-limnetic genome scans, indicating reuse of the same genetic loci in different adaptive scenarios. We also identified multiple new outlier loci, which may contribute to unique aspects of differentiation in stream-lake environments. Overall, our data emphasize the important role of ecological boundaries in driving both local and broadly occurring parallel genetic changes during adaptation. © 2011 The Royal Society.","Ecological speciation; Gasterosteus; Genome scan; Single nucleotide polymorphism","ecotype; evolutionary biology; genetic variation; genome; genomics; polymorphism; speciation (biology); teleost; British Columbia; Canada; Queen Charlotte Islands; Gasterosteus",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus

Here we employed a phylogenomic approach to identify marine adaptation genes in marine Actinobacteria. The focus was on the obligate marine actinomycete genus Salinispora and the identification of marine adaptation genes that have been acquired from other marine bacteria.Results: Functional annotation, comparative genomics, and evidence of a shared evolutionary history with bacteria from hyperosmotic environments were used to identify a pool of more than 50 marine adaptation genes. An Actinobacterial species tree was used to infer the likelihood of gene gain or loss in accounting for the distribution of each gene. Acquired marine adaptation genes were associated with electron transport, sodium and ABC transporters, and channels and pores. In addition, the loss of a mechanosensitive channel gene appears to have played a major role in the inability of Salinispora strains to grow following transfer to low osmotic strength media.Conclusions: The marine Actinobacteria for which genome sequences are available are broadly distributed throughout the Actinobacterial phylogenetic tree and closely related to non-marine forms suggesting they have been independently introduced relatively recently into the marine environment. It appears that the acquisition of transporters in Salinispora spp. represents a major marine adaptation while gene loss is proposed to play a role in the inability of this genus to survive outside of the marine environment.

Here, we describe a three-step molecular approach focused on 1) identifying new candidate genes for phylogenetic analysis of Symbiodinium spp., 2) characterizing the phylogenetic relationship of these candidate genes from DNA samples spanning eight Symbiodinium clades (A-H), and 3) conducting in-depth phylogenetic analyses of candidate genes displaying genetic divergences equal or higher than those within the ITS-2 of Symbiodinium clade C. To this end, we used bioinformatics tools and reciprocal comparisons to identify homologous genes from 55,551 cDNA sequences representing two Symbiodinium and six additional dinoflagellate EST libraries.

Despite the recent de-emphasis on natural product research by the pharmaceutical industry, no other drug discovery platform has proved to be as effective in yielding unique chemical structures with either direct application in the treatment of disease or the capacity to serve as chemical scaffolds from which molecules with enhanced efficacy can be derived. There is little doubt that myriad structural motifs remain undiscovered from natural sources and that these molecules will be an important source of new medicines in the future (Jensen et al. 2005). Due to a recent deceleration in natural product research in terrestrial habitats, there is increasing interest in the exploration of marine microorganisms for novel metabolites such as anticancer and antimicrobial compounds. In exploring new sources of bioactive natural products, the marine environment warrants particular attention in view of its remarkable diversity of microorganisms and metabolic products. The oceans are highly complex environments and house a diverse assemblage of microorganisms that occur in environments with extreme variations in pressure, salinity, and temperature. The oceans cover around 70% of the Earth’s surface and present themselves as an unexplored area of opportunity. Marine microorganisms encompass a complex and diverse assemblage of microscopic life forms, of which it is estimated that only 1% has been cultured or identified to date (Bernan, Greenstein, and Carter 2004). It is estimated that marine environments, including the subsurface, harbor approximately 3.67 × 1030 microorganisms (Whitman, Coleman, and Wiebe 1998) that represent an extraordinary and dynamic gene pool of biodiversity. The majority of these microbes have never been cultured, identified, or classified, and their enormous chemical richness remains untapped (DeLong 1997). However, in the past two decades this situation has changed as a result of the rapid progress achieved in related fields. The search for bioactive compounds is presently reaching a new dimension with such diverse approaches as genomics, proteomics, bioinformatics, combinatorial biosynthesis, combinatorial chemistry, targeted drug development, directed evolution of key enzymes, phage-display libraries, automation, and high-throughput screening (Wagner-Dobler et al. 2002). © 2013 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Book Chapter,"",Scopus

In aquatic photoautotrophs including cyanobacteria, zinc is thought to be required for carbonic anhydrase and alkaline phosphatase, although there is evidence that at least some carbonic anhydrases can be cambialistic, i.e., are able to acquire in vivo and function with different metal cofactors such as Co2+ and Cd2+. Given the global importance of marine phytoplankton, zinc availability in the oceans is likely to have an impact on both carbon and phosphorus cycles. Zinc concentrations in seawater vary over several orders of magnitude, and in the open oceans adopt a nutrient-like profile. Most studies on zinc handling by cyanobacteria have focused on freshwater strains and zinc toxicity; much less information is available on marine strains and zinc limitation. Several systems for zinc homeostasis have been characterized in the freshwater species Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 and Synechocystis sp.

Comparative metallo-genomics has begun to explore not only the putative zinc proteome, but also specific protein families predicted to have an involvement in zinc homeostasis, including sensors for excess and limitation (SmtB and its homologs as well as Zur), uptake systems (ZnuABC), putative intracellular zinc chaperones (COG0523) and metallothioneins (BmtA), and efflux pumps (ZiaA and its homologs). © 2012 Barnett, Millard, Ksibe, Scanlan, Schmid and Blindauer.","BmtA; COG0523; SmtA; Zinc limitation; Zur",,Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

This method has now been applied to a handful of symbiotic systems, including bacterial symbionts of marine sponges, insects (grasshoppers, termites), and vertebrates (mouse, human). In each case, novel insights were obtained into the functional genomic repertoire of the bacterial partner, which, in turn, led to an improved understanding of the corresponding host.

Doubly Uniparental Inheritance (DUI) is one of the most striking exceptions to the general rule of strict maternal transmission of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in animals, and characterized by the presence of gender-associated mtDNA lineages that are inherited through male (male-transmitted or M type) or female (female-transmitted or F type) respectively. The complete mitochondrial genome of F type of Lamprotula leai was obtained using long and accurate polymerase chain reaction (LA-PCR), shotgun sequencing. The genome contains 16, 530 base pairs and 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA genes including 2 tRNASer and 2 tRNALeu, anticodons are tRNALeu1(UUR) = (TAA), tRNALeu2(CUN) = (TAG), tRNASer1(AGN) = (TCT), tRNASer2(UCN) = (TGA), 2 ribosomal RNA genes, and 27 non-coding regions. The base composition for is 36. 34% A, 23. 94% T, 27. 17% C, 12. 55% G and 60. 28% (A+T). Most genes are encoded on the L strand while ND3-ND5, ND4L, CO I-COIII, ATP8, ATP6, tRNAAsp, tRNAHis are encoded on the H strand. The structure and organization of mitochondrial genomes of L. leai and other six freshwater mussels were analyzed using comparative genomics and bioinformatics methods. Results showed that: (i) Strong bias is toward A+T for the F type genome of L. leai. (ii) The striking mitochondrial genome difference in the size performed on the non-coding regions in all these freshwater mussels. (iii) The gene arrangement of L. leai is identical to that of Hyriopsis cumingii, but is different from that of Cristaria plicata, Lampsilis ornate, Pyganodon grandis, Quadrula quadrulaand and Venustaconcha ellipsiformis between CO II and 12S rRNA. Therefore, the F type of freshwater mussels exist two gene orders between CO II and 12S rRNA: one is CO II-ND3-H-A-S1-S2-E-ND2-M-W-R-rrnS, another is CO II-H-S1-ND2-M-ND3-A-S2-E-W-R-rrnS. The difference is caused by rearrangement of 8 genes, including ND3, tRNAHis, tRNAAla, tRNASer1, tRNASer2, tRNAGlu, ND2 and tRNAMet. (iv) 13 protein genes contain 4 initiation codons which are I (AUU, AUC), V (GUG), M(AUA), L(UUG) and the stop codons of UAA or UAG with the exception of ND4 with incomplete T. (v) Analysis show that most of 22 tRNAs have typical cloverleaf structures, the acceptor of tRNALys and tRNAThr have bulge loop for T and A base unpairing, the anticodon loop of tRNAS2 has 9 bases. 5 kinds of base unpairing are showed in the secondary structure of tRNA, such as A-C, A-A, G-T, T-T and T-C, in acceptor, D-loop and TψC loop. (vi) 27 noncoding regions exist in L. leai, ranging in size from 1 to 969 bp. 4 largest noncoding regions are found between ND5-tRNAGln (969bp), tRNAGlu -tRNATrp (288 bp), ND3-tRNATrp (116 bp), and tRNAHis -tRNASer (114 bp), only the 116 bp noncoding regions has an high A+T content (A+T = 74. 14%). (vii) Phylogenetic trees show that L. leai is clustered together with other freshwater mussels and far away from marine bivalves. The results of this study provide basic information for genetic resources and rule of DUI transmission of mtDNA in freshwater mussel, also provide the basis and model for gene rearrangement of mitochondrial genome in bivalves.","F type of mitochondrial genome; Gene rearrangement; Lamprotula leai; Sequence analysis","animal product; bioinformatics; bivalve; freshwater environment; gene expression; genetic analysis; genetic structure; genome; mitochondrial DNA; mussel culture; phylogenetics; polymerase chain reaction; protein; Animalia; Bivalvia; Cristaria plicata; Hyriopsis cumingii; Lamprotula leai; Lampsilis; Pyganodon grandis; Quadrula; Venustaconcha ellipsiformis",Article,"",Scopus

We analysed the state of the art for cultivation of whole sponges, sponge cells and sponge symbionts. To date, cultivation of whole sponges has been most successful in situ; however, optimal conditions are species specific. The establishment of sponge cell lines has been limited by the inability to obtain an axenic inoculum as well as the lack of knowledge on nutritional requirements in vitro. Approaches to overcome these bottlenecks, including transformation of sponge cells and using media based on yolk, are elaborated. Although a number of bioactive metabolite-producing microorganisms have been isolated from sponges, and it has been suggested that the source of most sponge-derived bioactive compounds is microbial symbionts, cultivation of sponge-specific microorganisms has had limited success.

We discuss the pros and cons of the molecular gene partitions used to date and the prospects of a plentiful supply of new markers for sponge ecological studies in the near future, in light of recently available molecular technologies. We predict that molecular ecology studies of sponges will move from genetics (the use of one or some genes) to genomics (extensive genome or transcriptome sequencing) in the forthcoming years and that sponge ecologists will take advantage of this research trend to answer ecological and biological questions that would have been impossible to address a few years ago. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Chimerism; Clonality; Cryptic speciation; Gene expression; Microsatellites; Phylogeography; Population genetics; Porifera","biomarker; chimera; clonal growth; connectivity; ecosystem function; ecosystem response; gene expression; genetic marker; genetic variation; marine environment; molecular analysis; molecular ecology; phylogeography; speciation (biology); species diversity; sponge; zoobenthos; Porifera",Book Chapter,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

Thus, we have obtained extensive cDNA information by the pyrosequencing method, to utilize the polychaete species as a test organism for sediment quality monitoring studies. From the total RNA of P. nuntia, cDNA was reversely synthesized and randomly sequenced using a GS-FLX sequencer. In the assembly stage 1, 40,379 transcripts (13,666 contigs and 26,713 singletons) were acquired and showed 47% hitting rate compared with the GenBank non-redundant (NR) amino acid sequence database using BLASTX. After the stage-2 assembly, 21,657 transcripts were identified and showed 28% hitting rate. Finally, we obtained 6 064 unigenes that corresponded to the GenBank NR amino acid sequence database using BLASTX. Of the transcripts obtained in this species, we found a number of stress- and cell defense-related genes (e.g. heat shock protein family, antioxidant-related genes, cytochrome P450 genes) that are potentially useful for sediment monitoring at the molecular level, indicating that the pyrosequencing method is an effective approach to uncover gene families of potential biomarker genes simultaneously, and thus make transcriptomic studies possible. To confirm the usefulness of those potential biomarker genes, we analyzed the comparative profiling of P. nuntia mRNA transcripts between the samples collected from the polychaete aquaculture farm and the southern coast field of South Korea.

In this study, we employed comparative genomics approaches to extensively investigate synonymous codon usage bias and evolutionary rates in a large number of closely related species of marine unicellular cyanobacteria. Although these two groups of marine cyanobacteria have a close phylogenetic relationship, we find that they are highly divergent not only in codon usage patterns but also in the driving forces behind the diversification. It is revealed that in Prochlorococcus, mutation and genome compositional constraints are the main forces contributing to codon usage bias, whereas in Synechococcus, translational selection. In addition, nucleotide substitution rate analysis indicates that they are not evolving at a constant rate after the divergence and that the average d N/d S values of core genes in Synechococcus are significantly higher than those in Prochlorococcus.

This has presented a significant challenge to marine ecosystem models, which are traditionally diversity poor, and often do not include adaptive/evolutionary processes. Here we explore the use of evolutionary individual-based models (IBMs) as a means of addressing some of these issues. In the IBM, we associate a digital 'genome' with each agent, which codes for the phenotypic traits of simulated organisms. Random mutations at the point of reproduction then allow adaptation in response to changing environmental conditions. Trade-offs between different physiological parameters result in different growth strategies emerging under different forcing scenarios. As an idealised test-case we consider resource competition in a chemostat environment, and compare the individual-based approach to a more traditional population-level model. When run in a non-evolutionary context using a clonal population of agents, the IBM reproduces the results of the population-level model. With evolutionary processes enabled, optimally adapted agents are observed to rise to prominence within the agent population. Their physiological trait values are shown to compare well with theoretical optimal trait combinations derived using resource competition theory. In more variable environments, the model is also shown to capture adaptation in response to changed environmental conditions. We conclude that IBMs represent a useful framework for building detailed models linking (sub-)individual-level processes to emergent ecosystem-level behaviour in simplified 0- or 1-D representations of the environment, which should complement global marine ecosystem models of high spatial complexity but necessarily simple process representation. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation; Individual-based modelling; Marine microorganisms; Resource competition; Storage strategies","Adaptation; Clonal population; Competition theory; Detailed models; Environmental conditions; Evolutionary dynamics; Evolutionary process; Genomics; Global marines; Growth strategy; Individual-based; Individual-based modelling; Individual-based models; Marine ecosystem; Marine microbial diversity; Marine microorganism; Microbial communities; Microbial populations; Phenotypic traits; Physiological parameters; Physiological trait; Process representation; Random mutation; Spatial complexity; Variable environment; Ecosystems; Microorganisms; Physiology; Physiological models; adaptation; ecological modeling; ecosystem modeling; environmental conditions; genomics; marine ecosystem; microbial community; mutation; phenotype; physiological response; population modeling; population structure; reproduction; species diversity; trade-off",Article,"",Scopus

R11, a member of the marine Roseobacter clade, causes a bleaching disease in the temperate-marine red macroalga, Delisea pulchra. To begin to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underpinning the ability of Nautella sp. R11 to colonize, invade and induce bleaching of D. pulchra, we sequenced and analyzed its genome. The genome encodes several factors such as adhesion mechanisms, systems for the transport of algal metabolites, enzymes that confer resistance to oxidative stress, cytolysins, and global regulatory mechanisms that may allow for the switch of Nautella sp. R11 to a pathogenic lifestyle. Many virulence effectors common in phytopathogenic bacteria are also found in the R11 genome, such as the plant hormone indole acetic acid, cellulose fibrils, succinoglycan and nodulation protein L. Comparative genomics with non-pathogenic Roseobacter strains and a newly identified pathogen, Phaeobacter sp. LSS9, revealed a patchy distribution of putative virulence factors in all genomes, but also led to the identification of a quorum sensing (QS) dependent transcriptional regulator that was unique to pathogenic Roseobacter strains. This observation supports the model that a combination of virulence factors and QS-dependent regulatory mechanisms enables indigenous members of the host alga's epiphytic microbial community to switch to a pathogenic lifestyle, especially under environmental conditions when innate host defence mechanisms are compromised. © 2011 Fernandes et al.",,"amino acid; arginine; cytolysin; indoleacetic acid; pyruvate carboxylase; pyruvate phosphate dikinase; RNA 16S; virulence factor; article; bacterial colonization; bacterial genome; bacterial strain; bacterial virulence; bleaching disease; cell invasion; chemotaxis; comparative genomic hybridization; controlled study; cytolysis; Delisea pulchra; DNA isolation; epiphyte; gene sequence; host resistance; marine environment; microbial community; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; oxidative stress; photosynthesis; plankton; plant disease; quorum sensing; red alga; Roseobacter; signal transduction; transcription regulation; bacterial genome; bacterium; gene expression regulation; genetic variability; genetics; genome; high performance liquid chromatography; mass spectrometry; metabolism; methodology; phylogeny; virulence; Bacteria; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Genetic Variation; Genome; Genome, Bacterial; Mass Spectrometry; Phylogeny; Quorum Sensing; Rhodophyta; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Roseobacter; Virulence; Virulence Factors",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

This cycle is driven by complex biogeochemical transformations, including nitrogen fixation, denitrification, and assimilation and anaerobic ammonia oxidation, mediated by microorganisms. New processes and organisms continue to be discovered, complicating the already complex picture of oceanic N cycling. Genomics research has uncovered the diversity of nitrogen metabolism strategies in phytoplankton and bacterioplankton. The elemental ratios of nutrients in biological material are more flexible than previously believed, with implications for vertical export of carbon and associated nutrients to the deep ocean. Estimates of nitrogen fixation and denitrification continue to be modified, and anaerobic ammonia oxidation has been identified as a new process involved in denitrification in oxygen minimum zones. The nitrogen cycle in the oceans is an integral feature of the function of ocean ecosystems and will be a central player in how oceans respond during global environmental change.

Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) deamidase (EC 3.5.1.42), one of the key enzymes of the bacterial pyridine nucleotide cycle, was originally described in Enterobacteria, but the corresponding gene eluded identification for over 30 years. A genomics-based reconstruction of NAD metabolism across hundreds of bacterial species suggested thatNMNdeamidase reaction is the only possible way of nicotinamide salvage in the marine bacterium Shewanella oneidensis. This prediction was verified via purification of native NMN deamidase from S. oneidensis followed by the identification of the respective gene, termed pncC. Enzymatic characterization of the PncC protein, as well as phenotype analysis of deletion mutants, confirmed its proposed biochemical and physiological function in S. oneidensis. Of the three PncC homologs present in Escherichia coli,NMNdeamidase activity was confirmed only for the recombinant purified product of the ygaD gene. A comparative analysis at the level of sequence and three-dimensional structure, which is available for one of the PncC family member, shows no homology with any previously described amidohydrolases. Multiple alignment analysis of functional and nonfunctional PncC homologs, together with NMN docking experiments, allowed us to tentatively identify the active site area and conserved residues therein. An observed broad phylogenomic distribution of predicted functional PncCs in the bacterial kingdom is consistent with a possible role in detoxification of NMN, resulting from NAD utilization by DNA ligase.",,"Active site; Amidohydrolase; Bacterial species; Cofactors; Comparative analysis; Conserved residues; Deletion mutants; DNA ligases; Enterobacteria; Key enzymes; Marine bacterium; Multiple alignment; Nicotinamide mononucleotide; Physiological functions; Pyridine nucleotides; Shewanella oneidensis; Three-dimensional structure; Amides; Bacteria; Coenzymes; Detoxification; Escherichia coli; Genes; Physiology; Purification; Pyridine; Nucleotides; amidase; bacterial protein; nicotinamide; nicotinamide nucleotide; nicotinamide nucleotide amidohydrolase; protein PncC; pyridine nucleotide; unclassified drug; amino acid sequence; article; bacterial gene; bacterial metabolism; controlled study; deletion mutant; enzyme activity; enzyme localization; Escherichia coli; functional genomics; gene sequence; genetic conservation; molecular docking; nonhuman; phenotype; phylogeny; pncC gene; priority journal; protein analysis; protein purification; residue analysis; sequence homology; Shewanella oneidensis; ygaD gene; Amidohydrolases; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli Proteins; Genome, Bacterial; NAD; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Shewanella; Bacteria (microorganisms); Enterobacteriaceae; Escherichia coli; Shewanella oneidensis",Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus

Physical maps are crucial tools for genome sequencing, gene mapping and cloning, genetic improvement and selective breeding. In this study, we have developed a genome-wide, BAC-based physical map for the species. A total of 81,408 clones from two BAC libraries of the scallop were fingerprinted using an ABI 3130xl Genetic Analyzer and a fingerprinting kit developed in our laboratory. After data processing, 63,641 (~5.8× genome coverage) fingerprints were validated and used in the physical map assembly. A total of 3,696 contigs were assembled for the physical map. Each contig contained an average of 10.0 clones, with an average physical size of 490 kb. The combined total physical size of all contigs was 1.81 Gb, equivalent to approximately 1.5 fold of the scallop haploid genome. A total of 10,587 BAC end sequences (BESs) and 167 markers were integrated into the physical map. We evaluated the physical map by overgo hybridization, BAC-FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization), contig BAC pool screening and source BAC library screening. The results have provided evidence of the high reliability of the contig physical map. This is the first physical map in mollusc; therefore, it provides an important platform for advanced research of genomics and genetics, and mapping of genes and QTL of economical importance, thus facilitating the genetic improvement and selective breeding of the scallop and other marine molluscs. © 2011 Zhang et al.",,"article; bacterial artificial chromosome; breeding; contig mapping; controlled study; DNA fingerprinting; fluorescence in situ hybridization; gene mapping; gene sequence; genetic analysis; genetic association; genetic parameters; molecular cloning; molecular library; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; physical map; process development; quantitative trait locus; reliability; scallop; unindexed sequence; animal; chromosome map; gene library; genetics; immunology; innate immunity; methodology; reproducibility; scallop; system analysis; Chlamys farreri; Mollusca; Animals; Chromosomes, Artificial, Bacterial; Cloning, Molecular; Contig Mapping; Gene Library; Immunity, Innate; Pectinidae; Physical Chromosome Mapping; Quantitative Trait Loci; Reproducibility of Results; Systems Integration",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

The emergence of infectious viral diseases, including iridovirus and betanodavirus, have severely affected food products based on this species, causing heavy economic losses. Limited available information on the genomics of E. coioides has hampered the understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie host-virus interactions. In this study, we used a 454 pyrosequencing method to investigate differentially-expressed genes in the spleen of the E. coioides infected with Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV).Results: Using 454 pyrosequencing, we obtained abundant high-quality ESTs from two spleen-complementary DNA libraries which were constructed from SGIV-infected (V) and PBS-injected fish (used as a control: C). A total of 407,027 and 421,141 ESTs were produced in control and SGIV infected libraries, respectively. Among the assembled ESTs, 9,616 (C) and 10,426 (V) ESTs were successfully matched against known genes in the NCBI non-redundant (nr) database with a cut-off E-value above 10-5. Gene ontology (GO) analysis indicated that ""cell part"", ""cellular process"" and ""binding"" represented the largest category. Among the 25 clusters of orthologous group (COG) categories, the cluster for ""translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis"" represented the largest group in the control (185 ESTs) and infected (172 ESTs) libraries. Further KEGG analysis revealed that pathways, including cellular metabolism and intracellular immune signaling, existed in the control and infected libraries. Comparative expression analysis indicated that certain genes associated with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), chemokine, toll-like receptor and RIG-I signaling pathway were alternated in response to SGIV infection. Moreover, changes in the pattern of gene expression were validated by qRT-PCR, including cytokines, cytokine receptors, and transcription factors, apoptosis-associated genes, and interferon related genes.Conclusion: This study provided abundant ESTs that could contribute greatly to disclosing novel genes in marine fish. Furthermore, the alterations of predicted gene expression patterns reflected possible responses of these fish to the virus infection.

The strain TY-2482 sequenced from this outbreak allowed the discovery of its closest relatives but failed to resolve ways in which it originated and evolved. On account of the previous statement, may we expect similar upcoming outbreaks to occur recurrently or spontaneously in the future? The inability to answer these questions shows limitations of the current comparative and evolutionary genomics methods. Principal Findings: The study revealed oscillations of gene exchange in enterobacteria, which originated from marine γ-Proteobacteria. These mobile genetic elements have become recombination hotspots and effective 'vehicles' ensuring a wide distribution of successful combinations of fitness and virulence genes among enterobacteria. Two remarkable peculiarities of the strain TY-2482 and its relatives were observed: i) retaining the genetic primitiveness by these strains as they somehow avoided the main fluxes of horizontal gene transfer which effectively penetrated other enetrobacteria; ii) acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes in a plasmid genomic island of β-Proteobacteria origin which ontologically is unrelated to the predominant genomic islands of enterobacteria. Conclusions: Oscillations of horizontal gene exchange activity were reported which result from a counterbalance between the acquired resistance of bacteria towards existing mobile vectors and the generation of new vectors in the environmental microflora. We hypothesized that TY-2482 may originate from a genetically primitive lineage of E. coli that has evolved in confined geographical areas and brought by human migration or cattle trade onto an intersection of several independent streams of horizontal gene exchange.

Extremophilic organisms from the deep-sea and cold environments are useful candidates for novel applications. Genomics and metagenomics are emerging as powerful tools in discovering useful genes. Application of organisms constitutes the second component of biotechnology. A search for candidate organisms for applications should be based on intelligent screening, while innovative applications of unique properties of organisms need to be established. The former is exemplified by novel drugs from coral reef invertebrates, marine polysaccharides and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Adhesive proteins of molluscs, biomimetics and nanolevel cell wall organization in diatoms are examples of intelligent applications. Process development and improvement for new and existing technologies are the final determinants of a technology. (2) The three levels are established, emerging and exploratory technologies. It is important to recognize this in order to decide who does what. (3) The key players are the academia and industries. Participation and collaboration of the two must be viewed in light of different levels of biotechnology. Improvement of established technologies belongs more to the realm of industries. Emerging technologies offer the best platform for their collaboration, while exploratory technologies are the domain of academic institutions.","Applications; Marine biotechnology; Organisms; Players; Processes","biotechnology; deep sea; ecosystem management; extremophile; fungus; genomics; harvesting; invertebrate; marine technology; phytoplankton; polysaccharide; protein; sustainability; technological development; Anthozoa; Bacillariophyta; Fungi; Invertebrata; Mollusca; Anthozoa; Bacillariophyta; Fungi; Invertebrata; Mollusca",Article,"",Scopus

Genome analysis reveals a complete TCA cycle, the ability to fix CO 2, carbon-storage proteins and a sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS). The latter could facilitate the transport of carbohydrates across the cell membrane and possibly aid in stalk formation, a matrix composed of exopolymers and/or exopolysaccharides, which is used to store oxidized iron minerals outside the cell. Two-component signal transduction system genes, including histidine kinases, GGDEF domain genes, and response regulators containing CheY-like receivers, are abundant and widely distributed across the genome. Most of these are located in close proximity to genes required for cell division, phosphate uptake and transport, exopolymer and heavy metal secretion, flagellar biosynthesis and pilus assembly suggesting that these functions are highly regulated. Similar to many other motile, microaerophilic bacteria, genes encoding aerotaxis as well as antioxidant functionality (e.g., superoxide dismutases and peroxidases) are predicted to sense and respond to oxygen gradients, as would be required to maintain cellular redox balance in the specialized habitat where M. ferrooxydans resides. Comparative genomics with other Fe(II) oxidizing bacteria residing in freshwater and marine environments revealed similar content, synteny, and amino acid similarity of coding sequences potentially involved in Fe(II) oxidation, signal transduction and response regulation, oxygen sensation and detoxification, and heavy metal resistance.

They are critical components of the world's freshwater and marine ecosystems, sensitive indicators of local and global climate change, key ecosystem service providers, parasites and predators of economically important aquatic animals and potential vectors of waterborne disease. Copepods sustain the world fisheries that nourish and support human populations. Although genomic tools have transformed many areas of biological and biomedical research, their power to elucidate aspects of the biology, behavior and ecology of copepods has only recently begun to be exploited.Discussion: The extraordinary biological and ecological diversity of the subclass Copepoda provides both unique advantages for addressing key problems in aquatic systems and formidable challenges for developing a focused genomics strategy. This article provides an overview of genomic studies of copepods and discusses strategies for using genomics tools to address key questions at levels extending from individuals to ecosystems. Genomics can, for instance, help to decipher patterns of genome evolution such as those that occur during transitions from free living to symbiotic and parasitic lifestyles and can assist in the identification of genetic mechanisms and accompanying physiological changes associated with adaptation to new or physiologically challenging environments. The adaptive significance of the diversity in genome size and unique mechanisms of genome reorganization during development could similarly be explored. Genome-wide and EST studies of parasitic copepods of salmon and large EST studies of selected free-living copepods have demonstrated the potential utility of modern genomics approaches for the study of copepods and have generated resources such as EST libraries, shotgun genome sequences, BAC libraries, genome maps and inbred lines that will be invaluable in assisting further efforts to provide genomics tools for copepods.Summary: Genomics research on copepods is needed to extend our exploration and characterization of their fundamental biological traits, so that we can better understand how copepods function and interact in diverse environments. Availability of large scale genomics resources will also open doors to a wide range of systems biology type studies that view the organism as the fundamental system in which to address key questions in ecology and evolution. © 2011 Bron et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Biological invasion; Diapause; Ecogenomics; Genome organization; Parasitism and symbiosis; Response to environmental change","Animalia; Copepoda; Metazoa",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

However, efforts to fully link a genotype to its phenotype remain limited to the development of one mutant at a time. In this study, we provided a highthroughput alternative to this limiting step by coupling comparative genomics to the use of phenotype arrays for five sequenced Shewanella strains. Positive phenotypes were obtained for 441 nutrients (C, N, P, and S sources), with N-based compounds being the most utilized for all strains. Many genes and pathways predicted by genome analyses were confirmed with the comparative phenotype assay, and three degradation pathways believed to be missing in Shewanella were confirmed as missing. A number of previously unknown gene products were predicted to be parts of pathways or to have a function, expanding the number of gene targets for future genetic analyses. Ecologically, the comparative high-throughput phenotype analysis provided insights into niche specialization among the five different strains. For example, Shewanella amazonensis strain SB2B, isolated from the Amazon River delta, was capable of utilizing 60C compounds, whereas Shewanella sp. strain W3-18-1, isolated from deep marine sediment, utilized only 25 of them. In spite of the large number of nutrient sources yielding positive results, our study indicated that except for the N sources, they were not sufficiently informative to predict growth phenotypes from increasing evolutionary distances.

The p53 protein and the two other members of this protein family (p63, p73) are encoded by distinct genes and their functions have been extensively documented for humans and some other vertebrates. The structure and relative expression levels for members of the p53 superfamily have also been reported for most major invertebrate taxa. The functions of homologous proteins have been investigated for only a few invertebrates (specifically, p53 in flies, nematodes and recently a sea anemone). These studies of classical model organisms all suggest that the gene family originally evolved to mediate apoptosis of damaged germ cells or to protect germ cells from genotoxic stress. Here, we have correlated data from a number of molluscan and other invertebrate sequencing projects to provide a framework for understanding p53 signalling pathways in marine bivalve cancer and stress biology. These data suggest that (a) the two identified p53 and p63/73-like proteins in soft shell clam (Mya arenaria), blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) and Northern European squid (Loligo forbesi) have identical core sequences and may be splice variants of a single gene, while some molluscs and most other invertebrates have two or more distinct genes expressing different p53 family members; (b) transcriptional activation domains (TADs) in bivalve p53 and p63/73-like protein sequences are 67-69% conserved with human p53, while those in ecdysozoan, cnidarian, placozoan and choanozoan eukaryotes are ≤33% conserved; (c) the Mdm2 binding site in the transcriptional activation domain is 100% conserved in all sequenced bivalve p53 proteins (e.g. Mya, Mytilus, Crassostrea and Spisula) but is not present in other non-deuterostome invertebrates; (d) an Mdm2 homologue has been cloned for Mytilus trossulus; (e) homologues for both human p53 upstream regulatory and transcriptional target genes exist in molluscan genomes (missing are ARF, CIP1 and BH3 only proteins) and (f) p53 is demonstrably involved in bivalve haemocyte and germinoma cancers. We usually do not know enough about the molecular biology of marine invertebrates to address molecular mechanisms that characterize particular diseases. Understanding the molecular basis of naturally occurring diseases in marine bivalves is a virtually unexplored aspect of toxicoproteomics and genomics and related drug discovery. Additionally, increases in coastal development and concomitant increases in aquatic pollutants have driven interest in developing models appropriate for evaluating potential hazardous compounds or conditions found in the aquatic environment. Data reviewed in this study are coupled with recent developments in our understanding the molecular biology of the marine bivalve p53 superfamily. Taken together, they suggest that both structurally and functionally, bivalve p53 family proteins are the most highly conserved members of this gene superfamily so far identified outside of higher vertebrates and invertebrate chordates.

Consequently, massively parallel 454 sequencing was used to characterize a normalized cDNA library derived from skin biopsy samples of twelve Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) individuals. Over 412Mb of sequence data were generated, comprising 1.4million reads of average length 286bp. De novo assembly using Newbler 2.3 yielded 156 contigs plus 22869 isotigs, which in turn clustered into 18576 isogroups. Almost half of the assembled transcript sequences showed significant similarity to the nr database, revealing a functionally diverse array of genes. Moreover, 97.9% of these mapped to the dog (Canis lupis familiaris) genome, with a strong positive relationship between the number of sequences locating to a given chromosome and the length of that chromosome in the dog indicating a broad genomic distribution. Average depth of coverage was also almost 20-fold, sufficient to detect several thousand putative microsatellite loci and single nucleotide polymorphisms. This study constitutes an important step towards developing genomic resources with which to address consequential questions in pinniped ecology and evolution.

Both species were isolated from seaweed and are able to perform aerobic anoxygenic photosynthesis.Results: The genome of R. litoralis OCh149 contains one circular chromosome of 4,505,211 bp and three plasmids of 93,578 bp (pRLO149_94), 83,129 bp (pRLO149_83) and 63,532 bp (pRLO149_63). Of the 4537 genes predicted for R. litoralis, 1122 (24.7%) are not present in the genome of R. denitrificans. Many of the unique genes of R. litoralis are located in genomic islands and on plasmids. On pRLO149_83 several potential heavy metal resistance genes are encoded which are not present in the genome of R. denitrificans. The comparison of the heavy metal tolerance of the two organisms showed an increased zinc tolerance of R. litoralis. In contrast to R. denitrificans, the photosynthesis genes of R. litoralis are plasmid encoded. The activity of the photosynthetic apparatus was confirmed by respiration rate measurements, indicating a growth-phase dependent response to light. Comparative genomics with other members of the Roseobacter clade revealed several genomic regions that were only conserved in the two Roseobacter species. One of those regions encodes a variety of genes that might play a role in host association of the organisms. The catabolism of different carbon and nitrogen sources was predicted from the genome and combined with experimental data. In several cases, e.g. the degradation of some algal osmolytes and sugars, the genome-derived predictions of the metabolic pathways in R. litoralis differed from the phenotype.Conclusions: The genomic differences between the two Roseobacter species are mainly due to lateral gene transfer and genomic rearrangements. Plasmid pRLO149_83 contains predominantly recently acquired genetic material whereas pRLO149_94 was probably translocated from the chromosome. Plasmid pRLO149_63 and one plasmid of R. denitrifcans (pTB2) seem to have a common ancestor and are important for cell envelope biosynthesis. Several new mechanisms of substrate degradation were indicated from the combination of experimental and genomic data. The photosynthetic activity of R. litoralis is probably regulated by nutrient availability. © 2011 Kalhoefer et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"nitrogen; sugar; zinc; glycogen; heavy metal; article; bacterial chromosome; bacterial gene; bacterial genome; bacterial growth; carbon metabolism; catabolism; cladistics; controlled study; gene function; gene location; gene rearrangement; gene transfer; genetic association; genetic conservation; genetic difference; genome analysis; genomic island; heavy metal resistance gene; host range; nonhuman; photosynthesis; photosynthesis gene; plasmid; Roseobacter; Roseobacter denitrificans; Roseobacter litoralis; species difference; type strain; bacterial genome; chemistry; comparative study; genetics; metabolism; molecular genetics; physiology; algae; Roseobacter; Roseobacter denitrificans; Roseobacter litoralis; Genome, Bacterial; Genomic Islands; Glycogen; Metals, Heavy; Molecular Sequence Data; Photosynthesis; Plasmids; Roseobacter; Species Specificity",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

We found 899 ESTs that harbor 997 SSRs (4.94%). On average, one SSR was found per 2.95. kb of EST sequence and the dinucleotide SSRs are the most abundant accounting for 47.6% of the total number.EST-SSRs were used as template for primer design. 664 primer pairs could be successfully identified and a subset of 206 pairs of primers was synthesized, PCR-tested and visualized on ethidium bromide stained agarose gels. The main objective was to further assess the potential of EST-SSRs as informative markers and investigate their cross-species amplification in sixteen teleost fish species: seven sparid species and nine other species from different families. Approximately 78% of the primer pairs gave PCR products of expected size in gilthead sea bream, and as expected, the rate of successful amplification of sea bream EST-SSRs was higher in sparids, lower in other perciforms and even lower in species of the Clupeiform and Gadiform orders.

Deviations from additivity should be explained either by the perturbations of toxicokinetic parameters and/or chemical toxicodynamics. We addressed this important question in marine mussels exposed subchronically to a binary mixture made of two wide-spread pollutants: the heavy metal nickel and the organic phosphorus pesticide Chlorpyrifos. To this aim, we carried out in tissues of Mytius galloprovincialis (Lam) a systems approach based on the evaluation and integration of different disciplines, i.e. high throughput gene expression profiling, functional genomics, stress biomakers and toxicokinetics.Results: Cellular and tissue biomarkers, viz. digestive gland lysosomal membrane stability, lysosomal/cytosol volume ratio, neutral lipid content and gill acetylcholinesterase activity were, in general, altered by either the exposure to nickel and Chlorpyrifos. However, their joint action rendered (i) an overall decrease of the stress syndrome level, as evaluated through an expert system integrating biomarkers and (ii) statistically significant antagonistic deviations from the reference model systems to predict mixture toxicity. While toxicokinetic modeling did not explain mixture interactions, gene expression profiling and further Gene Ontology-based functional genomics analysis provided clues that the decrement of toxicity may arise from the development of specific toxicodynamics. Multivariate statistics of microarray data (238 genes in total, representing about 14% of the whole microarray catalogue) showed two separate patterns for the single chemicals: the one belonging to the heavy metal -135 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was characterized by the modulation of transcript levels involved in nucleic acid metabolism, cell proliferation and lipid metabolic processes. Chlorpyrifos exposure (43 DEGs) yielded a molecular signature which was biased towards carbohydrate catabolism (indeed, chitin metabolism) and developmental processes. The exposure to the mixture (103 DEGs) elicited a composite complex profile which encompassed the core properties of the pesticide but also a relevant set of unique features. Finally, the relative mRNA abundance of twelve genes was followed by Q-PCR to either confirm or complement microarray data. These results, in general, were compatible with those from arrays and indeed confirmed the association of the relative abundance of two GM-2 ganglioside activator genes in the development of the hyperlipidosis syndrome observed in digestive gland lysosomes of single chemical exposed mussels.Conclusion: The transcriptomic assessment fitted with biological data to indicate the occurrence of different toxicodynamic events and, in general, a decrease of toxicity, driven by the mitigation or even abolition of lysosomal responses. Furthermore, our results emphasized the importance of the application of mechanistic approaches and the power of systems assessment to study toxicological responses in ecologically relevant organisms. © 2011 Dondero et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"acetylcholinesterase; carbohydrate; chitin; chlorpyrifos; heavy metal; lipid; messenger RNA; nickel; pesticide; biological marker; chlorpyrifos; insecticide; nickel; article; carbohydrate metabolism; catabolism; cell proliferation; chemical interaction; chemical stress; controlled study; cytosol; enzyme activity; exocrine gland; functional genomics; gene; gene expression profiling; GM 2 ganglioside activator gene; high throughput screening; hyperlipidosis syndrome; lipid metabolism; lipidosis; lysosome membrane; microarray analysis; mussel; Mytius galloprovinciallis; nonhuman; nucleic acid metabolism; nucleotide sequence; prediction; toxicokinetics; transcriptomics; animal; bivalve; chemistry; drug effect; drug potentiation; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; kinetics; metabolism; risk assessment; water pollutant; Bivalvia; Mytilidae; Animals; Biological Markers; Bivalvia; Chlorpyrifos; Drug Synergism; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Insecticides; Kinetics; Nickel; Risk Assessment; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

During the last decade, this has expanded from single genes to microbial community genomics, or metagenomics, in which the gene content of an environment can provide not just a census of the community members but direct information on metabolic capabilities and potential interactions among community members. Here we introduce a method for the quantitative characterization and comparison of microbial communities based on the normalization of metagenomic data by estimating average genome sizes. This normalization can relieve comparative biases introduced by differences in community structure, number of sequencing reads, and sequencing read lengths between different metagenomes. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by comparing metagenomes from two different marine sources using both conventional small-subunit (SSU) rRNA gene analyses and our quantitative method to calculate the proportion of genomes in each sample that are capable of a particular metabolic trait. With both environments, to determine what proportion of each community they make up and how differences in environment affect their abundances, we characterize three different types of autotrophic organisms: aerobic, photosynthetic carbon fixers (the Cyanobacteria); anaerobic, photosynthetic carbon fixers (the Chlorobi); and anaerobic, nonphotosynthetic carbon fixers (the Desulfobacteraceae). These analyses demonstrate how genome proportionality compares to SSU rRNA gene relative abundance and how factors such as average genome size and SSU rRNA gene copy number affect sampling probability and therefore both types of community analysis. © 2011, American Society for Microbiology.",,"Community analysis; Community structures; Gene content; Genome sizes; Genomics; Marine sources; Metabolic capabilities; Metagenomes; Metagenomic analysis; Metagenomics; Microbial communities; Quantitative characterization; Quantitative method; Relative abundance; RRna genes; Metabolism; RNA; Genes; RNA 16S; autotrophy; community structure; genetic analysis; genome; metabolism; microbial community; mitochondrial DNA; probability; quantitative analysis; relative abundance; article; bacterial load; Chlorobi; cyanobacterium; Deltaproteobacteria; evaluation; genetics; metagenome; metagenomics; methodology; microbiological examination; microbiology; standard; Bacterial Load; Chlorobi; Cyanobacteria; Deltaproteobacteria; Environmental Microbiology; Metagenome; Metagenomics; Microbiological Techniques; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Chlorobi; Cyanobacteria; Desulfobacteraceae",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

Seven Photobacterium species are luminous via the activity of the lux genes, luxCDABEG. Much recent progress has been made on the phylogeny, genomics, and symbiosis of Photobacterium. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates a robust separation between Photobacterium and its close relatives, Aliivibrio and Vibrio, and reveals the presence of two well-supported clades. Clade 1 contains luminous and symbiotic species and one species with no luminous members, and Clade 2 contains mostly nonluminous species. The genomes of Photobacterium are similar in size, structure, and organization to other members of Vibrionaceae, with two chromosomes of unequal size and multiple rrn operons. Many species of marine fish form bioluminescent symbioses with three Photobacterium species: Photobacterium kishitanii, Photobacterium leiognathi, and Photobacterium mandapamensis.

The shape of caudal is an important parameter in traditional systematics. However, little is known about genes involved in the development of different forms of caudal fins. This study was conducted to identify and map quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting the length of caudal fin and the ratio between tail length and standard body length in Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer). One F1 family containing 380 offspring was generated by crossing two unrelated individuals. One hundred and seventeen microsatellites almost evenly distributed along the whole genome were genotyped. Length of caudal fin at 90 days post-hatch was measured. QTL analysis detected six significant (genome-wide significant) and two suggestive (linkage-group-wide significant) QTL on seven linkage groups. The six significant QTL explained 5.5-16.6% of the phenotypic variance, suggesting these traits were controlled by multiple genes. Comparative genomics analysis identified several potential candidate genes for the length of caudal fin.

In this study, we systematically evaluated protocols for the preservation (RNA. later, liquid nitrogen, lyophilized, frozen) and extraction (CTAB-based DNA extraction, RNA isolation via TRIzol and two co-extraction methods) of nucleic acids using samples of the New Zealand high-microbial-abundance sponge Ancorina alata. The quantity and quality of nucleic acids were assessed via spectrophotometry, agarose gel electrophoresis and microcapillary electrophoresis. Although all protocols resulted in sufficiently high DNA and/or RNA quantity and quality for downstream applications, there were significant differences in yield of nucleic acids extracted. All RNA extraction methods maintained mRNA of sufficient integrity to amplify the prokaryotic glutamine synthetase gene. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of community 16S rRNA gene- and 16S rRNA-derived fragments revealed several unique bands in the rRNA-derived profiles. However, there were no major changes attributable to either preservation or extraction method. Optimized methods were successfully tested on three other New Zealand sponges.

Over the last decade, conopeptides have proven indispensable reagents for the study of vertebrate neurotransmission. Conus bullatus belongs to a clade of Conus species called Textilia, whose pharmacology is still poorly characterized. Thus the genomics analyses presented here provide the first step toward a better understanding the enigmatic Textilia clade.Results: We have carried out a sequencing survey of the Conus bullatus genome and venom-duct transcriptome. We find that conopeptides are highly expressed within the venom-duct, and describe an in silico pipeline for their discovery and characterization using RNA-seq data. We have also carried out low-coverage shotgun sequencing of the genome, and have used these data to determine its size, genome-wide base composition, simple repeat, and mobile element densities.Conclusions: Our results provide the first global view of venom-duct transcription in any cone snail. A notable feature of Conus bullatus venoms is the breadth of A-superfamily peptides expressed in the venom duct, which are unprecedented in their structural diversity. We also find SNP rates within conopeptides are higher compared to the remainder of C. bullatus transcriptome, consistent with the hypothesis that conopeptides are under diversifying selection. © 2011 Hu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"conopeptide; peptide; RNA; snail venom; transcriptome; unclassified drug; mollusc venom; peptide; animal anatomy; article; cladistics; computer model; controlled study; Conus bullatus; DNA base composition; gene expression; gene location; genetic database; genome analysis; genome size; nonhuman; RNA sequence; single nucleotide polymorphism; species comparison; toxic snail; venome duct; animal; Conus snail; gene expression profiling; genetics; genome; molecular genetics; Conus bullatus; Gastropoda; Vertebrata; Animals; Base Composition; Conus Snail; Gene Expression Profiling; Genome; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Mollusk Venoms; Peptides",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

The ocean also moderates climate and contributes substantially to the U.S. economy. However, the ocean poses risks when people are exposed to disease-causing organisms trans-mitted through or originating in the marine environment, toxins from harmful algal blooms (HABs) and other microorganisms, chemical contaminants, and when catastrophic events such as hurricanes and tsunamis occur. Because the close connection between ocean ecosystem conditions and human health has long been recognized, several federal agencies have been working on oceans and human health (OHH)-related problems for many years. Ongoing activities and interagency collaborations have included programs related to seafood and drinking water safety, drug discovery, pollution effects and control, HABs and the toxins they produce, occurrence and transmission of disease-causing agents, and numerous others. However, the advent of named OHH programs, specifically the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Oceans and Human Health Initiative (OHHI) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) and National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences' (NIEHS) Research Centers of Excellence in OHH, has led to substantially increased progress in OHH research and its useful application, and in partnering among federal agencies, academia, states, and the private sector. Federal agencies collaborating on OHH research, in addition to NOAA, NSF, and NIEHS, include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Marine Mammal Commission (MMC), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). To coordinate ongoing OHH research efforts and to ensure that federal investments in this emerging and important interdisciplinary scientific field are utilized as efficiently as possible, in 2004 the U.S. Congress passed the Oceans and Human Health Act that formally established the Interagency OHH Program. The Act also explicitly calls for this ten-year implementation plan and states that its purpose is to define ""the goals and priorities for Federal research which most effectively advance scientific understanding of the connections between the oceans and human health, provide usable information for the prediction of marine-related public health problems, and use the biological potential of the oceans for development of new treatments of human diseases and a greater understanding of human biology."" In fall 2005, the Joint Subcommittee on Ocean Science and Technology (JSOST) of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) Committee on Science and the Committee on Environment and Natural Resources and the Interagency Committee on Ocean Science and Resource Management Integration (ICOSRMI) established the Interagency Working Group on Harmful Algal Blooms, Hypoxia, and Human Health (IWG-4H). One of the IWG-4H's principal tasks has been to develop this implementation plan. This plan complements and expands upon the OHH-related priorities detailed in ""Charting the Course for Ocean Science in the United States for the Next Decade: An Ocean Research Priorities Plan and Implementation Strategy"" prepared by the JSOST and published in early 2007, and provides a framework for implementation of a national OHH research and outreach program. It also summarizes work underway in NOAA's OHHI and the NSF-NIEHS Centers in OHH, and provides synopses of ongoing related work in the CDC, EPA, FDA, MMC, NASA and USGS (see Chapter 2 for details). In preparing this implementation plan, the IWG-4H focused on three broad goals of the Interagency OHH Program. 1) Establish a research agenda focused on the highest priority areas and activities, the appropriate mix of supporting infrastructure, and the transition of research to useful application and outreach. 2) Promote a robust interdisciplinary approach that links marine and biomedical sciences to create a fundamentally new OHH research community with the breadth of expertise required to address diverse human health questions within the complexity of ocean systems. 3) Establish and expand collaborative partnerships to develop and effectively use OHH information and products through technology transfer and training, and ensure inclusion of OHH-supportive data collection, integration, analysis, and modeling within the larger framework of national and international ocean observation efforts. To accomplish our vision of a future where a healthy ocean allows people to benefit from a variety of ocean products and to swim, fish, or otherwise recreate in ocean waters and eat seafood without risk of exposure to disease-causing organisms and compounds, federal agencies and their academic and other partners should concentrate efforts where significant opportunities for advancement to improve and/or protect human health have been identified. These are: 1) Priority research dealing with pathogens, chemical contaminants, HABs, seafood safety, pharmaceuticals and other beneficial products and in cross-cutting areas such as epidemiology, sentinel species, genomics and related technologies, and social, behavioral and economic sciences. 2) Appropriate infrastructure to support research advances in such areas as linking to the ocean observing systems, data management and access, development of standards and standardized methods, and access to the sea. 3) Transition of research results to applications through targeted outreach and education activities and development of rapid response capabilities. In addition, the IWG-4H identified the following six implementation actions that the federal agencies involved in the Interagency OHH Program will take to advance OHH research and application, leading to reduced health risks and increased health benefits for people. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Most importantly, higher trophic levels suchas fish and marine mammals depend on short food chains driven by bloom-formingphytoplankton. Past genetic work on marine phytoplankton has mainly focused ondescriptive studies, inferring the extent of biodiversity at or below the species level. Morerecently, the development of new genetic tools and the sequence of full genomes of ahandful of phytoplankton species allowed a breakthrough in functional genomics anddeveloped insights into key ecological processes, such as toxin metabolism, cell mortalityprocesses, and DMSO metabolism.While these latter results represent an encouraging step forward in our understandingof phytoplankton communities, the link between biodiversity and the functioning ofpelagic ecosystems is still missing. To interpret the biological processes drivingbiodiversity, a mechanistic understanding of single gene effects in natural populationsand their feedback at community level is required. This can be achieved with the help ofmesocosms (controlled environments), which scale up nicely to natural environments.Marine phytoplanktons have been considered for a long time as geneticallyhomogeneous throughout their distributional range. However, recent evidence hasquestioned the idea that everything is everywhere, suggesting instead a spatial andtemporal compartmentalization of phytoplankton communities, despite elevated geneflow. This calls for a completely new view of the 'once-thought simple' phytoplankton community dynamics. First, the temporal and spatial compartmentalization ofphytoplankton communities strongly suggests that marine ecosystems should beconsidered as a group of communities connected by different levels of dispersal, whichtranslates in differential gene flow between partially-isolated communities. This wouldsuggest that the dispersal-gene flow paradox typical of standing aquatic ecosystems maybe applicable to marine ecosystems as well. Secondly, the striking bottom-up effect inmarine ecosystems, as demonstrated by the control operated by phytoplankton onzooplankton demography, suggests that changes in phytoplankton genetic diversity canbe expected to induce a chain effect to higher trophic levels. This concept, known as'extended phenotype', predicts that genes have phenotypes that extend beyond theindividual to have community and ecosystem consequences. © 2009 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Marine phytoplankton are phylogenetically diverse and are comprised of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic species. In the last decade, new insights have been gained into the ecology and evolution of these important organisms through whole genome sequencing projects and more recently, through both transcriptomics and targeted metagenomics approaches. Sequenced genomes of cyanobacteria are generally small, ranging in size from 1.8 to 9 million base pairs (Mbp). Eukaryotic genomes, in general, have a much larger size range and those that have been sequenced range from 12 to 57. Mbp. Whole genome sequencing projects have revealed key features of the evolutionary history of marine phytoplankton, their varied responses to environmental stress, their ability to scavenge and store nutrients and their unique ability to form elaborate cellular coverings. We have begun to learn how to read the 'language' of marine phytoplankton, as written in their DNA.

The challenge is to describe the mechanisms of regeneration at the molecular level, delivering detailed insights into the many components that are cross-regulated. In other words, a broad, yet deep dissection of the system-wide network of molecular interactions is needed. Functional genomics has been used to elucidate gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in developing tissues, which, like regeneration, are complex systems. Therefore, we reason that the GRN approach, aided by next generation technologies, can also be applied to study the molecular mechanisms underlying the complex functions of regeneration. We ask what characteristics a model system must have to support a GRN analysis. Our discussion focuses on regeneration in the central nervous system, where loss of function has particularly devastating consequences for an organism. We examine a cohort of cells conserved across all vertebrates, the reticulospinal (RS) neurons, which lend themselves well to experimental manipulations. In the lamprey, a jawless vertebrate, there are giant RS neurons whose large size and ability to regenerate make them particularly suited for a GRN analysis. Adding to their value, a distinct subset of lamprey RS neurons reproducibly fail to regenerate, presenting an opportunity for side-by-side comparison of gene networks that promote or inhibit regeneration. Thus, determining the GRN for regeneration in RS neurons will provide a mechanistic understanding of the fundamental cues that lead to success or failure to regenerate. © 2011 Marine Biological Laboratory.",,"cohort analysis; genetic analysis; genomics; molecular analysis; nervous system; neurology; vertebrate; Petromyzontidae; Vertebrata",Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus

Marine stramenopiles (MAS), which are a diverse assemblage of algae that acquired photosynthesis from secondary endosymbiosis, include single-celled organisms such as diatoms as well as multicellular forms such as brown algae. The recent publication of two diatom genomes that diverged ~90 million years ago (mya), as well as the one of a brown algae that diverged from diatoms ~250 Mya, provide a great system of related, yet diverged set of organisms to compare epigenetic marks and their relationships. For example, putative DNA methyltransferase homologues were found in diatoms while none could be identified in the brown algal genome. On the other hand, no canonical DICER-like protein was found in diatoms in contrast to what is observed in brown algae. A key interest relies in understanding the adaptive nature of epigenetics and its inheritability. In contrast to yeast that lack DNA methylation, homogeneous cultures of diatoms constitute an attractive system to study epigenetic changes in response to environmental conditions such as nutrient-rich to nutrient-poor transitions which is especially relevant because of their ecological importance. P. tricornutum is also of outstanding interest because it is observed as three different morphotypes and thus constitutes a simple and promising model for the study of the epigenetic phenomena that accompany cellular differentiation.

The microbial consortia of the Mediterranean sponge Aplysina aerophoba were singularized by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and individual microbial cells were subjected to phi29 polymerase-mediated whole-genome amplification. Pyrosequencing of a single amplified genome (SAG) derived from a member of the Poribacteria resulted in nearly 1.6 Mb of genomic information distributed among 554 contigs analyzed in this study. Approximately two-third of the poribacterial genome was sequenced. Our findings shed light on the functional properties and lifestyle of a possibly ancient bacterial symbiont of marine sponges. The Poribacteria are mixotrophic bacteria with autotrophic CO 2-fixation capacities through the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. The cell wall is of Gram-negative origin. The Poribacteria produce at least two polyketide synthases (PKSs), one of which is the sponge-specific Sup-type PKS. Several putative symbiosis factors such as adhesins (bacterial Ig-like domains, lamininin G domain proteins), adhesin-related proteins (ankyrin, fibronectin type III) and tetratrico peptide repeat domain-encoding proteins were identified, which might be involved in mediating sponge-microbe interactions. The discovery of genes coding for 24-isopropyl steroids implies that certain fossil biomarkers used to date the origins of metazoan life on earth may possibly be of poribacterial origin. Single-cell genomic approaches, such as those shown herein, contribute to a better understanding of beneficial microbial consortia, of which most members are, because of the lack of cultivation, inaccessible by conventional techniques.","marine; Poribacteria; single-cell genomics; sponge; symbiosis","polyketide synthase; sterol; bacterium; biomarker; carbon dioxide; cell organelle; enzyme activity; fluorescence; gene expression; genome; genomics; marine environment; peptide; polymerase chain reaction; protein; sponge; symbiosis; animal; article; bacterial genome; bacterial phenomena and functions; bacterium; biosynthesis; classification; genetics; genomics; metabolism; microbiology; molecular genetics; phylogeny; sponge (Porifera); symbiosis; Animals; Bacteria; Bacterial Physiological Phenomena; Genome, Bacterial; Genomics; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Polyketide Synthases; Porifera; Sterols; Symbiosis; Mediterranean Sea; Aplysina aerophoba; Bacteria (microorganisms); Candidatus Poribacteria; Metazoa; Negibacteria",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus

There is increasing evidence indicating that nutritional genomics represents a promise to improve marine health. This goal will be reached by highlighting the mechanisms through which diet can reduce the risk of monogenic and common polygenic diseases. Indeed, nutrition is a very relevant environmental factor involved in the development and progression of metabolic disorders as well as other kind of diseases. To date, it is widely accepted that most of the effects of the nutrition on shrimp diseases and in turn, on marine health cannot be easily explained without a complete knowledge of the molecular mechanism underlying the nutrients action.

Understanding the complex abiotic and biotic processes on the micro- to macroscale is the key to protect and sustain the marine ecosystem. Marine microorganisms are the 'gatekeepers' of the biotic processes that control the global cycles of energy and organic matter. A multinational, multidisciplinary approach, bringing together research on oceanography, biodiversity and genomics, is now needed to understand and finally predict the complex responses of the marine ecosystem to ongoing global changes. Such an integrative approach will not only bring better understanding of the complex interplay of the organisms with their environment, but will reveal a wealth of new metabolic processes and functions, which have a high potential for biotechnological applications. This potential has already been recognized by the European commission which funded a series of workshops and projects on marine genomics in the sixth and seventh framework programme. Nevertheless, there remain many obstacles to achieving the goal - such as a lack of bioinformatics tailored for the marine field, consistent data acquisition and exchange, as well as continuous monitoring programmes and a lack of relevant marine bacterial models.

Both act selectively as agonist of the insect nicotinic-Acetylcholine Receptor (nAChR) and therefore, by definition, they hold the same mode of action. Notwithstanding the growing attention to the ecotoxicological effects of neonicotinoids, there is a lack of information on their toxicodynamics and their mixture effects, in particular, in aquatic organisms. Objectives: The main objectives of this work were: (i) assess sublethal effects of two neonicotinoids-Imidacloprid and Thiacloprid-in the tissues of the marine mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis Lam.); (ii) identify the molecular dynamics elicited by the two chemicals through gene/protein expression profiling and a functional genomics approach; (iii) assess the effects of a neonicotinoid binary mixture. Methods: Sublethal effects were measured by means of digestive gland lysosomal membrane stability (LMS) and gill acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. Gene expression profiles were evaluated in the digestive gland using a 1.7. K cDNA microarray and quantitative-PCR (Q-PCR). Proteome profiling was performed by means of two-dimensional electrophoresis of digestive gland cytosolic proteins. Functional genomics was based on the over-representation of Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Results and discussion: Our results showed that (i) biomarkers responded in the micromolar range; (ii) Imidacloprid and Thiacloprid elicited distinct toxicodynamics as depicted by the different transcriptomic and proteomic profiles and the opposite trend of AChE activity; (iii) at biomarkers level, the joint effects of the two chemicals appeared to fulfill the principle of independence, but this was less evident at molecular level where a novel specific molecular signature took place. Conclusions: These findings imply that different toxicodynamics may occur also as a response of chemicals with the same mode of action. Our results unveil also the incongruousness of the actual concept of pesticide mode of action in the context of ecological risk assessment analysis of chemical mixtures. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Functional genomics; Imidacloprid; Metallothioneins; Microarrays; Mixture toxicity; Mode of action; Proteomics; Thiacloprid","Functional genomics; Imidacloprids; Metallothioneins; Mixture toxicity; Mode of action; Proteomics; Aquaculture; Binary mixtures; Chemicals; Electrophoresis; Gene expression; Insecticides; Microarrays; Molecular biology; Molecular dynamics; Ontology; Proteins; Risk analysis; Risk management; Toxicity; Risk assessment; acetylcholinesterase; biological marker; cell protein; imidacloprid; insecticide; thiacloprid; unclassified drug; biomarker; DNA; ecotoxicology; electrokinesis; gene expression; genomics; insecticide; mollusc; polymerase chain reaction; protein; toxicity; article; controlled study; DNA microarray; ecotoxicology; enzyme activity; exocrine gland; functional genomics; gene expression profiling; lethality; lysosome membrane; molecular dynamics; mussel; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; protein expression; proteomics; toxicity testing; transcriptomics; unindexed sequence; Animals; Biological Markers; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profiling; Imidazoles; Insecticides; Mytilus; Nitro Compounds; Proteome; Pyridines; Thiazines; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Hexapoda; Mytilidae; Mytilus galloprovincialis",Article,"",Scopus

Abundance, production and respiration of prokaryotes reflect supplies of particulate and dissolved organic matter to the bathypelagic zone. Better resolution of carbon fluxes mediated by deep microbes requires further testing on the validity of conversion factors. Archaea, especially marine Crenarchaeota Group I, are abundant in deep waters where they can fix dissolved inorganic carbon. Viruses appear to be important in the microbial loop in deep waters, displaying remarkably high virus to prokaryote abundance ratios in some oceanic regions. Sequencing of 18S rRNA genes revealed a tremendous diversity of small-sized protists in bathypelagic waters. Abundances of heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) and ciliates decrease with depth more steeply than prokaryotes; nonetheless, data indicated that HNF consumed half of prokaryote production in the bathypelagic zone. Aggregates are important habitats for deep-water microbes, which produce more extracellular enzymes (on a per-cell basis) than surface communities. The theory of marine gel formation provides a framework to unravel complex interactions between microbes and organic polymers. Recent data on the effects of hydrostatic pressure on microbial activities indicate that bathypelagic microbial activity is generally higher under in situ pressure conditions than at atmospheric pressures. High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes revealed a remarkable diversity of Bacteria in the bathypelagic ocean. Metagenomics and comparative genomics of piezophiles reveal not only the high diversity of deep sea microbes but also specific functional attributes of these piezophilic microbes, interpreted as an adaptation to the deep water environment. Taken together, the data compiled on bathypelagic microbes indicate that, despite high-pressure and low-temperature conditions, microbes in the bathypelagic ocean dynamically interact with complex mixtures of organic matter, responding to changes in the ocean's biogeochemical state. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Bathypelagic zone; Biogeochemistry; Genomics; Microbial loop; Organic matter; Piezophile","16S rRNA gene; 18s rRNA; Abundance ratios; Archaea; Bathypelagic zone; Carbon fluxes; Comparative genomics; Complex interaction; Complex mixture; Conversion factor; Crenarchaeota; Deep sea; Deep Water; Dissolved inorganic carbon; Dissolved organic matters; Extracellular enzymes; Functional attribute; Gel formation; Genomics; High-throughput; In-situ; Low temperatures; Metagenomics; Microbial activities; Microbial distribution; Microbial loop; Microbial process; Nanoflagellates; Oceanic regions; Organic matter; Pressure conditions; Agglomeration; Atmospheric pressure; Bacteria; Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Dissolution; Gels; Genes; Hydrostatic pressure; Oceanography; RNA; Viruses; Organic polymers; abundance; biogeochemistry; biological production; dissolved inorganic carbon; gene expression; genomics; microbial activity; particulate organic matter; pelagic environment; prokaryote; protist; respiration; species diversity; virus; Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms); Ciliophora; Crenarchaeota; Prokaryota; Protista",Article,"",Scopus

Toxins from marine, brackish and freshwater environments, which are often produced as a result of harmful algal blooms, have been implicated as the causative agents of these poisonings. Commonly, poisoning events have been grouped into one of six classes, Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP), Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning (DSP), Neurotoxic Shellfish Poisoning (NSP), Ciguatera Fish Poisoning (CFP), Azaspiracid Shellfish Poisoning (AZP), and Amnesiac Shellfish Poisoning (ASP). The causative agents of these specific poisonings along with their biosyntheses are discussed in this review. The highly unusual and complex structures of most common seafood toxins have made them interesting targets for biosynthetic studies. Many of the toxins presented are biosynthesized via complex pathways that have been elucidated either through isotope labelled precursor feeding studies and/or characterization of the genes encoding the producing organism's biosynthetic machinery. Feeding studies key to our understanding of a particular toxin's biosynthesis, such as the incorporation of unusual precursors, as well as unique biosynthetic pathways and rare chemical mechanisms involved in the assembly process are highlighted. More recently, however, modern genomics-based techniques have been used for the elucidation of biosynthetic pathways and these are presented in the context of polyketide, non-ribosomal peptide, and hybrid pathway derived, toxin assembly. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.","Brevetoxin; Ciguatoxin; Cyanobacteria; Harmful algal blooms; Marine algae; Nonribosomal peptide; Polyether; Polyketide; Saxitoxin; Tetrodotoxin; Toxin biosynthesis","azaspiracid; brevetoxin; ciguatoxin; cylindrospermopsin; domoic acid; fresh water; marine toxin; nodularin; okadaic acid; polyketide; saxitoxin; tetrodotoxin; algal bloom; article; chemical structure; ciguatera; diarrhea; epidemic; food contamination; food industry; food intake; freshwater environment; human; hybridization; isotope labeling; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; paralysis; priority journal; sea food; shellfish poisoning; toxin synthesis; Animals; Dinoflagellida; Disease Outbreaks; Food Contamination; Foodborne Diseases; Genomics; Harmful Algal Bloom; Humans; Marine Toxins; Neurotoxins; Shellfish; Shellfish Poisoning; algae; Ciguatera; Cyanobacteria",Article,"",Scopus

The consistent capture and structured submission of these data is crucial for integrated data analysis and ecosystems modeling. The application MetaBar has been developed, to support consistent contextual data acquisition.Results: MetaBar is a spreadsheet and web-based software tool designed to assist users in the consistent acquisition, electronic storage, and submission of contextual data associated to their samples. A preconfigured Microsoft®Excel®spreadsheet is used to initiate structured contextual data storage in the field or laboratory. Each sample is given a unique identifier and at any stage the sheets can be uploaded to the MetaBar database server. To label samples, identifiers can be printed as barcodes. An intuitive web interface provides quick access to the contextual data in the MetaBar database as well as user and project management capabilities. Export functions facilitate contextual and sequence data submission to the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC), comprising of the DNA DataBase of Japan (DDBJ), the European Molecular Biology Laboratory database (EMBL) and GenBank. MetaBar requests and stores contextual data in compliance to the Genomic Standards Consortium specifications. The MetaBar open source code base for local installation is available under the GNU General Public License version 3 (GNU GPL3).Conclusion: The MetaBar software supports the typical workflow from data acquisition and field-sampling to contextual data enriched sequence submission to an INSDC database. The integration with the megx.net marine Ecological Genomics database and portal facilitates georeferenced data integration and metadata-based comparisons of sampling sites as well as interactive data visualization.

Functional genomics offers the possibility to discover the molecular mechanisms underlying productive traits in farmed fish, and a step towards the application of marker assisted selection methods in this species. To this end, we report here on the development of an oligo DNA microarray for D. labrax.Results: A database consisting of 19,048 unique transcripts was constructed, of which 12,008 (63%) could be annotated by similarity and 4,692 received a GO functional annotation. Two non-overlapping 60mer probes were designed for each unique transcript and in-situ synthesized on glass slides using Agilent SurePrint™ technology. Probe design was positively completed for 19,035 target clusters; the oligo microarray was then applied to profile gene expression in mandibles and whole-heads of fish affected by prognathism, a skeletal malformation that strongly affects sea bass production. Statistical analysis identified 242 transcripts that are significantly down-regulated in deformed individuals compared to normal fish, with a significant enrichment in genes related to nervous system development and functioning. A set of genes spanning a wide dynamic range in gene expression level were selected for quantitative RT-PCR validation. Fold change correlation between microarray and qPCR data was always significant.Conclusions: The microarray platform developed for the European sea bass has a high level of flexibility, reliability, and reproducibility. Despite the well known limitations in achieving a proper functional annotation in non-model species, sufficient information was obtained to identify biological processes that are significantly enriched among differentially expressed genes. New insights were obtained on putative mechanisms involved on mandibular prognathism, suggesting that bone/nervous system development might play a role in this phenomenon. © 2010 Ferraresso et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"article; controlled study; correlation analysis; DNA microarray; down regulation; European sea bass; gene expression; gene expression profiling; genetic database; genetic transcription; jaw malformation; molecular probe; nervous system development; nervous system function; nonhuman; prognathia; reliability; reproducibility; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sequence homology; statistical analysis; animal; bass; congenital malformation; genetics; head; jaw malformation; methodology; quality control; Dicentrarchus labrax; Serranidae; complementary RNA; messenger RNA; Animals; Bass; Databases, Genetic; Gene Expression Profiling; Head; Jaw Abnormalities; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Quality Control; Reproducibility of Results; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Antisense; RNA, Messenger",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Here, we present the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of C. japonica, determined by the long-polymerase chain reaction and primer walking sequencing method. The entire genome is 15,738 bp in length, encoding a standard set of 13 protein-coding genes, two ribosomal RNA genes, and 22 transfer RNA genes, plus the putative control region, which is typical for metazoans. The total A+T content of the genome is 69.2%, lower than the other brachyuran crabs except for Callinectes sapidus. The gene order is identical to the published marine brachyurans and differs from the ancestral pancrustacean order by only the position of the tRNA His gene. Phylogenetic analyses using the concatenated nucleotide and amino acid sequences of 13 protein-coding genes strongly support the monophyly of Dendrobranchiata and Pleocyemata, which is consistent with the previous taxonomic classification. However, the systematic status of Charybdis within subfamily Thalamitinae of family Portunidae is not supported.

The recent genome availability for two species of Ostreococcus and Micromonas has led to the emergence of picophytoplankton comparative genomics. Sequencing has revealed many unexpected features about genome structure and led to several hypotheses on Ostreococcus biology and physiology. Despite the accumulation of genomic data, little is known about gene expression in eukaryotic picophytoplankton.Results: We have conducted a genome-wide analysis of gene expression in Ostreococcus tauri cells exposed to light/dark cycles (L/D). A Bayesian Fourier Clustering method was implemented to cluster rhythmic genes according to their expression waveform. In a single L/D condition nearly all expressed genes displayed rhythmic patterns of expression. Clusters of genes were associated with the main biological processes such as transcription in the nucleus and the organelles, photosynthesis, DNA replication and mitosis.Conclusions: Light/Dark time-dependent transcription of the genes involved in the main steps leading to protein synthesis (transcription basic machinery, ribosome biogenesis, translation and aminoacid synthesis) was observed, to an unprecedented extent in eukaryotes, suggesting a major input of transcriptional regulations in Ostreococcus. We propose that the diurnal co-regulation of genes involved in photoprotection, defence against oxidative stress and DNA repair might be an efficient mechanism, which protects cells against photo-damage thereby, contributing to the ability of O. tauri to grow under a wide range of light intensities. © 2010 Monnier et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase; algal DNA; algal RNA; transcription factor; amino acid synthesis; article; biogenesis; controlled study; DNA repair; DNA replication; gene expression; gene structure; genetic analysis; genetic association; karyotype; light dark cycle; lipid metabolism; mitosis; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; Ostreococcus; Ostreococcus tauri; oxidative stress; photosynthesis; protein synthesis; quantitative analysis; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; ribosome; RNA processing; RNA synthesis; transcription regulation; waveform; analysis of variance; Bayes theorem; biosynthesis; cluster analysis; DNA microarray; DNA sequence; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetic transcription; genetics; green alga; metabolism; photoperiodicity; principal component analysis; Eukaryota; Ostreococcus; Ostreococcus tauri; Algae, Green; Analysis of Variance; Bayes Theorem; Cluster Analysis; DNA Repair; DNA, Algal; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Lipid Metabolism; Mitosis; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Oxidative Stress; Photoperiod; Photosynthesis; Principal Component Analysis; RNA, Algal; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Transcription Factors; Transcription, Genetic",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Small larval size, and difficulties in acceptance of inert microdiets, makes progress slow and cumbersome. This lack of knowledge in fish larval nutritional requirements is one of the causes of high mortalities and quality problems commonly observed in marine larviculture. In recent years, several novel methodologies have contributed to significant progress in fish larval nutrition. Others are emerging and are likely to bring further insight into larval nutritional physiology and requirements. This paper reviews a range of new tools and some examples of their present use, as well as potential future applications in the study of fish larvae nutrition. Tube-feeding and incorporation into Artemia of 14C-amino acids and lipids allowed studying Artemia intake, digestion and absorption and utilisation of these nutrients. Diet selection by fish larvae has been studied with diets containing different natural stable isotope signatures or diets where different rare metal oxides were added. Mechanistic modelling has been used as a tool to integrate existing knowledge and reveal gaps, and also to better understand results obtained in tracer studies. Population genomics may assist in assessing genotype effects on nutritional requirements, by using progeny testing in fish reared in the same tanks, and also in identifying QTLs for larval stages. Functional genomics and proteomics enable the study of gene and protein expression under various dietary conditions, and thereby identify the metabolic pathways which are affected by a given nutrient. Promising results were obtained using the metabolic programming concept in early life to facilitate utilisation of certain nutrients at later stages. All together, these methodologies have made decisive contributions, and are expected to do even more in the near future, to build a knowledge basis for development of optimised diets and feeding regimes for different species of larval fish. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Fish larvae nutrition; Genomics; Metabolic programming; Modelling; Proteomics; Tracer studies","animal; animal disease; animal food; article; biological model; diet; fish; food intake; larva; metabolism; metagenomics; nutritional science; physiology; protein intake; proteomics; Animal Feed; Animal Nutrition Sciences; Animals; Diet; Dietary Proteins; Feeding Methods; Fishes; Larva; Metagenomics; Models, Biological; Proteomics; Artemia",Article,"",Scopus

Porcelain crabs, genus Petrolisthes, have been powerful crustacean models for environmental and evolutionary physiology with respect to thermal adaptation and understanding responses of marine organisms to climate change. Here, we present a large-scale EST sequencing and cDNA microarray database project for the porcelain crab Petrolisthes cinctipes. Methodology/Principal Findings:A set of ∼30K unique sequences (UniSeqs) representing ∼19K clusters were generated from ∼98K high quality ESTs from a set of tissue specific non-normalized and mixed-tissue normalized cDNA libraries from the porcelain crab Petrolisthes cinctipes. Homology for each UniSeq was assessed using BLAST, InterProScan, GO and KEGG database searches. Approximately 66% of the UniSeqs had homology in at least one of the databases. All EST and UniSeq sequences along with annotation results and coordinated cDNA microarray datasets have been made publicly accessible at the Porcelain Crab Array Database (PCAD), a feature-enriched version of the Stanford and Longhorn Array Databases. Conclusions/Significance:The EST project presented here represents the third largest sequencing effort for any crustacean, and the largest effort for any crab species. Our assembly and clustering results suggest that our porcelain crab EST data set is equally diverse to the much larger EST set generated in the Daphnia pulex genome sequencing project, and thus will be an important resource to the Daphnia research community. Our homology results support the pancrustacea hypothesis and suggest that Malacostraca may be ancestral to Branchiopoda and Hexapoda. Our results also suggest that our cDNA microarrays cover as much of the transcriptome as can reasonably be captured in EST library sequencing approaches, and thus represent a rich resource for studies of environmental genomics. © 2010 Tagmount et al.",,"complementary DNA; transcriptome; article; crab; Crustacea; Daphnia; DNA library; genome; hypothesis; metagenomics; microarray analysis; nonhuman; Petrolisthes cinctipes; sequence database; sequence homology; single nucleotide polymorphism; species; tissue specificity; animal; biology; chemistry; cluster analysis; Decapoda (Crustacea); DNA microarray; DNA sequence; expressed sequence tag; gene expression profiling; gene library; genetic database; genetics; methodology; molecular genetics; statistics; Branchiopoda; Crustacea; Daphnia; Daphnia pulex; Decapoda (Crustacea); Hexapoda; Malacostraca; Pancrustacea; Petrolisthes; Petrolisthes cinctipes; Porcellanidae; Animals; Cluster Analysis; Computational Biology; Databases, Genetic; Decapoda (Crustacea); DNA, Complementary; Expressed Sequence Tags; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Library; Molecular Sequence Data; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Sequence Analysis, DNA",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

As such, they have a significant impact on local and global ecosystem function and human health. Despite their importance, little is known about the genomic diversity harbored in phages, as methods to capture complete phage genomes have been hampered by the lack of knowledge about the target genomes, and difficulties in generating sufficient quantities of genomic DNA for sequencing. Of the approximately 550 phage genomes currently available in the public domain, fewer than 5% are marine phage. Methodology/Principal Findings: To advance the study of phage biology through comparative genomic approaches we used marine cyanophage as a model system. We compared DNA preparation methodologies (DNA extraction directly from either phage lysates or CsCl purified phage particles), and sequencing strategies that utilize either Sanger sequencing of a linker amplification shotgun library (LASL) or of a whole genome shotgun library (WGSL), or 454 pyrosequencing methods. We demonstrate that genomic DNA sample preparation directly from a phage lysate, combined with 454 pyrosequencing, is best suited for phage genome sequencing at scale, as this method is capable of capturing complete continuous genomes with high accuracy. In addition, we describe an automated annotation informatics pipeline that delivers high-quality annotation and yields few false positives and negatives in ORF calling.

Their diverse species composition and singular ecological niches provide at the same time challenges and rewards when studying the broad range of responses that make up their immune mechanisms. Two types of responses comprise the immune system of echinoderms: a cellular response and a humoral one. Cell-based immunity is carried by the celomocytes, a morphologically heterogeneous population of free roaming cells that are capable of recognizing and neutralizing pathogens. Celomocytes present diverse morphologies and functions, which include phagocytosis, encapsulation, clotting, cytotoxicity, wound healing among others. Humoral immunity is mediated by a wide variety of secreted compounds that can be found in the celomic fluid and play important roles in defense against infection. Compounds such as lectins, agglutinins, perforins, complement and some cytokines make up some of the humoral responses of echinoderms. Recent advances in the field of molecular biology, genomics and transcriptomics have allowed for the discovery of new immune genes and their products.

Based on 16S rRNA phylogeny, initial assignment of these archaea was to the Crenarchaeota. By contrast, features of the first genome sequence from a member of this group suggested that they belong to a novel phylum, the Thaumarchaeota. Here, we re-investigate the Thaumarchaeota hypothesis by including two newly available genomes, that of the marine ammonia oxidizer Nitrosopumilus maritimus and that of Nitrososphaera gargensis, a representative of another evolutionary lineage within this group predominantly detected in terrestrial environments. Phylogenetic studies based on r-proteins and other core genes, as well as comparative genomics, confirm the assignment of these organisms to a separate phylum and reveal a Thaumarchaeota-specific set of core informational processing genes, as well as potentially ancestral features of the archaea. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",,"ammonia; bacterial protein; ribosome protein; archaeal protein; archaeal RNA; DNA binding protein; DNA directed RNA polymerase; DNA topoisomerase; RNA 16S; archaebacterium; article; bacterial gene; bacterial genome; bacterial metabolism; bacterium identification; controlled study; genetic variability; marine bacterium; molecular evolution; nitrosopumilus maritimus; Nitrososphaera gargensis; Nitrosospira; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; phylum; priority journal; species comparison; terrestrial species; Thaumarchaeota; archaeal genome; archaeon; cell division; chemistry; classification; Crenarchaeota; DNA sequence; Euryarchaeota; genetics; metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction; Archaea; Candidatus Nitrosopumilus maritimus; Crenarchaeota; Ammonia; Archaea; Archaeal Proteins; Cell Division; Conserved Sequence; Crenarchaeota; DNA Topoisomerases, Type I; DNA-Binding Proteins; DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases; Euryarchaeota; Genome, Archaeal; Oxidation-Reduction; Phylogeny; Ribosomal Proteins; RNA, Archaeal; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, DNA",Article,"",Scopus

Metagenomic projects, such as the Global Ocean Sampling expedition (GOS), have demonstrated the predominance of tailed phages (Caudovirales), particularly T4 superfamily cyanophages (Cyano-T4s), in the marine milieu. Whereas previous metagenomic analyses were limited to gene content information, here we present a comparative analysis of over 300 phage scaffolds assembled from the viral fraction of the GOS data. This assembly permits the examination of synteny (organization) of the genes on the scaffolds and their comparison with the genome sequences from cultured Cyano-T4s. We employ comparative genomics and a novel usage of network visualization software to show that the scaffold phylogenies are similar to those of the traditional marker genes they contain. Importantly, these uncultured metagenomic scaffolds quite closely match the organization of the ""core genome"" of the known Cyano-T4s. This indicates that the current view of genome architecture in the Cyano-T4s is not seriously biased by being based on a small number of cultured phages, and we can be confident that they accurately reflect the diverse population of such viruses in marine surface waters. © The Author 2010.

Nevertheless, life, especially microbial life, thrives throughout the marine biosphere and microbes have adapted to all the divergent environments present. Large scale DNA sequence based approaches have recently been used to investigate the marine environment and these studies have revealed that the oceans harbor unprecedented microbial diversity. Novel gene families with representatives only within such metagenomic datasets represent a large proportion of the ocean metagenome. The presence of so many new gene families from these uncultured and highly diverse microbial populations represents a challenge for the understanding of and exploitation of the biology and biochemistry of the ocean environment. The application of new metagenomic and single cell genomics tools offers new ways to explore the complete metabolic diversity of the marine biome. © 2010 by the authors; licensee Molecular Diversity Preservation International.","Enzyme; Marine; Metagenome; Microorganism","amidase; amylase; cellulase; chitinase; esterase; phytase; proteinase; triacylglycerol lipase; xylan endo 1,3 beta xylosidase; sea water; biotechnology; biotransformation; functional genomics; high throughput screening; marine bacterium; marine environment; metagenomics; microbial community; microbial diversity; microbial metabolism; molecular phylogeny; nonhuman; ocean environment; polymerase chain reaction; review; sea surface waters; sequence analysis; Bacteria; data mining; enzymology; genetics; marine biology; metabolism; microbiology; procedures; Bacteria; Biotechnology; Data Mining; Marine Biology; Metagenomics; Seawater; Water Microbiology",Review,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

To facilitate gene cloning and characterization, genome analysis, physical mapping, and molecular selection breeding of marine shrimp, we have developed the techniques to isolate high-quality megabase-sized DNA from hemocyte nuclear DNA of female shrimp and constructed a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) genomic library for the species. The library was constructed in the Hind III site of the vector pECBAC1, consisting of 101,760 clones arrayed in 265 384-well microtiter plates, with an average insert size of 101 kb, and covering the genome approximately fivefold. To characterize the library, 92,160 clones were spotted onto high-density nylon filters for hybridization screening. A set of 18 pairs of overgo probes designed from eight cDNA sequences of L. vannamei genes were used in hybridization screening, and 35 positive clones were identified. These results suggest that the shrimp BAC libraries will provide a useful resource for screening of genomic regions of interest candidate genes, gene families, or large-sized synthetic DNA region and promote future works on comparative genomics, physical mapping, and large-scale genome sequencing in the species. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library; Genome; Litopenaeus vannamei; Overgo probe; Pacific white shrimp","BAC library; Bacterial artificial chromosome libraries; Bacterial artificial chromosomes; Candidate genes; cDNA sequence; Comparative genomics; Gene cloning; Gene families; Genome; Genome analysis; Genome sequencing; Genomic libraries; Genomic regions; High quality; High-density; Insert size; Litopenaeus; Marine aquaculture; Marine shrimp; Megabase; Microtiter plates; Nuclear DNA; Nylon filters; Physical mapping; Synthetic DNA; Agriculture; Aquaculture; Bacteriology; Cloning; DNA; Probes; Genes; DNA; primer DNA; chromosome; clone; crustacean; future prospect; genetic analysis; genome; hybridization; animal; article; bacterial artificial chromosome; China; DNA probe; female; gene library; genetics; genomics; isolation and purification; Penaeidae; Animals; China; Chromosomes, Artificial, Bacterial; DNA; DNA Primers; DNA Probes; Female; Gene Library; Genomics; Penaeidae; Bacteria (microorganisms); Decapoda (Crustacea); Litopenaeus vannamei",Article,"",Scopus
