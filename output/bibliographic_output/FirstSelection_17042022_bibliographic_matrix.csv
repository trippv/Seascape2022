"Navigating the currents of seascape genomics: how spatial analyses can augment population genomic studies","10.1093/cz/zow067","Riginos, C; Crandall, ED; Liggins, L; Bongaerts, P; Treml, EA","Population genomic approaches are making rapid inroads in the study of non-model organisms, including marine taxa. To date, these marine studies have predominantly focused on rudimentary metrics describing the spatial and environmental context of their study region (e.g., geographical distance, average sea surface temperature, average salinity). We contend that a more nuanced and considered approach to quantifying seascape dynamics and patterns can strengthen population genomic investigations and help identify spatial, temporal, and environmental factors associated with differing selective regimes or demographic histories. Nevertheless, approaches for quantifying marine landscapes are complicated. Characteristic features of the marine environment, including pelagic living in flowing water (experienced by most marine taxa at some point in their life cycle), require a well-designed spatial-temporal sampling strategy and analysis. Many genetic summary statistics used to describe populations may be inappropriate for marine species with large population sizes, large species ranges, stochastic recruitment, and asymmetrical gene flow. Finally, statistical approaches for testing associations between seascapes and population genomic patterns are still maturing with no single approach able to capture all relevant considerations. None of these issues are completely unique to marine systems and therefore similar issues and solutions will be shared for many organisms regardless of habitat. Here, we outline goals and spatial approaches for landscape genomics with an emphasis on marine systems and review the growing empirical literature on seascape genomics. We review established tools and approaches and highlight promising new strategies to overcome select issues including a strategy to spatially optimize sampling. Despite the many challenges, we argue that marine systems may be especially well suited for identifying candidate genomic regions under environmentally mediated selection and that seascape genomic approaches are especially useful for identifying robust locus-by-environment associations.",2016,"adaptation; genetic-environment association; landscape; oceanography; population genomics; remote sensing; seascape genetics","Article","ISI"
"Multi-model seascape genomics identifies distinct environmental drivers of selection among sympatric marine species","10.1186/s12862-020-01679-4","Nielsen, ES; Henriques, R; Beger, M; Toonen, RJ; von der Heyden, S","Background As global change and anthropogenic pressures continue to increase, conservation and management increasingly needs to consider species' potential to adapt to novel environmental conditions. Therefore, it is imperative to characterise the main selective forces acting on ecosystems, and how these may influence the evolutionary potential of populations and species. Using a multi-model seascape genomics approach, we compare putative environmental drivers of selection in three sympatric southern African marine invertebrates with contrasting ecology and life histories: Cape urchin (Parechinus angulosus), Common shore crab (Cyclograpsus punctatus), and Granular limpet (Scutellastra granularis). Results Using pooled (Pool-seq), restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq), and seven outlier detection methods, we characterise genomic variation between populations along a strong biogeographical gradient. Of the three species, onlyS. granularisshowed significant isolation-by-distance, and isolation-by-environment driven by sea surface temperatures (SST). In contrast, sea surface salinity (SSS) and range in air temperature correlated more strongly with genomic variation inC. punctatusandP. angulosus. Differences were also found in genomic structuring between the three species, with outlier loci contributing to two clusters in the East and West Coasts forS. granularisandP. angulosus, but not forC. punctatus. Conclusion The findings illustrate distinct evolutionary potential across species, suggesting that species-specific habitat requirements and responses to environmental stresses may be better predictors of evolutionary patterns than the strong environmental gradients within the region. We also found large discrepancies between outlier detection methodologies, and thus offer a novel multi-model approach to identifying the principal environmental selection forces acting on species. Overall, this work highlights how adding a comparative approach to seascape genomics (both with multiple models and species) can elucidate the intricate evolutionary responses of ecosystems to global change.",2020,"pool-seq; rad-seq; seascape genomics; environmental association; comparative phylogeography; marine invertebrates","Article","ISI"
"Seascape genomics of eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) along the Atlantic coast of Canada","10.1111/eva.12741","Bernatchez, S; Xuereb, A; Laporte, M; Benestan, L; Steeves, R; Laflamme, M; Bernatchez, L; Mallet, MA","Interactions between environmental factors and complex life-history characteristics of marine organisms produce the genetic diversity and structure observed within species. Our main goal was to test for genetic differentiation among eastern oyster populations from the coastal region of Canadian Maritimes against expected genetic homogeneity caused by historical events, taking into account spatial and environmental (temperature, salinity, turbidity) variation. This was achieved by genotyping 486 individuals originating from 13 locations using RADSeq. A total of 11,321 filtered SNPs were used in a combination of population genomics and environmental association analyses. We revealed significant neutral genetic differentiation (mean F-ST = 0.009) between sampling locations, and the occurrence of six major genetic clusters within the studied system. Redundancy analyses (RDAs) revealed that spatial and environmental variables explained 3.1% and 4.9% of the neutral genetic variation and 38.6% and 12.2% of the putatively adaptive genetic variation, respectively. These results indicate that these environmental factors play a role in the distribution of both neutral and putatively adaptive genetic diversity in the system. Moreover, polygenic selection was suggested by genotype-environment association analysis and significant correlations between additive polygenic scores and temperature and salinity. We discuss our results in the context of their conservation and management implications for the eastern oyster.",2019,"aquaculture; genomics; genotype by sequencing; oyster; population genetics; radseq","Article","ISI"
"Seascape genomics reveals adaptive divergence in a connected and commercially important mollusc, the greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata), along a longitudinal environmental gradient","10.1111/mec.14526","Sandoval-Castillo, J; Robinson, NA; Hart, AM; Strain, LWS; Beheregaray, LB","Populations of broadcast spawning marine organisms often have large sizes and are exposed to reduced genetic drift. Under such scenarios, strong selection associated with spatial environmental heterogeneity is expected to drive localized adaptive divergence, even in the face of connectivity. We tested this hypothesis using a seascape genomics approach in the commercially important greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata). We assessed how its population structure has been influenced by environmental heterogeneity along a zonal coastal boundary in southern Australia linked by strong oceanographic connectivity. Our data sets include 9,109 filtered SNPs for 371 abalones from 13 localities and environmental mapping across similar to 800 km. Genotype-environment association analyses and outlier tests defined 8,786 putatively neutral and 323 candidate adaptive loci. From a neutral perspective, the species is better represented by a metapopulation with very low differentiation (global F-ST = 0.0081) and weak isolation by distance following a stepping-stone model. For the candidate adaptive loci, however, model-based and model-free approaches indicated five divergent population clusters. After controlling for spatial distance, the distribution of putatively adaptive variation was strongly correlated to selection linked to minimum sea surface temperature and oxygen concentration. Around 80 candidates were annotated to genes with functions related to high temperature and/or low oxygen tolerance, including genes that influence the resilience of abalone species found in other biogeographic regions. Our study includes a documented example about the uptake of genomic information in fisheries management and supports the hypothesis of adaptive divergence due to coastal environmental heterogeneity in a connected metapopulation of a broadcast spawner.",2018,"climate change; ddrad-seq; ecological genomics; landscape genomics; marine protected areas (mpas); population connectivity; southern australia","Article","ISI"

Driven by the recent climatic changes, rapid northward shifts of species' distribution ranges can potentially modify the phylogeographic signature of Last Glacial Maximum. We explored this question in detail in the cold-tolerant kelp species Saccharina latissima, using microsatellites and double digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing ( ddRAD-seq) derived single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to analyze the genetic diversity and structure in 11 sites spanning the entire European Atlantic latitudinal range of this species. In addition, we checked for statistical correlation between genetic marker allele frequencies and three environmental proxies (sea surface temperature, salinity, and water turbidity). Our findings revealed that genetic diversity was significantly higher for the northernmost locality (Spitsbergen) compared to the southern ones (Northern Iberia), which we discuss in light of the current state of knowledge on phylogeography of S. latissima and the potential influence of the recent climatic changes on the population structure of this species. Seven SNPs and 12 microsatellite alleles were found to be significantly associated with at least one of the three environmental variables. We speculate on the putative adaptive functions of the genes associated with the outlier markers and the importance of these markers for successful conservation and aquaculture strategies for S. latissima in this age of rapid global change.",2020,"local adaptation; genetic diversity; outlier loci; environmental variables; phylogeography; snps and microsatellites","Article","ISI"
"Seascape genomics reveals candidate molecular targets of heat stress adaptation in three coral species","10.1111/mec.15857","Selmoni, O; Lecellier, G; Magalon, H; Vigliola, L; Oury, N; Benzoni, F; Peignon, C; Joost, S; Berteaux-Lecellier, V","Anomalous heat waves are causing a major decline of hard corals around the world and threatening the persistence of coral reefs. There are, however, reefs that have been exposed to recurrent thermal stress over the years and whose corals appear to have been tolerant against heat. One of the mechanisms that could explain this phenomenon is local adaptation, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly known. In this work, we applied a seascape genomics approach to study heat stress adaptation in three coral species of New Caledonia (southwestern Pacific) and to uncover the molecular actors potentially involved. We used remote sensing data to characterize the environmental trends across the reef system, and sampled corals living at the most contrasted sites. These samples underwent next generation sequencing to reveal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), frequencies of which were associated with heat stress gradients. As these SNPs might underpin an adaptive role, we characterized the functional roles of the genes located in their genomic region. In each of the studied species, we found heat stress-associated SNPs located in proximity of genes involved in pathways well known to contribute to the cellular responses against heat, such as protein folding, oxidative stress homeostasis, inflammatory and apoptotic pathways, and DNA damage-repair. In some cases, the same candidate molecular targets of heat stress adaptation recurred among species. Together, these results underline the relevance and the power of the seascape genomics approach for the discovery of adaptive traits that could allow corals to persist across wider thermal ranges.",2021,"coral bleaching; coral reef; heat stress; local adaptation; seascape genomics","Article","ISI"
"Functional genomics to assess biological responses to marine pollution at physiological and evolutionary timescales: toward a vision of predictive ecotoxicology","10.1093/bfgp/elv060","Reid, NM; Whitehead, A","Marine pollution is ubiquitous, and is one of the key factors influencing contemporary marine biodiversity worldwide. To protect marine biodiversity, how do we surveil, document and predict the short- and long-term impacts of pollutants on at-risk species? Modern genomics tools offer high-throughput, information-rich and increasingly cost-effective approaches for characterizing biological responses to environmental stress, and are important tools within an increasing sophisticated kit for surveiling and assessing impacts of pollutants on marine species. Through the lens of recent research in marine killifish, we illustrate how genomics tools may be useful for screening chemicals and pollutants for biological activity and to reveal specific mechanisms of action. The high dimensionality of transcriptomic responses enables their usage as highly specific fingerprints of exposure, and these fingerprints can be used to diagnose environmental problems. We also emphasize that molecular pathways recruited to respond at physiological timescales are the same pathways that may be targets for natural selection during chronic exposure to pollutants. Gene complement and sequence variation in those pathways can be related to variation in sensitivity to environmental pollutants within and among species. Furthermore, allelic variation associated with evolved tolerance in those pathways could be tracked to estimate the pace of environmental health decline and recovery. We finish by integrating these paradigms into a vision of how genomics approaches could anchor a modernized framework for advancing the predictive capacity of environmental and ecotoxicological science.",2016,"evolutionary toxicology; genomics; transcriptomics; predictive toxicology; ecotoxicogenomics; adaptation","Article","ISI"

In light of this, it is important to understand neutral gene flow patterns as a measure of dispersal potential, but also adaptive genetic variation as a measure of evolutionary potential. In order to assess genetic variation and how this relates to environment in the honeycomb worm (Sabellaria alveolata(L.)), a reef-building polychaete that supports high biodiversity, we carried out RAD sequencing using individuals from along its complete latitudinal range. Patterns of neutral population genetic structure were compared to larval dispersal as predicted by ocean circulation modelling, and outlier analyses and genotype-environment association tests were used to attempt to identify loci under selection in relation to local temperature data. Results We genotyped 482 filtered SNPs, from 68 individuals across nine sites, 27 of which were identified as outliers using BAYESCAN and ARLEQUIN. All outlier loci were potentially under balancing selection, despite previous evidence of local adaptation in the system. Limited gene flow was observed among reef-sites (F-ST = 0.28 +/- 0.10), in line with the low dispersal potential identified by the larval dispersal models. The North Atlantic reef emerged as a distinct population and this was linked to high local larval retention and the effect of the North Atlantic Current on dispersal. Conclusions As an isolated population, with limited potential for natural genetic or demographic augmentation from other reefs, the North Atlantic site warrants conservation attention in order to preserve not only this species, but above all the crucial functional ecological roles that are associated with their bioconstructions. Our study highlights the utility of using seascape genomics to identify populations of conservation concern.",2020,"radseq; ocean circulation modelling; adaptation; marine invertebrate; larval dispersal","Article","ISI"

However, little is known about the characteristics that are linked to marine adaptation in marine-derived streptomycetes. The particularity and complexity of the marine environment suggest that marine streptomycetes are genetically diverse. Here, we sequenced nine strains from the Streptomyces genus that were isolated from different longitudes, latitudes, and depths of the South China Sea. Then we compared these strains to 22 NCBI downloaded streptomycete strains. Thirty-one streptomycete strains are clearly grouped into a marine-derived subgroup and multiple source subgroup-based phylogenetic tree. The phylogenetic analyses have revealed the dynamic process underlying streptomycete genome evolution, and lateral gene transfer is an important driving force during the process. Pan-genomics analyses have revealed that streptomycetes have an open pan-genome, which reflects the diversity of these streptomycetes and guarantees the species a quick and economical response to diverse environments. Functional and comparative genomics analyses indicate that the marine-derived streptomycetes subgroup possesses some common characteristics of marine adaptation. Our findings have expanded our knowledge of how ocean isolates of streptomycete strains adapt to marine environments. The availability of streptomycete genomes from the South China Sea will be beneficial for further analysis on marine streptomycetes and will enrich the South China Sea's genetic data sources.",2016,"comparative genomics; streptomycete; pan-genomics; genome dynamics; marine environment adaptation","Article","ISI"
"Seascape Genomics Reveals Metapopulation Connectivity Network of Paramuricea biscaya in the Northern Gulf of Mexico","10.3389/fmars.2021.790929","Galaska, MP; Liu, GP; West, D; Erickson, K; Quattrini, AM; Bracco, A; Herrera, S","The degree of connectivity among populations influences their ability to respond to natural and anthropogenic stressors. In marine systems, determining the scale, rate, and directionality of larval dispersal is therefore, central to understanding how coral metapopulations are interconnected and the degree of resiliency in the event of a localized disturbance. Understanding these source-sink dynamics is essential to guide restoration efforts and for the study of ecology and evolution in the ocean. The patterns and mechanisms of connectivity in the deep-sea (>200 m deep) are largely understudied. In this study, we investigated the spatial diversity patterns and metapopulation connectivity of the octocoral Paramuricea biscaya throughout the northern Gulf of Mexico (GoM). Paramuricea biscaya is one of the most abundant corals on the lower continental slope (between 1,200 and 2,500 m) in the GoM. The 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill (DWH) directly impacted populations of this species and thus are considered primary targets for restoration. We used a combination of seascape genomic analyses, high-resolution ocean circulation modeling, and larval dispersal simulations to quantify the degree of population structuring and connectivity among P. biscaya populations. Evidence supports the hypotheses that the genetic diversity of P. biscaya is structured by depth, and that larval dispersal among connected populations is asymmetric due to dominant ocean circulation patterns. Our results suggest that there are intermediate unsampled populations in the central GoM that serve as stepping stones for dispersal. The data suggest that the DeSoto Canyon area, and possibly the West Florida Escarpment, critically act as sources of larvae for areas impacted by the DWH oil spill in the Mississippi Canyon. This work illustrates that the management of deep-sea marine protected areas should incorporate knowledge of connectivity networks and depth-dependent processes throughout the water column.",2021,"population genomics; connectivity; gulf of mexico; coral; seascape genomics; radseq; dispersal; deep-sea","Article","ISI"

The viability of remnant populations remains uncertain and could be impacted by continued fishing and by-catch pressure, and the projected impacts of climate change. We genotyped 503 samples of D. batis, obtained opportunistically from the widest available geographic range, across 6 350 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using a reduced-representation sequencing approach. Genotypes were used to assess the species' contemporary population structure, estimate effective population sizes and identify putative signals of selection in relation to environmental variables using a seascape genomics approach. We identified genetic discontinuities between inshore (British Isles) and offshore (Rockall and Faroe Island) populations, with differentiation most pronounced across the deep waters of the Rockall Trough. Effective population sizes were largest in the Celtic Sea and Rockall, but low enough to be of potential conservation concern among Scottish and Faroese sites. Among the 21 candidate SNPs under positive selection was one significantly correlated with environmental variables predicted to be affected by climate change, including bottom temperature, salinity and pH. The paucity of well-annotated elasmobranch genomes precluded us from identifying a putative function for this SNP. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that climate change could inflict a strong selective force upon remnant populations of D. batis, further constraining its already-restricted habitat. Furthermore, the results provide fundamental insights on the distribution, behaviour and evolutionary biology of D. batis in the North-East Atlantic that will be useful for the establishment of conservation actions for this and other critically endangered elasmobranchs.",2022,"blue skate; climate change; conservation; dipturus batis; population genomics; seascape genomics","Article","ISI"

In this study, we assessed the relative importance of spatial distribution, ocean currents and sea surface temperature (SST) on patterns of putatively neutral and adaptive genetic variation among American lobster from 19 locations using population differentiation (PD) approaches combined with environmental association (EA) analyses. First, PD approaches (using BAYESCAN, ARLEQUIN and OUTFLANK) found 28 outlier SNPs putatively under divergent selection and 9770 neutral SNPs in common. Redundancy analysis revealed that spatial distribution, ocean current-mediated larval connectivity and SST explained 31.7% of the neutral genetic differentiation, with ocean currents driving the majority of this relationship (21.0%). After removing the influence of spatial distribution, no SST were significant for putatively neutral genetic variation whereas minimum annual SST still had a significant impact and explained 8.1% of the putatively adaptive genetic variation. Second, EA analyses (using Pearson correlation tests, BAYESCENV and LFMM) jointly identified seven SNPs as candidates for thermal adaptation. Covariation at these SNPs was assessed with a spatial multivariate analysis that highlighted a significant temperature association, after accounting for the influence of spatial distribution. Among the 505 candidate SNPs detected by at least one of the three approaches, we discovered three polymorphisms located in genes previously shown to play a role in thermal adaptation.

This is mediated by life-history traits such as the timing and frequency of spawning, larval behaviour and duration, and settlement success.

Hydrodynamic modelling employing the NEMO Atlantic Margin Model (AMM15) was used to simulate larval transport and estimate connectivity between populations during spawning months (April-September), factoring in larval duration and interannual variability of ocean currents. Results at neutral loci reveal the existence of three separate genetic clusters (mean F-ST = 0.021) within a relatively fine spatial scale in the north-west Atlantic. Environmental association analysis indicates that oceanographic currents and geographic proximity explain over 20% of the variance observed at neutral loci, while genetic variance (71%) at outlier loci was explained by sea surface temperature extremes.

"Speciation in marine environments: Diving under the surface","10.1111/jeb.13756","Faria, R; Johannesson, K; Stankowski, S","Marine environments are inhabited by a broad representation of the tree of life, yet our understanding of speciation in marine ecosystems is extremely limited compared with terrestrial and freshwater environments. Developing a more comprehensive picture of speciation in marine environments requires that we 'dive under the surface' by studying a wider range of taxa and ecosystems is necessary for a more comprehensive picture of speciation. Although studying marine evolutionary processes is often challenging, recent technological advances in different fields, from maritime engineering to genomics, are making it increasingly possible to study speciation of marine life forms across diverse ecosystems and taxa. Motivated by recent research in the field, including the 14 contributions in this issue, we highlight and discuss six axes of research that we think will deepen our understanding of speciation in the marine realm: (a) study a broader range of marine environments and organisms; (b) identify the reproductive barriers driving speciation between marine taxa; (c) understand the role of different genomic architectures underlying reproductive isolation; (d) infer the evolutionary history of divergence using model-based approaches; (e) study patterns of hybridization and introgression between marine taxa; and (f) implement highly interdisciplinary, collaborative research programmes.

"Comparative genomic insights into the taxonomy of Edwardsiella tarda isolated from different hosts: Marine, freshwater and migratory fish","10.1111/are.13448","Shao, JC; Guo, QX; Hu, RX; Gu, ZM","Edwardsiella tarda, a Gram-negative member of the family Enterobacteriaceae, has been isolated from many animal species worldwide, especially fish species. Its broad host range indicates the diversity in taxonomy, which attracted the attention of many researchers. Here, we added genome of E.tarda strain isolated from freshwater fish to comparative genomics study for the first time. We sequenced and assembled the genome of E.tarda ASE201307 which was isolated from freshwater Asian swamp eel. ASE201307 genome contained a single circular chromosome of 3.68M with G+C 57.09% content. Comparative genomics including SNP calling, synteny block, Core/Pan genes analysis and phylogeny analysis was conducted among ASE201307 and other Edwardsiella strains isolated from different fish species. Results of SNP analysis and synteny block demonstrated the close relative of ASE201307, FL95.01 and DT which were all isolated from freshwater fish. In further analysis heat map of dispensable genes and phylogenetic tree, all E.tarda strains were divided into two groups. One was isolated from freshwater fish and the other was isolated from marine/migratory fish. Based on all studies above, we proposed the living environment of hosts as a new taxonomic character and divided E.tarda isolated from diseased fish into freshwater group and marine/migratory group.",2018,"comparative genomic; edwardsiella tarda; genome; taxonomy","Article","ISI"
"Diverse Horizontally-Acquired Gene Clusters Confer Sucrose Utilization to Different Lineages of the Marine Pathogen Photobacterium damselae subsp. damselae","10.3390/genes11111244","Abushattal, S; Vences, A; Barca, AV; Osorio, CR","The ability to metabolize sucrose is a variable trait within the family Vibrionaceae. The marine bacterium Photobacterium damselae subsp. damselae (Pdd), pathogenic for marine animals and humans, is generally described as negative for sucrose utilization (Scr(-)). Previous studies have reported sucrose-utilizing isolates (Scr(+)), but the genetic basis of this variable phenotype remains uncharacterized. Here, we carried out the genome sequencing of five Scr(+) and two Scr(-) Pdd isolates and conducted a comparative genomics analysis with sixteen additional Pdd genomes sequenced in previous studies. We identified two different versions of a four-gene cluster (scr cluster) exclusive of Scr(+) isolates encoding a PTS system sucrose-specific IIBC component (scrA), a fructokinase (scrK), a sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase (scrB), and a sucrose operon repressor (scrR). A scrA deletion mutant did not ferment sucrose and was impaired for growth with sucrose as carbon source. Comparative genomics analyses suggested that scr clusters were acquired by horizontal transfer by different lineages of Pdd and were inserted into a recombination hot-spot in the Pdd genome. The incongruence of phylogenies based on housekeeping genes and on scr genes revealed that phylogenetically diverse gene clusters for sucrose utilization have undergone extensive horizontal transfer among species of Vibrio and Photobacterium.",2020,"sucrose; photobacterium damselae; vibrio; vibrio damsela; tcbs; pts; horizontal gene transfer","Article","ISI"
"Ocean acidification and marine microorganisms: responses and consequences","10.1016/j.oceano.2015.07.003","Das, S; Mangwani, N","Ocean acidification (OA) is one of the global issues caused by rising atmospheric CO2. The rising pCO(2) and resulting pH decrease has altered ocean carbonate chemistry. Microbes are key components of marine environments involved in nutrient cycles and carbon flow in marine ecosystems. However, these marine microbes and the microbial processes are sensitive to ocean pH shift. Thus, OA affects the microbial diversity, primary productivity and trace gases emission in oceans. Apart from that, it can also manipulate the microbial activities such as quorum sensing, extracellular enzyme activity and nitrogen cycling. Short-term laboratory experiments, mesocosm studies and changing marine diversity scenarios have illustrated undesirable effects of OA on marine microorganisms and ecosystems. However, from the microbial perspective, the current understanding on effect of OA is based mainly on limited experimental studies. It is challenging to predict response of marine microbes based on such experiments for this complex process. To study the response of marine microbes towards OA, multiple approaches should be implemented by using functional genomics, new generation microscopy, small-scale interaction among organisms and/or between organic matter and organisms. This review focuses on the response of marine microorganisms to OA and the experimental approaches to investigate the effect of changing ocean carbonate chemistry on microbial mediated processes.

The extensive coast of Northwestern Australia provides an emerging frontier for implementing new genomic tools to comparatively identify patterns of dispersal across diverse and extreme environmental conditions. Here, we focused on the stripey snapper (Lutjanus carponotatus), which is important to recreational, charter-based and customary fishers throughout the Indo-West Pacific. We collected 1,016 L.carponotatus samples at 51 locations in the coastal waters of Northwestern Australia ranging from the Northern Territory to Shark Bay and adopted a genotype-by-sequencing approach to test whether realized connectivity (via larval dispersal) was related to extreme gradients in coastal hydrodynamics. Hydrodynamic simulations using CONNIE and a more detailed treatment in the Kimberley Bioregion provided null models for comparison. Based on 4,402 polymorphic single nucleotide polymorphism loci shared across all individuals, we demonstrated significant genetic subdivision between the Shark Bay Bioregion in the south and all locations within the remaining, more northern bioregions. More importantly, we identified a zone of admixture spanning a distance of 180km at the border of the Kimberley and Canning bioregions, including the Buccaneer Archipelago and adjacent waters, which collectively experiences the largest tropical tidal range and some of the fastest tidal currents in the world. Further testing of the generality of this admixture zone in other shallow water species across broader geographic ranges will be critical for our understanding of the population dynamics and genetic structure of marine taxa in our tropical oceans.",2017,"biodiversity; coral reef; dartseq; environmental gradients; kimberley; marine","Article","ISI"
"Seascape genomics as a new tool to empower coral reef conservation strategies: An example on north-western Pacific Acropora digitifera","10.1111/eva.12944","Selmoni, O; Rochat, E; Lecellier, G; Berteaux-Lecellier, V; Joost, S","Coral reefs are suffering a major decline due to the environmental constraints imposed by climate change. Over the last 20 years, three major coral bleaching events occurred in concomitance with anomalous heatwaves, provoking a severe loss of coral cover worldwide. The conservation strategies for preserving reefs, as they are implemented now, cannot cope with global climatic shifts. Consequently, researchers are advocating for preservation networks to be set-up to reinforce coral adaptive potential. However, the main obstacle to this implementation is that studies on coral adaption are usually hard to generalize at the scale of a reef system. Here, we study the relationships between genotype frequencies and environmental characteristics of the sea (seascape genomics), in combination with connectivity analysis, to investigate the adaptive potential of a flagship coral species of the Ryukyu Archipelago (Japan). By associating genotype frequencies with descriptors of historical environmental conditions, we discovered six genomic regions hosting polymorphisms that might promote resistance against heat stress. Remarkably, annotations of genes in these regions were consistent with molecular roles associated with heat responses. Furthermore, we combined information on genetic and spatial distances between reefs to predict connectivity at a regional scale. The combination of these results portrayed the adaptive potential of this population: we were able to identify reefs carrying potential heat stress adapted genotypes and to understand how they disperse to neighbouring reefs. This information was summarized by objective, quantifiable and mappable indices covering the whole region, which can be extremely useful for future prioritization of reefs in conservation planning. This framework is transferable to any coral species on any reef system and therefore represents a valuable tool for empowering preservation efforts dedicated to the protection of coral reefs in warming oceans.",2020,"acropora digitifera; climate change; conservation genomics; coral bleaching; coral reefs; local adaptation; ryukyu archipelago; seascape genomics","Article","ISI"

Using this reference genome, we performed chromosome evolution analysis of the sperm whale, including constructing ancestral chromosomes, identifying chromosome rearrangement events and comparing with cattle chromosomes, which provides a resource for exploring marine mammal adaptation and speciation. We detected a high proportion of long interspersed nuclear elements and expanded gene families, and contraction of major histocompatibility complex region genes which were specific to sperm whale. Using comparisons with sheep and cattle, we analysed positively selected genes to identify gene pathways that may be related to adaptation to the marine environment. Further, we identified possible convergent evolution in aquatic mammals by testing for positively selected genes across three orders of marine mammals.

Neutral mAPs catalyze the cleavage of neutral amino acids from the N-terminus of proteins or peptide substrates; they need one or two metallic cofactors in their active site. Information about marine invertebrate's neutral mAPs properties is scarce; available data are mainly derived from genomics and cDNA studies. The goal of this work was to characterize the biochemical properties of the neutral APs activities in eight Cuban marine invertebrate species from the Phyla Mollusca, Porifera, Echinodermata, and Cnidaria. Determination of substrate specificity, optimal pH and effects of inhibitors (1,10-phenanthroline, amastatin, and bestatin) and cobalt on activity led to the identification of distinct neutral AP-like activities, whose biochemical behaviors were similar to those of the M1 and M17 families of mAPs. Additionally, M18-like glutamyl AP activities were detected.

"Observing copepods through a genomic lens","10.1186/1742-9994-8-22","Bron, JE; Frisch, D; Goetze, E; Johnson, SC; Lee, CE; Wyngaard, GA","Background: Copepods outnumber every other multicellular animal group. They are critical components of the world's freshwater and marine ecosystems, sensitive indicators of local and global climate change, key ecosystem service providers, parasites and predators of economically important aquatic animals and potential vectors of waterborne disease. Copepods sustain the world fisheries that nourish and support human populations. Although genomic tools have transformed many areas of biological and biomedical research, their power to elucidate aspects of the biology, behavior and ecology of copepods has only recently begun to be exploited. Discussion: The extraordinary biological and ecological diversity of the subclass Copepoda provides both unique advantages for addressing key problems in aquatic systems and formidable challenges for developing a focused genomics strategy. This article provides an overview of genomic studies of copepods and discusses strategies for using genomics tools to address key questions at levels extending from individuals to ecosystems. Genomics can, for instance, help to decipher patterns of genome evolution such as those that occur during transitions from free living to symbiotic and parasitic lifestyles and can assist in the identification of genetic mechanisms and accompanying physiological changes associated with adaptation to new or physiologically challenging environments. The adaptive significance of the diversity in genome size and unique mechanisms of genome reorganization during development could similarly be explored. Genome-wide and EST studies of parasitic copepods of salmon and large EST studies of selected free-living copepods have demonstrated the potential utility of modern genomics approaches for the study of copepods and have generated resources such as EST libraries, shotgun genome sequences, BAC libraries, genome maps and inbred lines that will be invaluable in assisting further efforts to provide genomics tools for copepods. Summary: Genomics research on copepods is needed to extend our exploration and characterization of their fundamental biological traits, so that we can better understand how copepods function and interact in diverse environments. Availability of large scale genomics resources will also open doors to a wide range of systems biology type studies that view the organism as the fundamental system in which to address key questions in ecology and evolution.",2011,"genome organization; ecogenomics; parasitism and symbiosis; biological invasion; diapause; response to environmental change","Article","ISI"

"Gene Network Visualization and Quantitative Synteny Analysis of more than 300 Marine T4-Like Phage Scaffolds from the GOS Metagenome","10.1093/molbev/msq076","Comeau, AM; Arbiol, C; Krisch, HM","Bacteriophages (phages) are the most abundant biological entities in the biosphere and are the dominant organisms in marine environments, exerting an enormous influence on marine microbial populations. Metagenomic projects, such as the Global Ocean Sampling expedition (GOS), have demonstrated the predominance of tailed phages (Caudovirales), particularly T4 superfamily cyanophages (Cyano-T4s), in the marine milieu. Whereas previous metagenomic analyses were limited to gene content information, here we present a comparative analysis of over 300 phage scaffolds assembled from the viral fraction of the GOS data. This assembly permits the examination of synteny (organization) of the genes on the scaffolds and their comparison with the genome sequences from cultured Cyano-T4s. We employ comparative genomics and a novel usage of network visualization software to show that the scaffold phylogenies are similar to those of the traditional marker genes they contain. Importantly, these uncultured metagenomic scaffolds quite closely match the organization of the core genome of the known Cyano-T4s. This indicates that the current view of genome architecture in the Cyano-T4s is not seriously biased by being based on a small number of cultured phages, and we can be confident that they accurately reflect the diverse population of such viruses in marine surface waters.",2010,"t4-like phage; cyanophage; metagenome; synteny","Article","ISI"

Through comparative genomics we identified a great expansion of the underwater olfaction-related V2R gene family, consisting of more than 1,000 copies in both snakes. A series of chromosome rearrangements and genomic structural variations were recognized, including large inversions longer than 30 megabase (Mb) on sex chromosomes which potentially affect key functional genes associated with differentiated phenotypes between the two species. By integrating multiomics we found a significant loss of the major weapon for elapid predation, three-finger toxin genes, which displayed a dosage effect in H. curtus. These genetic changes may imply mechanisms that drove the divergent evolution of adaptive traits including prey preferences between the two closely related snakes.

"Marine Neurotoxins' Effects on Environmental and Human Health: An OMICS Overview","10.3390/md20010018","Guillotin, S; Delcourt, N","Harmful algal blooms (HAB), and the consequent release of toxic metabolites, can be responsible for seafood poisoning outbreaks. Marine wildlife can accumulate these toxins throughout the food chain, which presents a threat to consumers' health. Some of these toxins, such as saxitoxin (STX), domoic acid (DA), ciguatoxin (CTX), brevetoxin (BTX), tetrodotoxin (TTX), and beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA), cause severe neurological symptoms in humans. Considerable information is missing, however, notably the consequences of toxin exposures on changes in gene expression, protein profile, and metabolic pathways. This information could lead to understanding the consequence of marine neurotoxin exposure in aquatic organisms and humans. Nevertheless, recent contributions to the knowledge of neurotoxins arise from OMICS-based research, such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics.

Due to the lack of a universal conserved gene among all viruses, metagenomic fragment recruitment is commonly used to estimate the relative viral abundance. However, the paucity of absolute virus abundance data hinders our ability to fully understand how viruses drive global microbial populations. The cosmopolitan marine Pelagibacter ubique is host for the highly widespread HTVC010P pelagiphage isolate and the extremely abundant uncultured virus vSAG 37-F6 recently discovered by single-virus genomics. Here we applied droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to calculate the absolute abundance of these pelagiphage genotypes in the Mediterranean Sea and the Gulf of Maine. Abundances were between 360 and 8,510 virus mL-1 and 1,270-14,400 virus mL-1 for vSAG 37-F6 and HTVC010P, respectively. Illumina PCR-amplicon sequencing corroborated the absence of ddPCR non-specific amplifications for vSAG 37-F6, but showed an overestimation of 6% for HTVC010P from off-targets, genetically unrelated viruses. Absolute abundances of both pelagiphages, two of the most abundance marine viruses, suggest a large viral pelagiphage diversity in marine environments, and show the efficiency and power of ddPCR to disentangle the structure of marine viral communities.

How these patterns arise is, however, still not clear. Nelson et al. combine population genomics and genetic mapping of threespine... The outcome of selection on genetic variation depends on the geographic organization of individuals and populations as well as the organization of loci within the genome. Spatially variable selection between marine and freshwater habitats has had a significant and heterogeneous impact on patterns of genetic variation across the genome of threespine stickleback fish. When marine stickleback invade freshwater habitats, more than a quarter of the genome can respond to divergent selection, even in as little as 50 years. This process largely uses standing genetic variation that can be found ubiquitously at low frequency in marine populations, can be millions of years old, and is likely maintained by significant bidirectional gene flow. Here, we combine population genomic data of marine and freshwater stickleback from Cook Inlet, Alaska, with genetic maps of stickleback fish derived from those same populations to examine how linkage to loci under selection affects genetic variation across the stickleback genome. Divergent selection has had opposing effects on linked genetic variation on chromosomes from marine and freshwater stickleback populations: near loci under selection, marine chromosomes are depauperate of variation, while these same regions among freshwater genomes are the most genetically diverse. Forward genetic simulations recapitulate this pattern when different selective environments also differ in population structure. Lastly, dense genetic maps demonstrate that the interaction between selection and population structure may impact large stretches of the stickleback genome. These findings advance our understanding of how the structuring of populations across geography influences the outcomes of selection, and how the recombination landscape broadens the genomic reach of selection.",2019,"population genomics; linked selection; recombination; adaptation; threespine stickleback; gasterosteus aculeatus","Article","ISI"

Two types of V. fischeri strains have been distinguished based upon their behavior in cocolonization competition assays in juvenile E. scolopes, i.e., (i) niche-sharing or (ii) niche-dominant behavior. This study aimed to determine whether these behaviors are observed with other V. fischeri strains or whether they are specific to those isolated from E. scolopes light organs. Cocolonization competition assays between V. fischeri strains isolated from the congeneric squid E. morsei or from other marine animals revealed the same sharing or dominant behaviors. In addition, whole-genome sequencing of these strains showed that the dominant behavior is polyphyletic and not associated with the presence or absence of a single gene or genes. Comparative genomics of 44 squid light organ isolates from around the globe led to the identification of symbiosis-specific candidates in the genomes of these strains. Colonization assays using genetic derivatives with deletions of these candidates established the importance of two such genes in colonization. This study has allowed us to expand the concept of distinct colonization behaviors to strains isolated from a number of squid and fish hosts. IMPORTANCE There is an increasing recognition of the importance of strain differences in the ecology of a symbiotic bacterial species and, in particular, how these differences underlie crucial interactions with their host. Nevertheless, little is known about the genetic bases for these differences, how they manifest themselves in specific behaviors, and their distribution among symbionts of different host species. In this study, we sequenced the genomes of Vibrio fischeri isolated from the tissues of squids and fishes and applied comparative genomics approaches to look for patterns between symbiont lineages and host colonization behavior. In addition, we identified the only two genes that were exclusively present in all V. fischeri strains isolated from the light organs of sepiolid squid species. Mutational studies of these genes indicated that they both played a role in colonization of the squid light organ, emphasizing the value of applying a comparative genomics approach in the study of symbioses.",2020,"vibrio (aliivibrio) fischeri; genomes; dominance; symbiosis; intraspecific; aliivibrio; vibrio fischeri; genome analysis","Article","ISI"

Here, we analyse coding sequence polymorphism and divergence patterns in the fascinating Lineus ribbon worms, a group of marine, carnivorous nemerteans with unusual regeneration abilities, and in which asexual reproduction by fissiparity is documented. The population genomics of the fissiparous L. pseudolacteus is characterized by an extremely high level of heterozygosity and unexpectedly elevated pi(N)/pi(S) ratio, in apparent agreement with theoretical expectations under clonal evolution. Analysis of among-species allele sharing and read-count distribution, however, reveals that L. pseudolacteus is a triploid hybrid between Atlantic populations of L. sanguineus and L. lacteus. We model and quantify the relative impact of hybridity, polyploidy and asexuality on molecular variation patterns in L. pseudolacteus and conclude that (i) the peculiarities of L. pseudolacteus population genomics result in the first place from hybridization and (ii) the accumulation of new mutations through the Meselson effect is more than compensated by processes of heterozygosity erosion, such as gene conversion or gene copy loss.

Metabolomics measures all (or a subset) metabolites in a cell at a specific time point, reflecting a snapshot of all the regulatory events responding to the external environmental conditions. Although metabolomics and systems biology approaches have been applied to the study of terrestrial plants, few marine macrophytes have been examined using these novel technologies. Marine macrophytes (including seaweeds and seagrasses) are marine ecosystem engineers delivering a range of ecologically and economically valuable biological services; however they are under threat from a wide range of anthropogenic stressors, climate variation, invasive species and pathogens. Investigating metabolomic regulation in these organisms is crucial to understand their acclimation, adaptation and defence responses to environmental challenges. This review describes the current analytical tools available to study metabolomics in marine macrophytes, along with their limitations for both targeted and non-targeted workflows. To illustrate recent advances in systems biology studies in marine macrophytes, we describe how metabolites are used in chemical defence to deter a broad range of invasive species and pathogens, as well as metabolomic reprogramming leading to acclimation or adaptive strategies to environmental and anthropogenic stresses. Where possible, the mechanistic processes associated with primary and secondary plant metabolism governing cellular homeostasis under extreme environments are discussed. Further, we provide a comprehensive overview of an in silico plant metabolome database that can be utilized to advance our knowledge from a system biology approach to marine macrophytes. Finally, functional integration of metabolomics with the allied omics disciplines of transcriptomics and proteomics, as well as the emerging discipline of fluxomics are discussed in the context of developing biological system networks, the identification of unknown gene/protein functions and the analysis of metabolic pathways in marine plants exposed to stress.

This is basically foreseen to cope with the heterogeneity of organic matter supplied to these systems. Nevertheless, it is not known what fraction of a generalist proteome is needed for house-keeping functions or what fraction is modified to cope with environmental changes. Here, we used high-throughput proteomics to define the proteome of Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS-3, a model marine generalist bacterium of the Roseobacter clade. We evaluated its genome expression under several natural environmental conditions, revealing the versatility of the bacterium to adapt to anthropogenic influence, poor nutrient concentrations or the presence of the natural microbial community. We also assayed 30 different laboratory incubations to increase proteome coverage and to dig further into the functional genomics of the bacterium. We established its core proteome and the proteome devoted to adaptation to general cellular physiological variations (almost 50%).

We compared the performance of the FC-CS-sequencing and total DNA extraction-sequencing to study the stomach microbiota of the Humboldt Current krill. Non-specific amplification was not retrieved in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from cells sorted, opposite to the observed using the DNA from the whole lysate. Sequences obtained from the whole stomach DNA were enriched in picocyanobacteria, whereas sequences retrieved from cells sorted belonged almost exclusively to Balneola sp. of the new phylum Balneolaeota.

Streptomyces appears as one of the main sources of these enzymes, but complete genome sequences of keratinolytic bacteria are still limited. This article reports the complete genomes of three marine-derived streptomycetes that show different levels of feather keratin degradation, with high (strain G11C), low (strain CHD11), and no (strain Vc74B-19) keratinolytic activity. A multi-step bioinformatics approach is described to explore genes encoding putative keratinases in these genomes. Despite their differential keratinolytic activity, multiplatform annotation reveals similar quantities of ORFs encoding putative proteases in strains G11C, CHD11, and Vc74B-19. Comparative genomics classified these putative proteases into 140 orthologous groups and 17 unassigned orthogroup peptidases belonging to strain G11C. Similarity network analysis revealed three network communities of putative peptidases related to known keratinases of the peptidase families S01, S08, and M04. When combined with the prediction of cellular localization and phylogenetic reconstruction, seven putative keratinases from the highly keratinolytic strain Streptomyces sp. G11C are identified.

However, a lack of genomic resources and challenges associated with collecting high-quality RNA can limit its application for many wild populations. Minimally invasive blood sampling combined with de novo transcriptomic approaches has great potential to alleviate these barriers. Here, we advance these goals for marine turtles by generating high quality de novo blood transcriptome assemblies to characterize functional diversity and compare global transcriptional profiles between tissues, species, and foraging aggregations.ResultsWe generated high quality blood transcriptome assemblies for hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata), loggerhead (Caretta caretta), green (Chelonia mydas), and leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea) turtles. The functional diversity in assembled blood transcriptomes was comparable to those from more traditionally sampled tissues. A total of 31.3% of orthogroups identified were present in all four species, representing a core set of conserved genes expressed in blood and shared across marine turtle species. We observed strong species-specific expression of these genes, as well as distinct transcriptomic profiles between green turtle foraging aggregations that inhabit areas of greater or lesser anthropogenic disturbance.ConclusionsObtaining global gene expression data through non-lethal, minimally invasive sampling can greatly expand the applications of RNA-sequencing in protected long-lived species such as marine turtles. The distinct differences in gene expression signatures between species and foraging aggregations provide insight into the functional genomics underlying the diversity in this ancient vertebrate lineage.

The concentrations of some intracellular metabolites were elevated in the P-deficient cells (e.g. xanthine, inosine), and genes involved in the associated metabolic pathways shared a predicted conserved amino acid motif in the non-coding regions of each gene. The presence of the conserved motif suggests that these genes may be co-regulated, and the motif may constitute a regulatory element for binding a transcription factor, specifically that of Psr1 (phosphate starvation response). A putative phosphate starvation response gene (psr1-like) was identified in M. pusilla with homology to well characterized psr1/phr1 genes in algae and plants, respectively. This gene appears to be present and expressed in other marine algal taxa (e.g. EmiBanta huxleyi) in field sites that are chronically P limited. Results from the present study have implications for understanding phytoplankton taxon-specific roles in mediating P cycling in the ocean.",2021,"micromonas pusilla; phosphate stress response; marine algae; metabolomics; dissolved organic matter; biological oceanography","Article","ISI"

However, species with large genomes remain challenging, hampering the development of genomic resources for a number of taxa including marine arthropods. Here, we developed a genome-reduced representation method for the ecologically important marine copepod Calanus finmarchicus (haploid genome size of 6.34 Gbp). We optimized a capture enrichment-based protocol based on 2656 single-copy genes, yielding a total of 154 087 high-quality SNPs in C. finmarchicus including 62 372 in common among the three locations tested. The set of capture probes was also successfully applied to the congeneric C. glacialis. Preliminary analyses of these markers revealed similar levels of genetic diversity between the two Calanus species, while populations of C. glacialis showed stronger genetic structure compared to C. finmarchicus. Using this powerful set of markers, we did not detect any evidence of hybridization between C. finmarchicus and C. glacialis. Finally, we propose a shortened version of our protocol, offering a promising solution for population genomics studies in non-model species with large genomes.",2019,"genome reduced-representation; sequence capture enrichment; calanus spp.","Article","ISI"
"Estimation of the Genome Sizes of Males and Females in the Marine Green Alga Monostroma angicava Using Flow Cytometry","10.1508/cytologia.85.169","Yoshida, K; Horinouchi, Y; Watanabe, M; Togashi, T","Genome size provides important information in ecology and evolution as well as genomics. Genome size may be different between the sexes within a species. However, little information on the genome size of both sexes is available, particularly in ulvophycean marine green algae, because few methods of genome size estimation are suitable for these algae. We developed a method to examine the genome sizes of males and females in the dioicous ulvophycean marine green alga Monostroma angicava. We examined three methods to isolate haploid nuclei: 1) chopping of a haploid gametophyte; 2) homogenization of protoplasts made from haploid gametophyte cells; and 3) homogenization of gametes and found homogenization of gametes to be the most suitable method for isolation of nuclei in M. angicava. Isolated nuclei were stained with propidium iodide. We measured the fluorescence intensity of nuclei using flow cytometry and successfully estimated the genome sizes of males and females as 178.8 Mbp and 185.4 Mbp, respectively, using Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica rapa as standard plants with an internal standard method. The genome size of males was slightly smaller than that of females. This may be due to the difference in the length of sex-specific genome regions.",2020,"dna content; flow cytometry; genome size; green alga; monostroma angicava; nuclei isolation","Article","ISI"
"Marine integrons containing novel integrase genes, attachment sites, attI, and associated gene cassettes in polluted sediments from Suez and Tokyo Bays","10.1038/ismej.2010.208","Elsaied, H; Stokes, HW; Kitamura, K; Kurusu, Y; Kamagata, Y; Maruyama, A","In order to understand the structure and biological significance of integrons and associated gene cassettes in marine polluted sediments, metagenomic DNAs were extracted from sites at Suez and Tokyo Bays. PCR amplicons containing new integrase genes, intI, linked with novel gene cassettes, were recovered and had sizes from 1.8 to 2.5 kb. This approach uncovered, for the first time, the structure and diversity of both marine integron attachment site, attI, and the first gene cassette, the most efficiently expressed integron-associated gene cassette. The recovered 13 and 20 intI phylotypes, from Suez and Tokyo Bay samples, respectively, showed a highly divergence, suggesting a difference in integron composition between the sampling sites. Some intI phylotypes showed similarity with that from Geobacter metallireducens, belonging to Deltaproteobacteria, the dominant class in both sampling sites, as determined by 16S rRNA gene analysis. Thirty distinct families of putative attI site, as determined by the presence of an attI-like simple site, were recovered. A total of 146 and 68 gene cassettes represented Suez and Tokyo Bay unsaturated cassette pools, respectively. Gene cassettes, including a first cassette, from both sampling sites encoded two novel families of glyoxalase/bleomycin antibiotic-resistance protein. Gene cassettes from Suez Bay encoded proteins similar to haloacid dehalogenases, protein disulfide isomerases and death-on-curing and plasmid maintenance system killer proteins. First gene cassettes from Tokyo Bay encoded a xenobiotic-degrading protein, cardiolipin synthetase, esterase and WD40-like beta propeller protein. Many of the first gene cassettes encoded proteins with no ascribable function but some of them were duplicated and possessed signal functional sites, suggesting efficient adaptive functions to their bacterial sources. Thus, each sampling site had a specific profile of integrons and cassette types consistent with the hypothesis that the environment shapes the genome.

Genomics-assisted aquaculture can increase yield while preserving the environment to ensure sufficient and sustainable production for global food security. However, only few high-quality genome sequences of marine organisms, especially shellfish, are available to the public partly because of the difficulty in the sequence assembly due to the complex nature of their genomes. A key step for a successful genome sequencing is the preparation of high-quality high molecular weight (HMW) genomic DNA. This study evaluated the effectiveness of five DNA extraction protocols (CTAB, Genomic-tip, Mollusc DNA, TIANamp Marine Animals DNA, and Sbeadex livestock kits) in obtaining shrimp HMW DNA for a long-read sequencing platform. DNA samples were assessed for quality and quantity using a Qubit fluorometer, NanoDrop spectrophotometer and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Among the five extraction methods examined without further optimization, the Genomic-tip kit yielded genomic DNA with the highest quality. However, further modifications of these established protocols might yield even better DNA quality and quantity. To further investigate whether the obtained genomic DNA could be used in a long-read sequencing application, DNA samples from the top three extraction methods (CTAB method, Genomic-tip and Mollusc DNA kits) were used for Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) library construction and sequencing. Genomic DNA obtained from Genomic-tip and Mollusc DNA kits allowed successful library construction, while the DNA obtained from the CTAB method did not. Genomic DNA isolated using the Genomic-tip kit yielded a higher number of long reads (N50 of 14.57 Kb) than those obtained from Mollusc DNA kits (N50 of 9.74 Kb). Thus, this study identified an effective extraction method for high-quality HMW genomic DNA of shrimp that can be applied to other marine organisms for a long-read sequencing platform.",2020,"dna extraction method; long-read sequencing platform; marine organism","Article","ISI"

Polar cod Boreogadus saida (Lepechin, 1774) is an abundant circumpolar marine fish and ecological key species. The central role of polar cod in the Arctic marine food web warrants a better understanding of its population structure and connectivity. In this study, the genetic population structure of 171 juveniles, collected from several fjords off West-Svalbard (Billefjorden, Hornsund and Kongsfjorden), the northern Sophia Basin and the Eurasian Basin of the Arctic Ocean, was analysed using nine DNA microsatellite loci. Genetic analyses indicated moderate to high genetic diversity, but absence of spatial population structure and isolation-by-distance, suggesting ongoing gene flow between the studied sampling regions. High levels of connectivity may be key for polar cod to maintain populations across wide spatial scales. The adaptive capacity of the species will be increasingly important to face challenges such as habitat fragmentation, ocean warming and changes in prey composition. In view of a limited understanding of the population dynamics and evolution of polar cod, a valuable next step to predict future developments should be an integrated biological evaluation, including population genomics, a life-history approach, and habitat and biophysical dispersal modelling.",2021,"central arctic ocean; connectivity; dna microsatellites; population differentiation; population structure","Article","ISI"

We herein describe the profound potential of Alteromonas sp. 76-1, isolated from alginate-enriched seawater at the Patagonian continental shelf, to degrade the algal polysaccharides alginate and ulvan. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that strain 76-1 might represent a novel species, distinguished from its closest relative (Alteromonas naphthalenivorans) by adaptations to their contrasting habitats (productive open ocean vs. coastal sediments). Ecological distinction of 76-1 was particularly manifested in the abundance of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), consistent with its isolation from alginate-enriched seawater and elevated abundance of a related OTU in the original microcosm. Strain 76-1 encodes multiple alginate lyases from families PL6, PL7, PL17, and PL18 largely contained in two polysaccharide utilization loci (PUL), which may facilitate the utilization of different alginate structures in nature. Notably, ulvan degradation relates to a 126 Kb plasmid dedicated to polysaccharide utilization, encoding several PL24 and PL25 ulvan lyases and monomer-processing genes. This extensive and versatile CAZyme repertoire allowed substantial growth on polysaccharides, showing comparable doubling times with alginate (2 h) and ulvan (3 h) in relation to glucose (3 h). The finding of homologous ulvanolytic systems in distantly related Alteromonas spp. suggests CAZyme plasmids as effective vehicles for PUL transfer that mediate niche gain. Overall, the demonstrated CAZyme repertoire substantiates the role of Alteromonas in marine polysaccharide degradation and how PUL exchange influences the ecophysiology of this ubiquitous marine taxon.",2019,"alginate; ulvan; polysaccharide utilization loci; unique genes; niche specialization","Article","ISI"

Compared with their cultured relatives, they frequently exhibit a streamlined genome, reduced G+C content and distinct gene repertoire. These genomic traits are relevant to environmental adaptation, and have generally been thought to become fixed in marine bacterial populations through selection. Using single-cell genomics, we sequenced four uncultivated cells affiliated with the ecologically relevant Roseobacter clade and used a composition-heterogeneous Bayesian phylogenomic model to resolve these single-cell genomes into a new clade. This lineage has no representatives in culture, yet accounts for similar to 35% of Roseobacters in some surface ocean waters. Analyses of multiple genomic traits, including genome size, G+C content and percentage of noncoding DNA, suggest that these single cells are representative of oceanic Roseobacters but divergent from isolates. Population genetic analyses showed that substitution of physicochemically dissimilar amino acids and replacement of G+C-rich to G+C-poor codons are accelerated in the uncultivated clade, processes that are explained equally well by genetic drift as by the more frequently invoked explanation of natural selection. The relative importance of drift vs selection in this clade, and perhaps in other marine bacterial clades with streamlined G+C-poor genomes, remains unresolved until more evidence is accumulated.",2014,"roseobacter; single-cell genomics; gc content; natural selection; genetic drift; genome streamlining","Article","ISI"

We show L. variegatus has 19 chromosomes with an assembly size of 870.4Mb. The contiguity and completeness of this assembly are reflected by a scaffold length N50 of 45.5Mb and BUSCO completeness score of 95.5%.

Repetitive regions, on the other hand, make up 45.4% of the genome. Physical mapping of well-studied developmental genes onto each chromosome reveals nonrandom spatial distribution of distinct genes and gene families, which provides insight into how certain gene families may have evolved and are transcriptionally regulated in this species. Lastly, aligning RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data onto this assembly demonstrates the value of highly contiguous, complete genome assemblies for functional genomics analyses that is unattainable with fragmented, incomplete assemblies.

Although all 12 Cellulophaga phages represent new genera, the podoviruses and icosahedral, nontailed ssDNA phages were exceptional, with genomes up to twice as large as those previously observed for each phage type. Structural novelty was also substantial, requiring experimental phage proteomics to identify 83% of the structural proteins. The presence of uncommon nucleotide metabolism genes in four genera likely underscores the importance of scavenging nutrient-rich molecules as previously seen for phages in marine environments. Metagenomic recruitment analyses suggest that these particular Cellulophaga phages are rare and may represent a first glimpse into the phage side of the rare biosphere. However, these analyses also revealed that these phage genera are widespread, occurring in 94% of 137 investigated metagenomes. Together, this diverse and novel collection of phages identifies a small but ubiquitous fraction of unknown marine viral diversity and provides numerous environmentally relevant phage-host systems for experimental hypothesis testing.",2013,"model systems; phage genomics; phage taxonomy; queuosine biosynthesis; prophage","Article","ISI"
"Dissemination of Genetic Acquisition/Loss Provides a Variety of Quorum Sensing Regulatory Properties in Pseudoalteromonas","10.3390/ijms19113636","Yu, ZL; Ding, YJ; Yin, JH; Yu, DL; Zhang, JD; Zhang, MT; Ding, MD; Zhong, WH; Qiu, JP; Li, J","Quorum sensing (QS) enables single-celled bacteria to communicate with chemical signals in order to synchronize group-level bacterial behavior. Pseudoalteromonas are marine bacteria found in versatile environments, of which QS regulation for their habitat adaptation is extremely fragmentary. To distinguish genes required for QS regulation in Pseudoalteromonas, comparative genomics was deployed to define the pan-genomics for twelve isolates and previously-sequenced genomes, of which acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL)-based QS traits were characterized. Additionally, transposon mutagenesis was used to identify the essential QS regulatory genes in the selected Pseudoalteromonas isolate. A remarkable feature showed that AHL-based colorization intensity of biosensors induced by Pseudoalteromonas most likely correlates with QS regulators genetic heterogeneity within the genus. This is supported by the relative expression levels of two of the main QS regulatory genes (luxO and rpoN) analyzed in representative Pseudoalteromonas isolates. Notably, comprehensive QS regulatory schema and the working model proposed in Pseudoalteromonas seem to phylogenetically include the network architectures derived from Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas, and Vibrio. Several associated genes were mapped by transposon mutagenesis. Among them, a right origin-binding protein-encoding gene (robp) was functionally identified as a positive QS regulatory gene. This gene lies on a genomic instable region and exists in the aforementioned bioinformatically recruited QS regulatory schema. The obtained data emphasize that the distinctly- and hierarchically-organized mechanisms probably target QS association in Pseudoalteromonas dynamic genomes, thus leading to bacterial ability to accommodate their adaption fitness and survival advantages.",2018,"quorum sensing; pseudoalteromonas; regulatory architecture; dissemination; horizontal transfer","Article","ISI"

Traditionally, these evolutionarily diverse organisms have been combined into a single functional group (heterotrophic flagellates), overlooking their organismal differences. Here, we investigated four evolutionarily related species belonging to one cosmopolitan group of uncultured marine picoeukaryotic predators: marine stramenopiles (MAST)-4 (species A, B, C, and E). Co-occurrence and distribution analyses in the global surface ocean indicated contrasting patterns in MAST-4A and C, suggesting adaptation to different temperatures. We then investigated whether these spatial distribution patterns were mirrored by MAST-4 genomic content using single-cell genomics. Analyses of 69 single cells recovered 66 to 83% of the MAST-4A/B/C/E genomes, which displayed substantial interspecies divergence. MAST-4 genomes were similar in terms of broad gene functional categories, but they differed in enzymes of ecological relevance, such as glycoside hydrolases (GHs), which are part of the food degradation machinery in MAST-4. Interestingly, MAST-4 species featuring a similar GH composition (A and C) coexcluded each other in the surface global ocean, while species with a different set of GHs (B and C) appeared to be able to coexist, suggesting further niche diversification associated with prey digestion. We propose that differential niche adaptation to temperature and prey type has promoted adaptive evolutionary diversification in MAST-4. We show that minute ocean predators from the same phylogenetic group may have different biogeography and genomic content, which needs to be accounted for to better comprehend marine food webs.",2021,"protists; mast-4; biogeography; ecoevolution; phagocytosis","Article","ISI"

Coralligenous reefs are highly diverse habitats endemic to the Mediterranean Sea built by calcareous benthic organisms among which Crustose Coralline Algae are the main engineering species. We analyzed the diversity of Lithophyllum stictiforme or L. cabiochiae in coralligenous habitats combining a multiple barcode and a population genomics approach with seascape features. Population genomics allowed disentangling pure spatial effects from environmental effects. We found that these taxa form a complex of eight highly divergent cryptic species that are easily identifiable using classic barcode markers (psbA, LSU, COI). Three factors have a significant effect on the relative abundances of these cryptic species: the location along the French Mediterranean coast, depth and Photosynthetic Active Radiation (PAR). The analysis of around 5000 SNPs for the most abundant species revealed genetic differentiation among localities in the Bay of Marseille but no differentiation between depths within locality. Thus, the effect of depth and PAR on cryptic species communities is not a consequence of restricted connectivity but rather due to differential settlement or survival among cryptic species. This differential is more likely driven by irradiance levels rather than by pressure or temperature. Both the genetic and species diversity patterns are congruent with the main patterns of currents in the Bay. Ecological differentiation among these engineering cryptic species, sensitive to ocean warming and acidification, could have important consequences on the diversity and structure of the coralligenous communities.",2019,"engineering species; cryptic species; ecological niche; coralligenous habitats; ecological differentiation; crustose coralline algae","Article","ISI"
"A Few Stickleback Suffice for the Transport of Alleles to New Lakes","10.1534/g3.119.400564","Galloway, J; Cresko, WA; Ralph, P","Threespine stickleback populations provide a striking example of local adaptation to divergent habitats in populations that are connected by recurrent gene flow. These small fish occur in marine and freshwater habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere, and in numerous cases the smaller freshwater populations have been established de novo from marine colonists. Independently evolved freshwater populations exhibit similar phenotypes that have been shown to derive largely from the same standing genetic variants. Geographic isolation prevents direct migration between the freshwater populations, strongly suggesting that these shared locally adaptive alleles are transported through the marine population. However it is still largely unknown how gene flow, recombination, and selection jointly impact the standing variation that might fuel this adaptation. Here we use individual-based, spatially explicit simulations to determine the levels of gene flow that best match observed patterns of allele sharing among habitats in stickleback. We aim to better understand how gene flow and local adaptation in large metapopulations determine the speed of adaptation and re-use of standing genetic variation. In our simulations we find that repeated adaptation uses a shared set of alleles that are maintained at low frequency by migration-selection balance in oceanic populations. This process occurs over a realistic range of intermediate levels of gene flow that match previous empirical population genomic studies in stickleback. Examining these simulations more deeply reveals how lower levels of gene flow leads to slow, independent adaptation to different habitats, whereas higher levels of gene flow leads to significant mutation load - but an increased probability of successful population genomic scans for locally adapted alleles. Surprisingly, we find that the genealogical origins of most freshwater adapted alleles can be traced back to the original generation of marine individuals that colonized the lakes, as opposed to subsequent migrants. These simulations provide deeper context for existing studies of stickleback evolutionary genomics, and guidance for future empirical studies in this model. More broadly, our results support existing theory of local adaptation but extend it by more completely documenting the genealogical history of adaptive alleles in a metapopulation.",2020,"local adaptation; threespine stickleback; genomic simulation","Article","ISI"

Molecular ecological studies have been instrumental in advancing such understanding, and while initially focused primarily on broad-scale patterns, they have gradually uncovered the prevalence of local genetic structuring. Genomewide sequencing approaches have provided new opportunities to understand both neutral and adaptive contributions to this largely unexplained diversity, but fine-scale assessments have been hampered by challenges associated with aquatic environments, in terms of (geo)referencing, seafloor characterization, and in situ phenotyping. Here, we discuss the potential of reefscape genomics, leveraging recent advances in underwater imaging to enable spatially explicit genomic studies on coral reefs. More specifically, we consider how (close-range) photogrammetry approaches enable (1) fine scale spatial mapping of benthic target organisms, (2) repeatable characterization of the abiotic and biotic reefscape, and (3) simultaneous in situ mass-phenotyping. The spatially explicit consideration of genomic data -combined with detailed environmental and phenotypic characterization- opens up the opportunity for fine-scale landscape genomic approaches on coral reefs (and other marine ecosystems). Such approaches enable assessment of the spatio-temporal drivers and adaptive potential of the extensive genetic structuring and cryptic diversity encountered in benthic invertebrates, such as reef-building corals. Considering the threats that coral reefs are facing worldwide, we believe that reefscape genomics represents a promising advancement of our molecular ecological toolkit to help inform how we can most effectively conserve and restore coral reef ecosystems into the future.",2021,"reefscape genomics; seascape genomics; coral reefs; photogrammetry; structure from motion; landscape genomics","Article","ISI"

"Evaluating legacy contaminants and emerging chemicals in marine environments using adverse outcome pathways and biological effects-directed analysis","10.1016/j.marpolbul.2013.06.012","Hutchinson, TH; Lyons, BP; Thain, JE; Law, RJ","Natural and synthetic chemicals are essential to our daily lives, food supplies, health care, industries and safe sanitation. At the same time protecting marine ecosystems and seafood resources from the adverse effects of chemical contaminants remains an important issue. Since the 1970s, monitoring of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (FBI) chemicals using analytical chemistry has provided important spatial and temporal trend data in three important contexts; relating to human health protection from seafood contamination, addressing threats to marine top predators and finally providing essential evidence to better protect the biodiversity of commercial and non-commercial marine species. A number of regional conventions have led to controls on certain PBT chemicals over several years (termed 'legacy contaminants'; e.g. cadmium, lindane, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs] and polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs]). Analytical chemistry plays a key role in evaluating to what extent such regulatory steps have been effective in leading to reduced emissions of these legacy contaminants into marine environments. In parallel, the application of biomarkers (e.g. DNA adducts, CYP1A-EROD, vitellogenin) and bioassays integrated with analytical chemistry has strengthened the evidence base to support an ecosystem approach to manage marine pollution problems. In recent years, however, the increased sensitivity of analytical chemistry, toxicity alerts and wider environmental awareness has led to a focus on emerging chemical contaminants (defined as chemicals that have been detected in the environment, but which are currently not included in regulatory monitoring programmes and whose fate and biological impacts are poorly understood). It is also known that natural chemicals (e.g. algal biotoxins) may also pose a threat to marine species and seafood quality. Hence complex mixtures of legacy contaminants, emerging chemicals and natural biotoxins in marine ecosystems represent important scientific, economic and health challenges. In order to meet these challenges and pursue cost-effective scientific approaches that can provide evidence necessary to support policy needs (e.g. the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive), it is widely recognised that there is a need to (i) provide marine exposure assessments for priority contaminants using a range of validated models, passive samplers and biomarkers; (ii) integrate chemical monitoring data with biological effects data across spatial and temporal scales (including quality controls); and (iii) strengthen the evidence base to understand the relationship between exposure to complex chemical mixtures, biological and ecological impacts through integrated approaches and molecular data (e.g. genomics, proteomics and metabolomics). Additionally, we support the widely held view that (iv) that rather than increasing the analytical chemistry monitoring of large number of emerging contaminants, it will be important to target analytical chemistry towards key groups of chemicals of concern using effects-directed analysis. It is also important to evaluate to what extent existing biomarkers and bioassays can address various classes of emerging chemicals using the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) approach now being developed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) with respect to human toxicology and ecotoxicology.

This has presented a significant challenge to marine ecosystem models, which are traditionally diversity poor, and often do not include adaptive/evolutionary processes. Here we explore the use of evolutionary individual-based models (IBMs) as a means of addressing some of these issues. In the IBM, we associate a digital 4genome' with each agent, which codes for the phenotypic traits of simulated organisms. Random mutations at the point of reproduction then allow adaptation in response to changing environmental conditions. Trade-offs between different physiological parameters result in different growth strategies emerging under different forcing scenarios. As an idealised test-case we consider resource competition in a chemostat environment, and compare the individual-based approach to a more traditional population-level model. When run in a non-evolutionary context using a clonal population of agents, the IBM reproduces the results of the population-level model. With evolutionary processes enabled, optimally adapted agents are observed to rise to prominence within the agent population. Their physiological trait values are shown to compare well with theoretical optimal trait combinations derived using resource competition theory. In more variable environments, the model is also shown to capture adaptation in response to changed environmental conditions. We conclude that IBMs represent a useful framework for building detailed models linking (sub-)individual-level processes to emergent ecosystem-level behaviour in simplified 0- or 1-D representations of the environment, which should complement global marine ecosystem models of high spatial complexity but necessarily simple process representation.

However, the genetic mechanisms underlying their abilities of distinguishing and defending against invading microbes are still unclear.ResultsHere, we describe the 2.06 Gbp genome assembly of Tachypleus tridentatus with 24,222 predicted protein-coding genes. Comparative genomics shows that T. tridentatus and the Atlantic horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus have the most orthologues shared among two species, including genes involved in the immune-related JAK-STAT signalling pathway. Divergence time dating results show that the last common ancestor of Asian horseshoe crabs (including T. tridentatus and C. rotundicauda) and L. polyphemus appeared approximately 130 Mya (121-141), and the split of the two Asian horseshoe crabs was dated to approximately 63 Mya (57-69). Hox gene analysis suggests two clusters in both horseshoe crab assemblies. Surprisingly, selective analysis of immune-related gene families revealed the high expansion of conserved pattern recognition receptors. Genes involved in the IMD and JAK-STAT signal transduction pathways also exhibited a certain degree of expansion in both genomes. Intact coagulation cascade-related genes were present in the T. tridentatus genome with a higher number of coagulation factor genes. Moreover, most reported antibacterial peptides have been identified in T. tridentatus with their potentially effective antimicrobial sites.ConclusionsThe draft genome of T. tridentatus would provide important evidence for further clarifying the taxonomy and evolutionary relationship of Chelicerata. The expansion of conserved immune signalling pathway genes, coagulation factors and intact antimicrobial peptides in T. tridentatus constitutes its robust and effective innate immunity for self-defence in marine environments with an enormous number of invading pathogens and may affect the quality of the adaptive properties with regard to complicated marine environments.",2020,"tachypleus tridentatus; genome; evolution; innate immunity; coagulation","Article","ISI"

Population genomics and ecological niche modelling offer complementary new tools for uncovering functional units of phylogenetic diversity. We hypothesize that phylogenetically delineated lineages of gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) distributed across Antarctica and sub-Antarctic Islands are subject to spatially explicit ecological conditions that have limited gene flow, facilitating genetic differentiation, and thereby speciation processes. Location Antarctica and sub-Antarctic area. Methods We identify divergent lineages for gentoo penguins using ddRAD-seq and mtDNA, and generated species distribution models (SDMs) based on terrestrial and marine parameters. Results Analyses of our genomic data supports the existence of four major lineages of gentoo penguin: (i) spanning the sub-Antarctic archipelagos north of the Antarctic Polar Front (APF); (ii) Kerguelen Island; (iii) South America; and (iv) across maritime Antarctic and the Scotia Arc archipelagos. The APF, a major current system around Antarctica, acts as the most important barrier separating regional sister lineages. Our ecological analyses spanning both the terrestrial (breeding sites) and marine (feeding sites) realms recover limited niche overlap among the major lineages of gentoo penguin. We observe this pattern to correspond more closely with regional differentiation of marine conditions than to terrestrial macroenvironmental features. Main conclusions Recognition of regional genetic lineages as discrete evolutionary entities that occupy distinct ecological niches and also differ morphologically should be considered a priority for conservation. Gentoo penguins provide a good example of how conservation policy can be directly impacted by new insights obtained through the integration of larger genomic datasets with novel approaches to ecological modelling.

We contrast these results with incursion pathways ofAe. aegypti, investigated previously. RESULTS Assignments successfully identified China, Japan, Singapore and Taiwan as source locations. Incursion pathways ofAe. albopictuswere entirely different to those ofAe. aegypti, despite broad sympatry of these species throughout the Indo-Pacific region. Incursions ofAe. albopictusappeared to have come predominantly along marine routes from key trading locations, whileAe. aegyptiwas mostly linked to aerial routes from tourism hotspots. CONCLUSION These results demonstrate how genomics can help decipher otherwise cryptic incursion pathways. The inclusion of reference genotypes from the Americas may help resolve some unsuccessful assignments. While many congeneric taxa will share common incursion pathways, this study highlights that this is not always the case, and incursion pathways of important taxa should be specifically investigated. Species differences in aerial and marine incursion rates may reflect the efficacy of ongoing control programmes such as aircraft disinsection.",2020,"aedes albopictus; aedes aegypti; biological invasions; assignment tests; genome-wide snps; incursion pathways","Article","ISI"

The maps were based on F-1 progeny from each of two single-pair mating families. A total of 237 nuclear-encoded microsatellite markers were mapped to 25 linkage groups. The female map contained 226 markers, with a total length of 1270.9 centiMorgans (cM) and an average inter-marker interval of 6.53 cM; the male map contained 201 markers, with a total length of 1122.9 cM and an average inter-marker interval of 6.03 cM. The overall recombination rate was approximately equal in the two sexes (female:male = 1.03:1). Recombination rates in a number of linkage intervals, however, differed significantly between the same sex in both families and between sexes within families. The former occurred in 2.4% of mapped intervals, while the latter occurred in 51.2% of mapped intervals. Sex-specific recombination rates varied within chromosomes, with regions of both female-biased and male-biased recombination. Original clones from which the microsatellite markers were generated were compared with genome sequence data for the spotted green puffer, Tetraodon nigroviridis; a total of 43 matches were located in 17 of 21 chromosomes of T. nigroviridis, while seven matches were in unknown portions of the T. nigroviridis genome.

The marine environments contain many contaminants of anthropogenic origin that have sufficient similarities to steroid and thyroid hormones, to potentially disrupt normal endocrine physiology in humans, fish, and other animals. An appropriate understanding of the effects of these endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) on forage fish (e.g., sardine, anchovy, mackerel) can lead to significant insight into how these contaminants may affect local ecosystems in addition to their potential impacts on human health. With advancements in molecular tools (e.g., high-throughput sequencing, HTS), a genomics approach offers a robust toolkit to discover putative genetic biomarkers in fish exposed to these chemicals. However, the lack of available sequence information for non-model species has limited the development of these genomic toolkits. Using HTS and de novo assembly technology, the present study aimed to establish, for the first time for Sardinops sagax (Pacific sardine), Scomber japonicas (Pacific chub mackerel) and Pleuronichthys verticalis (hornyhead turbot), a de novo global transcriptome database of the liver, the primary organ involved in detoxification. The assembled transcriptomes provide a foundation for further downstream validation, comparative genomic analysis and biomarker development for future applications in ecotoxicogenomic studies, as well as environmental evaluation (e.g., climate change) and public health safety (e.g., dietary screening).",2018,"sardine; mackerel; turbot; rna sequencing; de novo transcriptome assembly; genomic biomarkers","Article","ISI"

Transcript levels of the candidate reference genes were examined using qPCR analysis and showed differential expression patterns in the mantle, gill, adductor muscle, labial palp, visceral mass, hemolymph and gonad tissues. Quantitative data were analyzed using the geNorm software to assess the expression stability of the candidate reference genes, revealing that beta-TUB and UBQ were the most stable genes. The commonly used GAPDH and 18S rRNA showed low stability, making them unsuitable candidates in this system. The expression pattern of the G protein beta-subunit gene (G beta) across tissue types was also examined and normalized to the expression of each or both of UBQ and beta-TUB as internal controls. This revealed consistent trends with all three normalization approaches, thus validating the reliability of UBQ and beta-TUB as optimal internal controls.

However, the genetic mechanisms underlying their unique adaptive ability are still unclear. Here, we assembled the first chromosome-level T. tridentatus genome, and proved that this genome is of high quality with contig N50 1.69 Mb. By comparison with other arthropods, some gene families of T. tridentatus experienced significant expansion, which are related to several signaling pathways, endonuclease activities, and metabolic processes. Based on the results of comparative analysis of genomics and 27 transcriptomes from nine tissues, we found that the expanded Dscam genes are located at key hub positions of immune network. Furthermore, the Dscam genes showed higher levels of expression in the yellow connective tissue (the birthplace of blood cells with strong differentiation capability) than the other eight tissues. Besides, the Dscam genes are positively correlated with the expression of the core immunity gene, clotting factor B, which is involved in the coagulation cascade reaction. The effective and unusual immune ability endowed by the expansion and expression of Dscam genes in the horseshoe crab may be a factor that makes the species have a strong environmental adaptability within similar to 500 million years.

Strains of this pathogen isolated from diseased European sea bass in aquaculture facilities in the Turkish coast of the Black Sea were found to exhibit reduced sensitivity to multiple antimicrobials. Selected representative strains were subjected to complete genome sequencing and plasmid characterization. It was found that multidrug resistant (MDR) isolates harboured large conjugative plasmids sharing part of their sequence backbone with pAQU-group plasmids, hitherto reported exclusively in China and Japan. Four new pAQU-group versions of plasmids were identified in the present study, containing distinct combinations of the resistance determinants tetB, floR, sul2, qnrVC, dfrA and strAB. Conjugative transfer of pPHDD2-OG2, a representative plasmid of 170,998 bp, occurred at high frequencies (2.2 x 10(-2) transconjugants per donor cell), to E. coli and to pathogenic P. damselae subsp. damselae and subsp. piscicida strains. Upon transfer, pPHDD2-OG2 conferred reduced susceptibility to a number of antimicrobials to the recipient strains. Comparative genomics analysis of host strains suggested that these MDR plasmids of the pAQU-group were acquired by different genetic lineages of Pdd.

In this review, we synthesize the current knowledge of the invasion mechanisms and ecological impacts of Gracilaria vermiculophylla, a red agarophyte native to Asia Northwest Pacific, which now has become a rapid and successful coastal invader in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific Oceans. Eco-physiological and chemical studies have revealed that some ecological traits, including survival in dark condition (e.g. the ballast water), tolerance to grazing and extreme salinities and temperatures, insensitive to UVR and light intensity and nutrient levels, adaptation to a wide diversity of habitats, and chemical defense to potential predators, may provide G. vermiculophylla an unmatched advantage during its global invasion. The rapid growth, flexible reproduction through fragmentation, efficient recruitment on hard substratum, seeding success on various vectors, and interaction with local community organisms may also contribute to its rapid increase in abundance and effects on the invaded coastal ecosystems. G. vermiculophylla showed both negative and positive impacts to the marine ecosystems through changing interspecific competition, increasing habitat diversity, altering the community complex, and transforming biogeochemical cycles and estuarine food webs. Future surveys such as marine exotic genomics, transcriptome sequencing and epigenetic variation between native and invasive entities may provide insightful promise on molecular mechanisms of seaweed invasion.",2014,"ecological consequences; gracilaria vermiculophylla; habitat modifier; invasion mechanisms; seaweed","Article","ISI"

How long does diversification take and how much of the genome is affected? When divergence occurs in parallel from standing genetic variation, how often are the same haplotypes involved? We explore these questions using restriction site-associated DNA sequencing genotyping data and show that broad-scale genomic repatterning, fueled by copious standing variation, can emerge in just dozens of generations in replicate natural populations of threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus). After the catastrophic 1964 Alaskan earthquake, marine stickleback colonized newly created ponds on seismically uplifted islands. We find that freshwater fish in these young ponds differ from their marine ancestors across the same genomic segments previously shown to have diverged in much older lake populations. Outside of these core divergent regions the genome shows no population structure across the ocean-freshwater divide, consistent with strong local selection acting in alternative environments on stickleback populations still connected by significant gene flow. Reinforcing this inference, a majority of divergent haplotypes that are at high frequency in ponds are detectable in the sea, even across great geographic distances. Building upon previous population genomics work in this model species, our data suggest that a long history of divergent selection and gene flow among stickleback populations in oceanic and freshwater habitats has maintained polymorphisms of alternatively adapted DNA sequences that facilitate parallel evolution.",2018,"contemporary evolution; ecological divergence; population genomics; gasterosteus aculeatus; threespine stickleback","Article","ISI"

The viral sequence is 13,098 bp in length (including polyA), encoding four open reading frames (ORF). ORF-1 encodes a polyprotein, with three computationally discernible functional domains: viral methyltransferase; viral helicase; and RNA directed RNA polymerase. The remaining ORFs encode a transmembrane protein, a capsid protein and a protein of undetermined function. The raw transcriptomic data reveal a low level of background single nucleotide mutations within the data. Comparison of the protein sequence data and synteny with other viral isolates reveals that the greatest protein similarity (<39%) is shared with the Negevirus group, a group that exclusively infects insects. Phylogenetic assessment of the individual polyprotein domains revealed a mixed prediction of phylogenetic origins, suggesting with low confidence that the novel +ssRNA virus could be present in multiple places throughout the individual gene trees. A concatenated approach strongly suggested that this new virus is an early diverging isolate, branching before the Negevirus and Cilevirus groups. Alongside the new isolate are other marine viruses, also present toward the base of the tree.

Its browsing activity can deeply modify the littoral landscape, and changes in its abundance are of major conservation concern. This species is facing nowadays contrasting anthropogenic pressures linked to predator release, exploitation and sea warming. Management of this key species requires knowledge of its genetic structure, connectivity and local adaptation. Our goal was to assess the current global status of the species under a genomic perspective. Location Atlanto-Mediterranean shores from Morocco and France to Turkey. Methods We used genotyping by sequencing (GBS) of 241 individuals belonging to 11 populations spanning the known range of distribution of the species. We obtained 3,348 loci for population genomics and outlier analyses. Results We identified significant genetic structure and a gradient matching the longitudinal position of the localities. A hierarchical analysis revealed two main clusters (Atlantic and Mediterranean) and subtler patterns of differentiation within them. Candidate markers for selection identified between and within these two main clusters were mostly different, likely indicating different selective pressures. Adaptation to maximum salinity and maximum temperature appeared as an important driver of the transition between Atlantic and Mediterranean basins. Other stressors, such as minimum temperature or range of temperature, seem to define the structuring within the Mediterranean. Main conclusions Our study shows the potential of hierarchical analyses on population genomics to detect fine-scale genetic structure and adaptation signatures in marine species with long dispersal capabilities. Although genetic interchange occurs widely in Paracentrotus lividus, the species is sensitive to dispersal barriers, displays isolation by distance and faces local selective pressures associated to environmental conditions, all of which can render it more vulnerable than previously thought.",2020,"benthic communities; engineer species; genotyping by sequencing; oceanographic discontinuities; outlier analysis; population genomics; sea urchin","Article","ISI"

Small larval size, and difficulties in acceptance of inert microdiets, makes progress slow and cumbersome. This lack of knowledge in fish larval nutritional requirements is one of the causes of high mortalities and quality problems commonly observed in marine larviculture. In recent years, several novel methodologies have contributed to significant progress in fish larval nutrition. Others are emerging and are likely to bring further insight into larval nutritional physiology and requirements. This paper reviews a range of new tools and some examples of their present use, as well as potential future applications in the study of fish larvae nutrition. Tube-feeding and incorporation into Artemia of C-14-amino acids and lipids allowed studying Artemia intake, digestion and absorption and utilisation of these nutrients. Diet selection by fish larvae has been studied with diets containing different natural stable isotope signatures or diets where different rare metal oxides were added. Mechanistic modelling has been used as a tool to integrate existing knowledge and reveal gaps, and also to better understand results obtained in tracer studies. Population genomics may assist in assessing genotype effects on nutritional requirements, by using progeny testing in fish reared in the same tanks, and also in identifying QTLs for larval stages. Functional genomics and proteomics enable the study of gene and protein expression under various dietary conditions, and thereby identify the metabolic pathways which are affected by a given nutrient. Promising results were obtained using the metabolic programming concept in early life to facilitate utilisation of certain nutrients at later stages. All together, these methodologies have made decisive contributions, and are expected to do even more in the near future, to build a knowledge basis for development of optimised diets and feeding regimes for different species of larval fish.",2010,"fish larvae nutrition; genomics; proteomics; tracer studies; modelling; metabolic programming","Article","ISI"

It has been hypothesized that Pseudovibrio spp. form mutualistic relationships with their hosts. Here, we studied Pseudovibrio phylogeny and genetic adaptations that may play a role in host colonization by comparative genomics of 31 Pseudovibrio strains, including 25 sponge isolates. All genomes were highly similar in terms of encoded core metabolic pathways, albeit with substantial differences in overall gene content. Based on gene composition, Pseudovibrio spp. clustered by geographic region, indicating geographic speciation. Furthermore, the fact that isolates from the Mediterranean Sea clustered by sponge species suggested host-specific adaptation or colonization. Genome analyses suggest that Pseudovibrio hongkongensis UST20140214-015B(T) is only distantly related to other Pseudovibrio spp., thereby challenging its status as typical Pseudovibrio member. All Pseudovibrio genomes were found to encode numerous proteins with SEL1 and tetratricopeptide repeats, which have been suggested to play a role in host colonization. For evasion of the host immune system, Pseudovibrio spp. may depend on type III, IV, and VI secretion systems that can inject effector molecules into eukaryotic cells. Furthermore, Pseudovibrio genomes carry on average seven secondary metabolite biosynthesis clusters, reinforcing the role of Pseudovibrio spp. as potential producers of novel bioactive compounds. Tropodithietic acid, bacteriocin, and terpene biosynthesis clusters were highly conserved within the genus, suggesting an essential role in survival, for example through growth inhibition of bacterial competitors.

The core nonribosomal peptide gene null-mutant strains (Delta empC, Delta empD, and Delta empE) could not produce empedopeptin, while dioxygenase gene null-mutant strains (Delta empA and Delta empB) produced several unique empedopeptin analogs. However, the antibiotic activity of Delta empA and Delta empB was significantly reduced compared with the wild-type, demonstrating that the hydroxylated amino acid residues of empedopeptin and its analogs are important to their antibiotic activity.

To develop and implement measures that enhance species' adaptive potential to cope with those pressures while, at the same time, ensuring sustainable exploitation rates is part of the central goal of fisheries management. Here, we argue that a combination of biophysical modelling and population genomic assessments offer ideal management tools to define stocks, their physical connectivity and ultimately, their short-term adaptive potential. To date, biophysical modelling has often been confined to fisheries ecology whereas evolutionary hypotheses remain rarely considered. When identified, connectivity patterns are seldom explored to understand the evolution and distribution of adaptive genetic variation, a proxy for species' evolutionary potential. Here, we describe a framework that expands on the conventional seascape genetics approach by using biophysical modelling and population genomics. The goals are to identify connectivity patterns and selective pressures, as well as putative adaptive variants directly responding to the selective pressures and, ultimately, link both to define testable hypotheses over species response to shifting ecological conditions and overexploitation.",2018,"adaptive genetic variation; biophysical models; fisheries management; population genomics","Article","ISI"

"The genome of the intracellular bacterium of the coastal bivalve, Solemya velum: a blueprint for thriving in and out of symbiosis","10.1186/1471-2164-15-924","Dmytrenko, O; Russell, SL; Loo, WT; Fontanez, KM; Liao, L; Roeselers, G; Sharma, R; Stewart, FJ; Newton, ILG; Woyke, T; Wu, DY; Lang, JM; Eisen, JA; Cavanaugh, CM","Background: Symbioses between chemoautotrophic bacteria and marine invertebrates are rare examples of living systems that are virtually independent of photosynthetic primary production. These associations have evolved multiple times in marine habitats, such as deep-sea hydrothermal vents and reducing sediments, characterized by steep gradients of oxygen and reduced chemicals. Due to difficulties associated with maintaining these symbioses in the laboratory and culturing the symbiotic bacteria, studies of chemosynthetic symbioses rely heavily on culture independent methods. The symbiosis between the coastal bivalve, Solemya velum, and its intracellular symbiont is a model for chemosynthetic symbioses given its accessibility in intertidal environments and the ability to maintain it under laboratory conditions. To better understand this symbiosis, the genome of the S. velum endosymbiont was sequenced. Results: Relative to the genomes of obligate symbiotic bacteria, which commonly undergo erosion and reduction, the S. velum symbiont genome was large (2.7 Mb), GC-rich (51%), and contained a large number (78) of mobile genetic elements. Comparative genomics identified sets of genes specific to the chemosynthetic lifestyle and necessary to sustain the symbiosis. In addition, a number of inferred metabolic pathways and cellular processes, including heterotrophy, branched electron transport, and motility, suggested that besides the ability to function as an endosymbiont, the bacterium may have the capacity to live outside the host. Conclusions: The physiological dexterity indicated by the genome substantially improves our understanding of the genetic and metabolic capabilities of the S. velum symbiont and the breadth of niches the partners may inhabit during their lifecycle.",2014,"symbiosis; chemosynthesis; sulfur oxidation; respiratory flexibility; h+/na+ -membrane cycles; calvin cycle; pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase; heterotrophy; motility; mobile genetic elements","Article","ISI"
"Marine and Freshwater Plants: Challenges and Expectations","10.3389/fpls.2019.01545","Marechal, E","The past decades have seen an increasing interest on the biology of photosynthetic species living in aquatic environments, including diverse organisms collectively called algae. If we consider the relative size of scientific communities, marine and freshwater plants have been overall less studied than terrestrial ones. The efforts put on land plants were motivated by agriculture and forestry, applications for human industry, easy access to terrestrial ecosystems, and convenient cultivation methods in fields or growth chambers. By contrast, the fragmentary knowledge on the biology of algae, the hope to find in this biodiversity inspiration for biotechnologies, and the emergency created by the environmental crisis affecting oceans, lakes, rivers, or melting glaciers, have stressed the importance to make up for lost time. Needed efforts embrace a broad spectrum of disciplines, from environmental and evolutionary sciences, to molecular and cell biology. In this multiscale view, functional genomics and ecophysiology occupy a pivotal position linking molecular and cellular analyses and ecosystem-level studies. Without pretending to be exhaustive and with few selected references, six grand challenges, requiring multidisciplinary approaches, are introduced below.",2019,"algae; phytoplankton; seaweed; photosynthesis; endosymbiosis; bloom; holobiont; blue biotechnologies","Article","ISI"

Arctic Char (Salvelinus alpinus) is an anadromous salmonid and the most harvested fish species by Inuit people, including in Nunavik (Quebec, Canada), one of the most recently deglaciated regions in the world. Unlike many other anadromous salmonids, Arctic Char occupy coastal habitats near their natal rivers during their short marine phase restricted to the summer ice-free period. Our main objective was to document putatively neutral and adaptive genomic variation in anadromous Arctic Char populations from Nunavik and bordering regions to inform local fisheries management. We used genotyping by sequencing (GBS) to genotype 18,112 filtered single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in 650 individuals from 23 sampling locations along >2000 km of coastline. Our results reveal a hierarchical genetic structure, whereby neighboring hydrographic systems harbor distinct populations grouped by major oceanographic basins: Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Ungava Bay, and Labrador Sea. We found genetic diversity and differentiation to be consistent both with the expected postglacial recolonization history and with patterns of isolation-by-distance reflecting contemporary gene flow. Results from three gene-environment association methods supported the hypothesis of local adaptation to both freshwater and marine environments (strongest associations with sea surface and air temperatures during summer and salinity). Our results support a fisheries management strategy at a regional scale, and other implications for hatchery projects and adaptation to climate change are discussed.",2021,"anadromous salmonid; arctic; local adaptation; marine ecosystems; population genomics","Article","ISI"

The aquaculture production of R. philippinarum is under threat from diverse environmental factors including viruses, microorganisms, parasites, and water conditions with subsequently declining production. In spite of its importance as a marine resource, the reference genome of R. philippinarum for comprehensive genetic studies is largely unexplored. Here, we report the de novo whole-genome and transcriptome assembly of R. philippinarum across three different tissues (foot, gill, and adductor muscle), and provide the basic data for advanced studies in selective breeding and disease control in order to obtain successful aquaculture systems. An approximately 2.56 Gb high quality whole-genome was assembled with various library construction methods. A total of 108,034 protein coding gene models were predicted and repetitive elements including simple sequence repeats and noncoding RNAs were identified to further understanding of the genetic background of R. philippinarum for genomics-assisted breeding. Comparative analysis with the bivalve marine invertebrates uncover that the gene family related to complement C1q was enriched. Furthermore, we performed transcriptome analysis with three different tissues in order to support genome annotation and then identified 41,275 transcripts which were annotated. The R. philippinarum genome resource will markedly advance a wide range of potential genetic studies, a reference genome for comparative analysis of bivalve species and unraveling mechanisms of biological processes in molluscs.

"Geological and Geochemical Constraints on the Origin and Evolution of Life","10.1089/ast.2017.1778","Sleep, NH","The traditional tree of life from molecular biology with last universal common ancestor (LUCA) branching into bacteria and archaea (though fuzzy) is likely formally valid enough to be a basis for discussion of geological processes on the early Earth. Biologists infer likely properties of nodal organisms within the tree and, hence, the environment they inhabited. Geologists both vet tenuous trees and putative origin of life scenarios for geological and ecological reasonability and conversely infer geological information from trees. The latter approach is valuable as geologists have only weakly constrained the time when the Earth became habitable and the later time when life actually existed to the long interval between approximate to 4.5 and approximate to 3.85 Ga where no intact surface rocks are known. With regard to vetting, origin and early evolution hypotheses from molecular biology have recently centered on serpentinite settings in marine and alternatively land settings that are exposed to ultraviolet sunlight. The existence of these niches on the Hadean Earth is virtually certain. With regard to inferring geological environment from genomics, nodes on the tree of life can arise from true bottlenecks implied by the marine serpentinite origin scenario and by asteroid impact. Innovation of a very useful trait through a threshold allows the successful organism to quickly become very abundant and later root a large clade. The origin of life itself, that is, the initial Darwinian ancestor, the bacterial and archaeal roots as free-living cellular organisms that independently escaped hydrothermal chimneys above marine serpentinite or alternatively from shallow pore-water environments on land, the Selabacteria root with anoxygenic photosynthesis, and the Terrabacteria root colonizing land are attractive examples that predate the geological record. Conversely, geological reasoning presents likely events for appraisal by biologists. Asteroid impacts may have produced bottlenecks by decimating life. Thermophile roots of bacteria and archaea as well as a thermophile LUCA are attractive.",2018,"biology; bottlenecks; geology; land origin; marine serpentinite; tree of life","Article","ISI"
"Alterocin, an Antibiofilm Protein Secreted by Pseudoalteromonas sp.

The latter is active against marine and terrestrial bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical strains forming different biofilm types. Several amino acid sequences were obtained from the partially purified antibiofilm protein, named alterocin. The Pseudoalteromonas sp. 3J6 genome was sequenced, and a candidate alt gene was identified by comparing the genome-encoded proteins to the sequences from purified alterocin. Expressing the alt gene in another nonactive Pseudoalteromonas sp. strain, 3J3, demonstrated that it is responsible for the antibiofilm activity. Alterocin is a 139-residue protein that includes a predicted 20-residue signal sequence, which would be cleaved off upon export by the general secretion system. No sequence homology was found between alterocin and proteins of known functions. The alt gene is not part of an operon and adjacent genes do not seem related to alterocin production, immunity, or regulation, suggesting that these functions are not fulfilled by devoted proteins. During growth in liquid medium, the alt mRNA level peaked during the stationary phase. A single promoter was experimentally identified, and several inverted repeats could be binding sites for regulators. alt genes were found in about 30% of the Pseudoalteromonas genomes and in only a few instances of other marine bacteria of the Hahella and Paraglaciecola genera. Comparative genomics yielded the hypothesis that alt gene losses occurred within the Pseudoalteromonas genus. Overall, alterocin is a novel kind of antibiofilm protein of ecological and biotechnological interest. IMPORTANCE Biofilms are microbial communities that develop on solid surfaces or interfaces and are detrimental in a number of fields, including for example food industry, aquaculture, and medicine. In the latter, antibiotics are insufficient to clear biofilm infections, leading to chronic infections such as in the case of infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa of the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. Antibiofilm molecules are thus urgently needed to be used in conjunction with conventional antibiotics, as well as in other fields of application, especially if they are environmentally friendly molecules. Here, we describe alterocin, a novel antibiofilm protein secreted by a marine bacterium belonging to the Pseudoalteromonas genus, and its gene. Alterocin homologs were found in about 30% of Pseudoalteromonas strains, indicating that this new family of antibiofilm proteins likely plays an important albeit nonessential function in the biology of these bacteria. This study opens up the possibility of a variety of applications.",2020,"antibiofilm protein; pseudoalteromonas; pseudomonas aeruginosa; biofilm","Article","ISI"

A new low density oligonucleotide microarray was used to investigate global gene expression in the digestive gland of mussels. Target genes were selected to cover most of the biological processes involved in the stress response in bivalve mollusks (e.g. DNA metabolism, translation, immune response, cytoskeleton organization). A battery of classical biomarkers was also employed to complement the gene expression analyses. Chemical analysis revealed higher loads of heavy metals (Pb and Cu) and total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at PT compared to the other sites. In mussels deployed at CR, functional genomics analysis of the microarray data rendered 78 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in 11 biological processes. Animals exposed at PT had 105 DEGs that were characterized by the regulation of 14 biological processes, including mitochondrial activity, adhesion to substrate, DNA metabolism, translation, metal resistance, and cytoskeleton organization. Biomarker data (lysosomal membrane stability, lysosomal/cytoplasm volume ratio, lipofuscin accumulation, metallothionein content, micronucleus frequency, and cyloskeleton alteration) were in trend with transcriptomic output. Biomarker data were integrated using the Mussel Expert System (MES), allowing defining the area in which the presence of chemicals is toxic for mussels.

"Comparative Genomics Reveals High Genomic Diversity in the Genus Photobacterium","10.3389/fmicb.2017.01204","Machado, H; Gram, L","Vibrionaceae is a large marine bacterial family, which can constitute up to 50% of the prokaryotic population in marine waters. Photobacterium is the second largest genus in the family and we used comparative genomics on 35 strains representing 16 of the 28 species described so far, to understand the genomic diversity present in the Photobacterium genus. Such understanding is important for ecophysiology studies of the genus. We used whole genome sequences to evaluate phylogenetic relationships using several analyses (16S rRNA, MLSA, fur, amino-acid usage, ANI), which allowed us to identify two misidentified strains. Genome analyses also revealed occurrence of higher and lower GC content clades, correlating with phylogenetic clusters. Pan-and core-genome analysis revealed the conservation of 25% of the genome throughout the genus, with a large and open pan-genome. The major source of genomic diversity could be traced to the smaller chromosome and plasmids. Several of the physiological traits studied in the genus did not correlate with phylogenetic data. Since horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is often suggested as a source of genetic diversity and a potential driver of genomic evolution in bacterial species, we looked into evidence of such in Photobacterium genomes. Genomic islands were the source of genomic differences between strains of the same species. Also, we found transposase genes and CRISPR arrays that suggest multiple encounters with foreign DNA. Presence of genomic exchange traits was widespread and abundant in the genus, suggesting a role in genomic evolution. The high genetic variability and indications of genetic exchange make it difficult to elucidate genome evolutionary paths and raise the awareness of the roles of foreign DNA in the genomic evolution of environmental organisms.",2017,"photobacterium; vibrionaceae; comparative genomics; pan-genome; core-genome","Article","ISI"

Marine mussels of the Mytilus edulis species complex provide a good model to study mechanisms underlying species formation. They hybridise extensively at many localities and both pre- and postzygotic isolating mechanisms may be operating. Mussels have external fertilisation and sperm cells should show specific adaptations for survival and successful fertilisation. Sperm thus represent key targets in investigations of the molecular mechanisms underlying reproductive isolation. We undertook a deep transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) of mature male gonads and a 2DE/MS-based proteome analysis of sperm from Mytilus edulis and M. galloprovincialis raised in a common environment. We provide evidence of extensive expression differences between the two mussel species, and general agreement between the transcriptomic and proteomic results in the direction of expression differences between species. Differential expression is marked for mitochondrial genes and for those involved in spermatogenesis, sperm motility, sperm-egg interactions, the acrosome reaction, sperm capacitation, ATP reserves and ROS production. Proteins and their corresponding genes might thus be good targets in further genomic analysis of reproductive barriers between these closely related species. Significance: Model systems for the study of fertilization include marine invertebrates with external fertilisation, such as abalones, sea urchins and mussels, because of the ease with which large quantities of gametes released into seawater can be collected after induced spawning. Unlike abalones and sea urchins, hybridisation has been reported between mussels of different Mytilus spp., which thus makes them very appealing for the study of reproductive isolation at both pre- and postzygotic levels. There is a lack of empirical proteomic studies on sperm samples comparing different Mytilus species, which could help to advance this study. A comparative analysis of sperm proteomes across different taxa may provide important insights into the fundamental molecular processes and mechanisms involved in reproductive isolation. It might also contribute to a better understanding of sperm function and of the adaptive evolution of sperm proteins in different taxa. There is now growing evidence from genomics studies that multiple protein complexes and many individual proteins might have important functions in sperm biology and the fertilisation process. From an applied perspective, the identification of sperm-specific proteins could also contribute to the improved understanding of fertility problems and as targets for fertility control.",2019,"sperm; gonad; external fertilisation; marine invertebrates; reproductive isolation; speciation; proteomics; transcriptomics","Article","ISI"
"Galapagos Islands Endemic Vertebrates: A Population Genetics Perspective","10.1093/jhered/esy066","Hedrick, PW","The organisms of the Galapagos Islands played a central role in the development of the theory of evolution by Charles Darwin. Examination of the population genetics factors of many of these organisms with modern molecular methods has expanded our understanding of their evolution. Here, I provide a perspective on how selection, gene flow, genetic drift, mutation, and inbreeding have contributed to the evolution of 6 iconic Galapagos species: flightless cormorant, pink iguana, marine iguana, Galapagos hawk, giant tortoises, and Darwin's finches. Because of the inherent biological differences among these species that have colonized the Galapagos, different population genetic factors appear to be more or less important in these different species. For example, the Galapagos provided novel environments in which strong selection took place and the Darwin's finches diversified to produce new species and the cormorant adapted to the nutrient-rich western shores of the Galapagos by losing its ability to fly and genomic data have now identified candidate genes. In both the pink iguana, which exists in one small population, and the Galapagos hawk, which has small population sizes, genetic drift has been potentially quite important. There appears to be very limited interisland gene flow in the flightless cormorant and the Galapagos hawk. On the other hand, both the marine iguana and some of the Darwin's finches appear to have significant interisland gene flow. Hybridization between species and subspecies has also introduced new adaptive variation, and in some cases, hybridization might have resulted in despeciation. Overall, new population genetics and genomics research has provided additional insight into the evolution of vertebrate species in the Galapagos.",2019,"gene flow; genetic drift; hybridization; inbreeding; selection","Article","ISI"

However, the distribution and functional diversity of CRISPRs among environmental bacteria remains largely unknown. Here, comparative genomics of 75 Salinispora strains provided insight into the diversity and distribution of CRISPR-Cas systems in a cosmopolitan marine actinomycete genus. Results: CRISPRs were found in all Salinispora strains, with the majority containing multiple loci and different Cas array subtypes. Of the six subtypes identified, three have not been previously described. A lower prophage frequency in S. arenicola was associated with a higher fraction of spacers matching Salinispora prophages compared to S. tropica, suggesting differing defensive capacities between Salinispora species. The occurrence of related prophages in strains from distant locations, as well as spacers matching those prophages inserted throughout spacer arrays, indicate recurring encounters with widely distributed phages over time. Linkages of CRISPR features with Salinispora microdiversity pointed to subclade-specific contacts with mobile genetic elements (MGEs). This included lineage-specific spacer deletions or insertions, which may reflect weak selective pressures to maintain immunity or distinct temporal interactions with MGEs, respectively. Biogeographic patterns in spacer and prophage distributions support the concept that Salinispora spp. encounter localized MGEs. Moreover, the presence of spacers matching housekeeping genes suggests that CRISPRs may have functions outside of viral defense. Conclusions: This study provides a comprehensive examination of CRISPR-Cas systems in a broadly distributed group of environmental bacteria. The ubiquity and diversity of CRISPRs in Salinispora suggests that CRISPR-mediated interactions with MGEs represent a major force in the ecology and evolution of this cosmopolitan marine actinomycete genus.",2014,"salinispora; crispr-cas; prophages; mobile genetic elements; immunity; evolution","Article","ISI"

Our analyses focused on a nuclear gene (atp5cl) that was previously detected in an F-ST scan as highly structured among populations separated by the Finistere Peninsula in France. This gene encodes the gamma subunit of the F-o/F-1 ATP synthase, a multiprotein complex that is paramount to cellular respiration and energy production. Analysis of non-synonymous to synonymous mutation ratios revealed that 65% of the gene is highly conserved (dN/dS <= 0.1, min= 0), while 6% of the gene is likely under positive selection (dN/dS >= 1, max = 2.03). All replacement mutations are clustered on a 46 residues portion of the protein, within an inter-peptide interaction zone. Comparative genomics suggests that these mutations are evolutionarily stable, and we hypothesize that they are involved in inter-population genetic incompatibilities with other subunits of the ATP synthase complex. The protein stability of the gamma subunit conferred by southern variants was inferred to be higher under warmer temperatures, suggesting that environmental conditions may contribute to the strength of genetic barriers in L. balthica.",2019,"molecular evolution; local adaptation; genetic incompatibilities; selection; atp synthase; macoma balthica","Article","ISI"

Most outliers were watershed-specific, but genomic regions undergoing parallel genetic changes in multiple watersheds were also identified. Interestingly, several of the stream-lake outlier regions match those previously identified in marine-freshwater and benthic-limnetic genome scans, indicating reuse of the same genetic loci in different adaptive scenarios.

Evolutionary conservation (as defined here) is concerned with preserving the raw materials for generating future biodiversity. All 3 domains can be documented with genetic case histories in the waters of the Hawaiian Archipelago, an isolated chain of volcanic islands with 2 types of biodiversity: colonists, and new species that arose from colonists. This review demonstrates that 1) phylogenetic studies have identified previously unknown branches in the tree of life that are endemic to Hawaiian waters; 2) population genetic surveys define isolated marine ecosystems as management units, and 3) phylogeographic analyses illustrate the pathways of colonization that can enhance future biodiversity.

This is especially important in the context of new practices in agriculture that have arisen to tackle the challenges of global food security, including the rising number of marine and freshwater species that are used in aquaculture. In this study, we demonstrate the utility of combining evolutionary approaches with bioinformatics to mine non-viral genome data for viruses, by adapting methods from paleovirology. We report the discovery of a new lineage of dsDNA viruses that are associated with at least fifteen different species of fish. This approach also enabled us to simultaneously identify sequences that likely represent endogenous viral elements, which we experimentally confirmed in commercial salmon samples.

However, divergence can still occur despite gene flow if strong selection acts on populations occupying different ecological niches.

Previous genetic analyses revealed two sympatric lineages associated with different coral hosts. In this study, we examined the mechanisms promoting and maintaining the snails' adaptation to their coral hosts. Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from type II restriction site-associated DNA (2b-RAD) sequencing revealed two differentiated clusters of C. violacea that were largely concordant with coral host, consistent with previous genetic results. However, the presence of some admixed genotypes indicates gene flow from one lineage to the other. Combined, these results suggest that differentiation between host-associated lineages of C. violacea is occurring in the face of ongoing gene flow, requiring strong selection. Indeed, 2.7% of all SNP loci were outlier loci (73/2,718), indicative of divergence with gene flow, driven by adaptation of each C. violacea lineage to their specific coral hosts.",2020,"adaptation; coral reefs; ecological divergence; gastropods; population genomics; rad-seq","Article","ISI"

Our analyses showed the presence of at least 15 cryptic species and suggest the existence of incomplete lineage sorting or introgression between five of them. These results suggested the possible existence of different levels of reproductive barriers within this species complex. We also detected differences among species in their phylogeographic patterns, range and depth distributions, which may suggest different biogeographic histories (e.g., endemic species or recent introductions).",2017,"barcode; brown alga; coi-5p; cryptic species; ectocarpus; hybridization; introgression; its1; species delimitation","Article","ISI"

While -omics technologies such as genomics, transcriptoinics, and proteomics measure the metabolic potential of organisms, metabolomics provides detailed information on the organic compounds produced during metabolism and found within cells and in the environment. Improvements in analytical techniques have expanded our understanding of metabolomics and developments in computational tools have made metabolomics data accessible to a broad segment of the scientific community. Yet, metabolomics methods have only been applied to a limited number of projects in the marine environment. Here, we review analysis techniques for mass spectrometry data and summarize the current state of metabolomics databases. We then describe a boutique database developed in our laboratory for efficient data analysis and selection of mass spectral targets for metabolite identification. The code to implement the database is freely available on GitHub (https://github.com/joefutrelle/domdb). Data organization and analysis are critical, but often under-appreciated, components of metabolomics research. Future advances in environmental metabolomics will take advantage of continued development of new tools that facilitate analysis of large metabolomics datasets. (C) 2015 The Authors.

"Rhodococcus comparative genomics reveals a phylogenomic-dependent non- ribosomal peptide synthetase distribution: insights into biosynthetic gene cluster connection to an orphan metabolite","10.1099/mgen.0.000621","Undabarrena, A; Valencia, R; Cumsille, A; Zamora-Leiva, L; Castro-Nallar, E; Barona-Gomez, F; Camara, B","Natural products (NPs) are synthesized by biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), whose genes are involved in producing one or a family of chemically related metabolites. Advances in comparative genomics have been favourable for exploiting huge amounts of data and discovering previously unknown BGCs. Nonetheless, studying distribution patterns of novel BGCs and elucidat-ing the biosynthesis of orphan metabolites remains a challenge. To fill this knowledge gap, our study developed a pipeline for high-quality comparative genomics for the actinomycete genus Rhodococcus, which is metabolically versatile, yet under-studied in terms of NPs, leading to a total of 110 genomes, 1891 BGCs and 717 non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Phylogenomic inferences showed four major clades retrieved from strains of several ecological habitats. BiG- SCAPE sequence similarity BGC networking revealed 44 unidentified gene cluster families (GCFs) for NRPS, which presented a phylogenomic-dependent evolution pattern, supporting the hypothesis of vertical gene transfer. As a proof of concept, we analysed in- depth one of our marine strains, Rhodococcus sp. H- CA8f, which revealed a unique BGC distribution within its phylogenomic clade, involved in producing a chloramphenicol-related compound. While this BGC is part of the most abundant and widely distributed NRPS GCF, CORASON analysis unveiled major differences regarding its genetic context, co-occurrence patterns and modularity. This BGC is composed of three sections, two well- conserved right/left arms flanking a very variable middle section, composed of nrps genes. The presence of two non-canonical domains in H-CA8f's BGC may contribute to adding chemical diversity to this family of NPs. Liquid chromatography- high resolution MS and dereplication efforts retrieved a set of related orphan metabo-lites, the corynecins, which to our knowledge are reported here for the first time in Rhodococcus. Overall, our data provide insights to connect BGC uniqueness with orphan metabolites, by revealing key comparative genomic features supported by models of BGC distribution along phylogeny.",2021,"biosynthetic gene clusters; comparative genomics; non-ribosomal peptide synthetase evolution; orphan metabolites; rhodococcus","Article","ISI"
"Genome Size Dynamics in Marine Ribbon Worms (Nemertea, Spiralia)","10.3390/genes12091347","Paule, J; von Dohren, J; Sagorny, C; Nilsson, MA","Nemertea is a phylum consisting of 1300 mostly marine species. Nemertea is distinguished by an eversible muscular proboscis, and most of the species are venomous. Genomic resources for this phylum are scarce despite their value in understanding biodiversity. Here, we present genome size estimates of Nemertea based on flow cytometry and their relationship to different morphological and developmental traits. Ancestral genome size estimations were done across the nemertean phylogeny. The results increase the available genome size estimates for Nemertea three-fold. Our analyses show that Nemertea has a narrow genome size range (0.43-3.89 pg) compared to other phyla in Lophotrochozoa. A relationship between genome size and evolutionary rate, developmental modes, and habitat was found. Trait analyses show that the highest evolutionary rate of genome size is found in upper intertidal, viviparous species with direct development. Despite previous findings, body size in nemerteans was not correlated with genome size. A relatively small genome (1.18 pg) is assumed for the most recent common ancestor of all extant nemerteans. The results provide an important basis for future studies in nemertean genomics, which will be instrumental to understanding the evolution of this enigmatic and often neglected phylum.",2021,"c-value; genome size; flow cytometry; habitat; life history; ribbon worm; nemertea; lophotrochozoa; evolution; taxonomy","Article","ISI"

In addition to CSL, OtHV1 has also been found in association with carcinoma in South American fur seals (Arctocephalus australis), demonstrating it can infect related species. Northern fur seals (NFS, Callorhinus ursinus) are sympatric with CSL, and copulation between these species has been observed; yet, there are no reports of urogenital carcinoma in NFS. We describe a new Otarine herpesvirus found in vaginal swabs from NFS, herein called OtHV4. Partial sequencing of the polymerase gene and the glycoprotein B gene revealed OtHV4 is closely related to OtHV1, with 95% homology in the region of polymerase sequenced, and phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that they are sister taxa. An OtHV4-specific hydrolysis probe quantitative PCR was developed and validated, and its use on vaginal swabs revealed 16 of 50 (32%) wild adult female NFS were positive for OtHV4.

How these conditions impact biotic interactions and evolutionary processes is largely unknown. Here we employed single cell genomics to analyze cell-to-cell genome content variability and signatures of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and viral infections in five cells of Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator, which were collected from a 3 km-deep fracture water in the 2.9 Ga-old Witwatersrand Basin of South Africa. Between 0 and 32% of genes recovered from single cells were not present in the original, metagenomic assembly of Desulforudis, which was obtained from a neighboring subsurface fracture. We found a transposable prophage, a retron, multiple clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) and restriction-modification systems, and an unusually high frequency of transposases in the analyzed single cell genomes. This indicates that recombination, HGT and viral infections are prevalent evolutionary events in the studied population of microorganisms inhabiting a highly stable deep subsurface environment.",2015,"single cell genomics; desulforudis; evolution; horizontal gene transfer (hgt); transposases; transposable phages; population genomics; terrestrial deep subsurface","Article","ISI"

To catch up with digitization of genetic resources, scientists need to join with all relevant stakeholders and design new global governance mechanisms for digital sequence information. We propose the establishment of a Multi-stakeholder Committee on the Governance of Digital Sequence Information (DSI). This multi-disciplinary body will be dedicated to mitigate governance issues associated with the digitization of genetic resources. Solving the DSI conundrum is sorely needed given the forthcoming multilateral meetings of the Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS) framework (the next CBD COP is scheduled in 2021) that are central to tackle the global loss of biodiversity, global warming, pandemic risk and food insecurity. Contemporary research is increasingly data-centric and the rise of genomics revolutionized our approach and use of genetic resources. However, genomics developed relatively independently from the international instruments on the conservation of biological diversity, in particular the Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS) framework. The legal and political status of Digital Sequence Information (DSI) derived from genetic resources emerged recently as a contentious point in the various ABS instruments dealing with genetic resources. In view of the multiple parallel and uncoordinated debates that occurred in various forums dealing with plants, animals, terrestrial, microbial, marine and agricultural biodiversity, we propose here to take a step back in the discussion. We argue that DSI should be considered as an overarching issue to be addressed through a coordinated and inclusive Multi-stakeholder Committee that would assess its position and role within the existing ABS regime complex. This Multi-stakeholder Committee on the Governance of Digital Sequence Information, that may run under the auspices of the United Nations, will be dedicated to mitigate global governance issues associated with the digitization of genetic resources.

"Transcriptomic and proteomic effects of a neonicotinoid insecticide mixture in the marine mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis, Lam.)","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.03.040","Dondero, F; Negri, A; Boatti, L; Marsano, F; Mignone, F; Viarengo, A","Background: Imidacloprid and Thiacloprid are two neonicotinoid insecticides whose use have been raising exponentially. Both act selectively as agonist of the insect nicotinic-Acetylcholine Receptor (nAChR) and therefore, by definition, they hold the same mode of action. Notwithstanding the growing attention to the ecotoxicological effects of neonicotinoids, there is a lack of information on their toxicodynamics and their mixture effects, in particular, in aquatic organisms. Objectives: The main objectives of this work were: (i) assess sublethal effects of two neonicotinoids- Imidacloprid and Thiacloprid-in the tissues of the marine mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis Lam.); (ii) identify the molecular dynamics elicited by the two chemicals through gene/protein expression profiling and a functional genomics approach; (iii) assess the effects of a neonicotinoid binary mixture. Methods: Sublethal effects were measured by means of digestive gland lysosomal membrane stability (LMS) and gill acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. Gene expression profiles were evaluated in the digestive gland using a 1.7 K cDNA microarray and quantitative-PCR (Q-PCR). Proteome profiling was performed by means of two-dimensional electrophoresis of digestive gland cytosolic proteins. Functional genomics was based on the over-representation of Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Results and discussion: Our results showed that (i) biomarkers responded in the micromolar range; (ii) Imidacloprid and Thiacloprid elicited distinct toxicodynamics as depicted by the different transcriptomic and proteomic profiles and the opposite trend of AChE activity: (iii) at biomarkers level, the joint effects of the two chemicals appeared to fulfill the principle of independence, but this was less evident at molecular level where a novel specific molecular signature took place. Conclusions: These findings imply that different toxicodynamics may occur also as a response of chemicals with the same mode of action. Our results unveil also the incongruousness of the actual concept of pesticide mode of action in the context of ecological risk assessment analysis of chemical mixtures. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

"Comparative genomic analysis reveals the evolution and environmental adaptation strategies of vibrios","10.1186/s12864-018-4531-2","Lin, HY; Yu, M; Wang, XL; Zhang, XH","Background: Vibrios are among the most diverse and ecologically important marine bacteria, which have evolved many characteristics and lifestyles to occupy various niches. The relationship between genome features and environmental adaptation strategies is an essential part for understanding the ecological functions of vibrios in the marine system. The advent of complete genome sequencing technology has provided an important method of examining the genetic characteristics of vibrios on the genomic level. Results: Two Vibrio genomes were sequenced and found to occupy many unique orthologues families which absent from the previously genes pool of the complete genomes of vibrios. Comparative genomics analysis found vibrios encompass a steady core-genome and tremendous pan-genome with substantial gene gain and horizontal gene transfer events in the evolutionary history. Evolutionary analysis based on the core-genome tree suggested that V. fischeri emerged similar to 385 million years ago, along with the occurrence of cephalopods and the flourish of fish. The relatively large genomes, the high number of 16S rRNA gene copies, and the presence of R-M systems and CRISPR system help vibrios live in various marine environments. Chitin-degrading related genes are carried in nearly all the Vibrio genomes. The number of chitinase genes in vibrios has been extremely expanded compared to which in the most recent ancestor of the genus. The chitinase A genes were estimated to have evolved along with the genus, and have undergone significant purifying selective force to conserve the ancestral state. Conclusions: Vibrios have experienced extremely genome expansion events during their evolutionary history, allowing them to develop various functions to spread globally. Despite their close phylogenetic relationships, vibrios were found to have a tremendous pan-genome with a steady core-genome, which indicates the highly plastic genome of the genus. Additionally, the existence of various chitin-degrading related genes and the expansion of chitinase A in the genus demonstrate the importance of the chitin utilization for vibrios. Defensive systems in the Vibrio genomes may protect them from the invasion of external DNA. These genomic features investigated here provide a better knowledge of how the evolutionary process has forged Vibrio genomes to occupy various niches.",2018,"vibrio; comparative genomics; phylogeny; environmental adaptation; gene gain/loss; chitinase","Article","ISI"

The regulatory changes triggered by the temperature shift experienced by this marine pathogen upon entering the human body, are completely unknown. Here we report an RNA-seq approach combined with phenotypical assays to study the response ofPddto cultivation at 37 degrees C in comparison to 25 degrees C. We found that cultivation of aPddhighly virulent strain for fish and mice, RM-71, at 37 degrees C, initially enhanced bacterial growth in comparison to 25 degrees C as evidenced by the increase in optical density. However, cells were found to undergo a progressive loss of viability after 6 h cultivation at 37 degrees C, and no viable cells could be detected from 30 h cultures at 37 degrees C. In contrast, at 25 degrees C, viable cell counts achieved the highest values at 30 h cultivation. Cells grown at 25 degrees C showed normal rod morphology by scanning electron microscopy analysis whereas cells grown at 37 degrees C exhibited chain-like structures and aberrant long shapes suggesting a defect in daughter cell separation and in septum formation. Cells grown at 37 degrees C also exhibited reduced tolerance to benzylpenicillin. Using a RNA-seq approach we discovered that growth at 37 degrees C triggered a heat-shock response, whereas genes involved in motility and virulence were repressed including iron acquisition systems, the type two secretion system, and damselysin toxin, a major virulence factor ofPdd. Human isolates did not exhibit advantage growing at 37 degrees C compared to fish isolates, and comparative genomics did not reveal gene markers specific of human isolates, suggesting that anyPddgenotype existing in the marine environment might potentially cause disease in humans. Altogether, these data indicate that the potential ofPddto cause disease in humans is an accidental condition rather than a selected trait, and that human body temperature constitutes a stressful condition forPdd.This study provides the first transcriptome profile ofPddexposed at human body temperature, and unveils a number of candidate molecular targets for prevention and control of human infections caused by this pathogen.",2020,"photobacterium damselae; zoonosis; temperature; transcriptome; hemolysin; heat-shock response","Article","ISI"

We investigated Baltic Sea sediments with single-cell genomics, metabolomics, metatranscriptomics, and enzyme assays to identify possible subsistence mechanisms employed by uncultured Atribacteria, Aminicenantes, Actinobacteria group OPB41, Aerophobetes, Chloroflexi, Deltaproteobacteria, Desulfatiglans, Bathyarchaeota, and Euryarchaeota marine group II lineages. Some functions appeared to be shared by multiple lineages, such as trehalose production and NAD(+)-consuming deacetylation, both of which have been shown to increase cellular life spans in other organisms by stabilizing proteins and nucleic acids, respectively. Other possible subsistence mechanisms differed between lineages, possibly providing them different physiological niches. Enzyme assays and transcripts suggested that Atribacteria and Actinobacteria group OPB41 catabolized sugars, whereas Aminicenantes and Atribacteria catabolized peptides. Metabolite and transcript data suggested that Atribacteria utilized allantoin, possibly as an energetic substrate or chemical protectant, and also possessed energy-efficient sodium pumps. Atribacteria single-cell amplified genomes (SAGs) recruited transcripts for full pathways for the production of all 20 canonical amino acids, and the gene for amino acid exporter YddG was one of their most highly transcribed genes, suggesting that they may benefit from metabolic interdependence with other cells. Subsistence of uncultured phyla in deep subsurface sediments may occur through shared strategies of using chemical protectants for biomolecular stabilization, but also by differentiating into physiological niches and metabolic interdependencies. IMPORTANCE Much of life on Earth exists in a very slow-growing state, with microbes from deeply buried marine sediments representing an extreme example. These environments are like natural laboratories that have run multi-thousand-year experiments that are impossible to perform in a laboratory. We borrowed some techniques that are commonly used in laboratory experiments and applied them to these natural samples to make hypotheses about how these microbes subsist for so long at low activity. We found that some methods for stabilizing proteins and nucleic acids might be used by many members of the community. We also found evidence for niche differentiation strategies, and possibly cross-feeding, suggesting that even though they are barely growing, complex ecological interactions continue to occur over ultralong timescales.",2019,"deep subsurface; enzyme assays; low energy; marine sediments; metabolomics; metatranscriptomics; single-cell genomics; subsistence","Article","ISI"

To understand the molecular immune mechanisms underlying the response to C. irritans, we first performed a comparative gene transcription analysis using livers from C irritans-immunized L. croceas and from a control group through RNA-Seq technology. After the removal of low-quality sequences and assembly, 51360 contigs were obtained, with an average length of 1066.93 bp. Further, a blast analysis indicates that 30747 contigs can be annotated based on homology with matches in the NT, NR, gene, and string databases. A gene ontology analysis was used to classify 21598 genes according to three major functional categories: molecular function, cellular component, and biological process. Moreover, 14470 genes were found in 303 KEGG pathways. We used RSEM and EdgeR to determine that 3841 genes were significantly differentially expressed (FDR < 0.001), including 2129 up-regulated genes and 1712 down-regulated genes. A significant enrichment analysis of these differentially expressed genes and isogenes revealed major immune related pathways, including the toll-like receptor, complement and coagulation cascades, and chemokine signaling pathways. In addition, 28748 potential simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were detected from 12776 transcripts, and 62992 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in the L. croceas liver transcriptome. This study characterized a gene expression pattern for normal and C irritans-immunized L. croceas for the first time and not only sheds new light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the host-C. irritans interaction but also facilitates future studies on L croceas gene expression and functional genomics.

Abundance, production and respiration of prokaryotes reflect supplies of particulate and dissolved organic matter to the bathypelagic zone. Better resolution of carbon fluxes mediated by deep microbes requires further testing on the validity of conversion factors. Archaea, especially marine Crenarchaeota Group I, are abundant in deep waters where they can fix dissolved inorganic carbon. Viruses appear to be important in the microbial loop in deep waters, displaying remarkably high virus to prokaryote abundance ratios in some oceanic regions. Sequencing of 18S rRNA genes revealed a tremendous diversity of small-sized protists in bathypelagic waters. Abundances of heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) and ciliates decrease with depth more steeply than prokaryotes; nonetheless, data indicated that HNF consumed half of prokaryote production in the bathypelagic zone. Aggregates are important habitats for deep-water microbes, which produce more extracellular enzymes (on a per-cell basis) than surface communities. The theory of marine gel formation provides a framework to unravel complex interactions between microbes and organic polymers. Recent data on the effects of hydrostatic pressure on microbial activities indicate that bathypelagic microbial activity is generally higher under in situ pressure conditions than at atmospheric pressures. High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes revealed a remarkable diversity of Bacteria in the bathypelagic ocean. Metagenomics and comparative genomics of piezophiles reveal not only the high diversity of deep sea microbes but also specific functional attributes of these piezophilic microbes, interpreted as an adaptation to the deep water environment. Taken together, the data compiled on bathypelagic microbes indicate that, despite high-pressure and low-temperature conditions, microbes in the bathypelagic ocean dynamically interact with complex mixtures of organic matter, responding to changes in the ocean's biogeochemical state.

"Carbon Fixation by Marine Ultrasmall Prokaryotes","10.1093/gbe/evz050","Lannes, R; Olsson-Francis, K; Lopez, P; Bapteste, E","Autotrophic carbon fixation is a crucial process for sustaining life on Earth. To date, six pathways, the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle, the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle, the 3-hydroxypropionate bi-cycle, the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, the dicarboxylate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle, and the 4-hydroxybutyrate cycle, have been described. Nano-organisms such as members of the Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) bacterial superphylum and the Diapherotrites, Parvarchaeota, Aenigmarchaeota, Nanoarchaeota, Nanohalorchaeota (DPANN) archaeal superphylum could deeply impact carbon cycling and carbon fixation in ways that are still to be determined. CPR and DPANN are ubiquitous in the environment but understudied; their gene contents are not exhaustively described; and their metabolisms are not yet fully understood. Here, the completeness of each of the above pathways was quantified and tested for the presence of all key enzymes in nano-organisms from across the World Ocean. The novel marine ultrasmall prokaryotes were demonstrated to collectively harbor the genes required for carbon fixation, in particular the energetically efficient dicarboxylate/4-hydroxybutyrate pathway and the 4-hydroxybutyrate pathway. This contrasted with the known carbon metabolic pathways associated with CPR members in aquifers, where they are described as degraders (Castelle CJ, et al. 2015.

Despite the temporal dominance of bloom formers many algal species can co-exist and compete for nutrients and space, creating a complex and diverse community. While microscopy and single cell genomics can address the taxonomic inventory, the cellular metabolome has yet to be thoroughly explored to determine the physiological status of microalgae. This might, however, provide a key to understand the observed species diversity in the homogeneous environment. Here, we introduce an effective, rapid and versatile method to analyze living single cells from aqueous substrata with laser-desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI-MS) using a simple and inexpensive matrix-free support. The cells deposited on a cultivation-medium wetted support are analyzed with minimal disturbance as they remain in their natural viable state until their disruption during LDI-MS. Metabolites desorbed from single cells are analyzed on High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HR-MS) using the Orbitrap FT-MS technology to fingerprint cellular chemistry. This live single-cell mass spectrometry (LSC-MS) allows assessing the physiological status and strain-specifics of different microalgae, including marine diatoms and freshwater chlorophytes, at the single-cell level. We further report a reliable and robust data treatment pipeline to perform multivariate statistics on the replicated LSC-MS data. Comparing single cell MS spectra from natural phytoplankton samples and from laboratory strains allows the identification and discrimination of inter and intra-specific metabolic variability and thereby has promising applications in addressing highly complex phytoplankton communities. Notably, the herein described matrix-free live-single-cell LDI-HR-MS approach enables monitoring dynamics of the plankton and might explain why key-players survive, thrive, avoid selective feeding or pathogenic virus and bacteria, while others are overcome and die.",2019,"microalgae; single-cell metabolomics; live single cell mass spectrometry; matrix-free laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry; multivariate statistics; diatoms coscinodiscus (bacillariophyceae); chlorophyceae haematococcus pluvialis","Article","ISI"

Yet, little is known about its solitary, non-colonial cell stages or its distribution during the colder, low-productivity seasons. We examined the biogeography ofPhaeocystisalong a high-resolution (0.5-degree latitudinal interval) transect from the Antarctic ice-edge to the equator of the South Pacific, in the austral autumn-winter. Using high-throughput 18S rRNA gene sequences with single nucleotide variable (zero-radius) operational taxonomic units (zOTUs) allowed us to explore the possibility of strain-level variation. From water samples within the upper water column, we show the presence of an abundantPhaeocystisassemblage that persisted during the colder months, contributing up to 9% of the microbial eukaryote community at high latitudes. The biogeography ofPhaeocystiswas strongly shaped by oceanographic boundaries, most prominently the polar and subantarctic fronts. Marked changes in dominantPhaeocystis antarcticazOTUs between different frontal zones support the concept that ecotypes may exist within thePhaeocystisassemblage. Our findings also show that thePhaeocystisassemblage did not abide by the classical latitudinal diversity gradient of increasing richness from the poles to the tropics; richness peaked at 30 degrees S and declined to a minimum at 5 degrees S.

"The polychaete, Perinereis nuntia ESTs and its use to uncover potential biomarker genes for molecular ecotoxicological studies","10.1016/j.envres.2011.09.012","Rhee, JS; Won, EJ; Kim, RO; Choi, BS; Choi, IY; Park, GS; Shin, KH; Lee, YM; Lee, JS","The polychaete, Perinereis nuntia, has been used as an indicator species to assess the environmental condition of benthic communities in coastal marine environments. Recently, high-throughput sequencing technology has been proven to be a useful method for analyzing expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in non-model species. Thus, we have obtained extensive cDNA information by the pyrosequencing method, to utilize the polychaete species as a test organism for sediment quality monitoring studies. From the total RNA of P. nuntia, cDNA was reversely synthesized and randomly sequenced using a GS-FLX sequencer. In the assembly stage 1, 40,379 transcripts (13,666 contigs and 26,713 singletons) were acquired and showed 47% hitting rate compared with the GenBank non-redundant (NR) amino acid sequence database using BLASTX. After the stage-2 assembly, 21,657 transcripts were identified and showed 28% hitting rate. Finally, we obtained 6 064 unigenes that corresponded to the GenBank NR amino acid sequence database using BLASTX. Of the transcripts obtained in this species, we found a number of stress- and cell defense-related genes (e.g. heat shock protein family, antioxidant-related genes, cytochrome P450 genes) that are potentially useful for sediment monitoring at the molecular level, indicating that the pyrosequencing method is an effective approach to uncover gene families of potential biomarker genes simultaneously, and thus make transcriptomic studies possible. To confirm the usefulness of those potential biomarker genes, we analyzed the comparative profiling of P. nuntia mRNA transcripts between the samples collected from the polychaete aquaculture farm and the southern coast field of South Korea. In this paper, we summarize the expressed cDNA information of P. nuntia and discussed its potential use in environmental genomics and ecotoxicological studies for uncovering the potential molecular mechanisms of environmental stresses and chemical toxicity to the indicator species, P. nuntia in marine sediments.

"Comparative Genomics and Environmental Distribution of Large dsDNA Viruses in the Family Asfarviridae","10.3389/fmicb.2021.657471","Karki, S; Moniruzzaman, M; Aylward, FO","The family Asfarviridae is a group of nucleo-cytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs) of which African swine fever virus (ASFV) is well-characterized. Recently the discovery of several Asfarviridae members other than ASFV has suggested that this family represents a diverse and cosmopolitan group of viruses, but the genomics and distribution of this family have not been studied in detail. To this end we analyzed five complete genomes and 35 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of viruses from this family to shed light on their evolutionary relationships and environmental distribution. The Asfarvirus MAGs derive from diverse marine, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats, underscoring the broad environmental distribution of this family. We present phylogenetic analyses using conserved marker genes and whole-genome comparison of pairwise average amino acid identity (AAI) values, revealing a high level of genomic divergence across disparate Asfarviruses. Further, we found that Asfarviridae genomes encode genes with diverse predicted metabolic roles and detectable sequence homology to proteins in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, highlighting the genomic chimerism that is a salient feature of NCLDV. Our read mapping from Tara oceans metagenomic data also revealed that three Asfarviridae MAGs were present in multiple marine samples, indicating that they are widespread in the ocean. In one of these MAGs we identified four marker genes with > 95% AAI to genes sequenced from a virus that infects the dinoflagellate Heterocapsa circularisquama (HcDNAV). This suggests a potential host for this MAG, which would thereby represent a reference genome of a dinoflagellate-infecting giant virus. Together, these results show that Asfarviridae are ubiquitous, comprise similar sequence divergence as other NCLDV families, and include several members that are widespread in the ocean and potentially infect ecologically important protists.",2021,"asfarviridae; ncldv; megavirales; eukaryotic viruses; nucleocytoviricota","Article","ISI"
"Whole genome genotyping reveals discrete genetic diversity in north-east Atlantic maerl beds","10.1111/eva.13219","Jenkins, TL; Guillemin, ML; Simon-Nutbrown, C; Burdett, HL; Stevens, JR; Pena, V","Maerl beds are vital habitats for a diverse array of marine species across trophic levels, but they are increasingly threatened by human activities and climate change. Furthermore, little is known about the genetic diversity of maerl-forming species and the population structure of maerl beds, both of which are important for understanding the ability of these species to adapt to changing environments and for informing marine reserve planning. In this study, we used a whole genome genotyping approach to explore the population genomics of Phymatolithon calcareum, a maerl-forming red algal species, whose geographical distribution spans the north-east Atlantic, from Norway to Portugal. Our results, using 14,150 genome-wide SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms), showed that P. calcareum maerl beds across the north-east Atlantic are generally structured geographically, a pattern likely explained by low dispersal potential and limited connectivity between regions. Additionally, we found that P. calcareum from the Fal Estuary, south-west England, is genetically distinct from all other P. calcareum sampled, even from The Manacles, a site located only 13 km away. Further analysis revealed that this finding is not the result of introgression from two closely related species, Phymatolithon purpureum or Lithothamnion corallioides. Instead, this unique diversity may have been shaped over time by geographical isolation of the Fal Estuary maerl bed and a lack of gene flow with other P. calcareum populations. The genomic data presented in this study suggest that P. calcareum genetic diversity has accumulated over large temporal and spatial scales, the preservation of which will be important for maximizing the resilience of this species to changes in climate and the environment. Moreover, our findings underline the importance of managing the conservation of maerl beds across western Europe as distinct units, at a site-by-site level.",2021,"conservation management; coralline algae; maerl; mitogenome; plastome; population genetic structure; rhodolith; single nucleotide polymorphism","Article","ISI"
"Genome-wide analysis of natural and restored eastern oyster populations reveals local adaptation and positive impacts of planting frequency and broodstock number","10.1111/eva.13322","Hornick, KM; Plough, LV","The release of captive-bred plants and animals has increased worldwide to augment declining species. However, insufficient attention has been given to understanding how neutral and adaptive genetic variation are partitioned within and among proximal natural populations, and the patterns and drivers of gene flow over small spatial scales, which can be important for restoration success. A seascape genomics approach was used to investigate population structure, local adaptation, and the extent to which environmental gradients influence genetic variation among natural and restored populations of Chesapeake Bay eastern oysters Crassostrea virginica. We also investigated the impact of hatchery practices on neutral genetic diversity of restored reefs and quantified the broader genetic impacts of large-scale hatchery-based bivalve restoration. Restored reefs showed similar levels of diversity as natural reefs, and striking relationships were found between planting frequency and broodstock numbers and genetic diversity metrics (effective population size and relatedness), suggesting that hatchery practices can have a major impact on diversity. Despite long-term restoration activities, haphazard historical translocations, and high dispersal potential of larvae that could homogenize allele frequencies among populations, moderate neutral population genetic structure was uncovered. Moreover, environmental factors, namely salinity, pH, and temperature, play a major role in the distribution of neutral and adaptive genetic variation. For marine invertebrates in heterogeneous seascapes, collecting broodstock from large populations experiencing similar environments to candidate sites may provide the most appropriate sources for restoration and ensure population resilience in the face of rapid environmental change. This is one of a few studies to demonstrate empirically that hatchery practices have a major impact on the retention of genetic diversity. Overall, these results contribute to the growing body of evidence for fine-scale genetic structure and local adaptation in broadcast-spawning marine species and provide novel information for the management of an important fisheries resource.",2022,"aquaculture; genomics; hatchery; local adaptation; oyster; radseq; restoration","Article","ISI"

Next-generation sequencing allows for thousands of genomic markers to be analyzed, which provides the resolution needed to address these questions in marine species with weakly differentiated populations. Greenland Halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) is one of the most important exploited demersal species throughout the North Atlantic, in particular in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada. There, two nurseries are known, the St. Lawrence Estuary and the northern Anticosti Island, but their contribution to the renewal of stocks remains unknown. The goals of this study were (a) to document the genetic structure and (b) to estimate the contribution of the different identified breeding stocks to nurseries. We sampled 100 juveniles per nursery and 50 adults from seven sites ranging from Saguenay Fjord to offshore Newfoundland, with some sites sampled over two consecutive years in order to evaluate the temporal stability of the contribution. Our results show that after removing sex-linked markers, the Estuary/Gulf of St. Lawrence represents a single stock which is genetically distinct from the Atlantic around Newfoundland (F-ST = 0.00146, p-value = .001). Population assignment showed that recruitment in both nurseries is predominantly associated with the St. Lawrence stock. However, we found that the relative contribution of both stocks to the nurseries is temporally variable with 1% contribution of the Newfoundland stock one year but up to 33% for the second year, which may be caused by year-to-year variation in larval transport into the Gulf of St. Lawrence. This study serves as a model for the identification of stocks for fisheries resources in a context where few barriers to dispersal occur, in addition to demonstrating the importance of considering sex-linked markers and temporal replicates in studies of population genomics.",2020,"greenland halibut; management; marine genomics; population assignment; stock identification; temporal stability","Article","ISI"
"Genomic signatures of environmental selection despite near-panmixia in summer flounder","10.1111/eva.12676","Hoey, JA; Pinsky, ML","Rapid environmental change is altering the selective pressures experienced by marine species. While adaptation to local environmental conditions depends on a balance between dispersal and natural selection across the seascape, the spatial scale of adaptation and the relative importance of mechanisms maintaining adaptation in the ocean are not well understood. Here, using population assignment tests, Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), and genome scans with double-digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing data, we evaluated population structure and locus-environment associations in a commercially important species, summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus), along the U.S. east coast. Based on 1,137 single nucleotide polymorphisms across 232 individuals spanning nearly 1,900 km, we found no indication of population structure across Cape Hatteras, North Carolina (F-ST=0.0014) or of isolation by distance along the coast using individual relatedness. ABC estimated the probability of dispersal across the biogeographic break at Cape Hatteras to be high (95% credible interval: 7%-50% migration). However, we found 15 loci whose allele frequencies were associated with at least one of four environmental variables. Of those, 11 were correlated with bottom temperature. For summer flounder, our results suggest continued fisheries management as a single population and identify likely response mechanisms to climate change. Broadly speaking, our findings suggest that spatial balancing selection can manifest in adaptive divergence on regional scales in marine fish despite high dispersal, and that these conditions likely result in the widespread distribution of adaptive alleles and a high potential for future genetic adaptation in response to changing environmental conditions. In the context of a rapidly changing world, a landscape genomics perspective offers a useful approach for understanding the causes and consequences of genetic differentiation.",2018,"adaptation; ddradseq; genome scan; population structure; spatial balancing selection; summer flounder","Article","ISI"
"Combining six genome scan methods to detect candidate genes to salinity in the Mediterranean striped red mullet (Mullus surmuletus)","10.1186/s12864-018-4579-z","Dalongeville, A; Benestan, L; Mouillot, D; Lobreaux, S; Manel, S","Background: Adaptive genomics may help predicting how a species will respond to future environmental changes. Genomic signatures of local adaptation in marine organisms are often driven by environmental selective agents impacting the physiology of organisms. With one of the highest salinity level, the Mediterranean Sea provides an excellent model to investigate adaptive genomic divergence underlying salinity adaptation. In the present study, we combined six genome scan methods to detect potential genomic signal of selection in the striped red mullet (Mullus surmuletus) populations distributed across a wide salinity gradient. We then blasted these outlier sequences on published fish genomic resources in order to identify relevant potential candidate genes for salinity adaptation in this species. Results: Altogether, the six genome scan methods found 173 outliers out of 1153 SNPs. Using a blast approach, we discovered four candidate SNPs belonging to three genes potentially implicated in adaptation of M. surmuletus to salinity. The allele frequency at one of these SNPs significantly increases with salinity independently from the effect of longitude. The gene associated to this SNP, SOCS2, encodes for an inhibitor of cytokine and has previously been shown to be expressed under osmotic pressure in other marine organisms. Additionally, our results showed that genome scan methods not correcting for spatial structure can still be an efficient strategy to detect potential footprints of selection, when the spatial and environmental variation are confounded, and then, correcting for spatial structure in a second step represents a conservative method. Conclusion: The present outcomes bring evidences of potential genomic footprint of selection, which suggest an adaptive response of M. surmuletus to salinity conditions in the Mediterranean Sea. Additional genomic data such as sequencing of a full-genome and transcriptome analyses of gene expression would provide new insights regarding the possibility that some striped red mullet populations are locally adapted to their saline environment.",2018,"adaptive genomics; genome scan; candidate genes; mediterranean sea; mullus surmuletus; salinity","Article","ISI"

The edible cockle (Cerastoderma edule) is a marine bivalve distributed along the Northeast Atlantic coast of Europe and is an important resource from both commercial and ecological perspectives. We performed a population genomics screening using 2b-RAD genotyping on 9309 SNPs localized in the cockle's genome on a sample of 536 specimens pertaining to 14 beds in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean to analyse the genetic structure with regard to environmental variables. Larval dispersal modelling considering species behaviour and interannual/interseasonal variation in ocean conditions was carried out as an essential background to which compare genetic information. Cockle populations in the Northeast Atlantic displayed low but significant geographical differentiation between populations (F-ST = 0.0240; p < 0.001), albeit not across generations. We identified 742 and 36 outlier SNPs related to divergent and balancing selection in all the geographical scenarios inspected, and sea temperature and salinity were the main environmental correlates suggested. Highly significant linkage disequilibrium was detected at specific genomic regions against the very low values observed across the whole genome. Two main genetic groups were identified, northwards and southwards of French Brittany. Larval dispersal modelling suggested a barrier for larval dispersal linked to the Ushant front that could explain these two genetic clusters. Further genetic subdivision was observed using outlier loci and considering larval advection. The northern group was divided into the Irish/Celtic Seas and the English Channel/North Sea, while the southern group was divided into three subgroups. This information represents the baseline for the management of cockles, designing conservation strategies, founding broodstock for depleted beds and producing suitable seed for aquaculture production.",2022,"2b-rad; adaptive variation; fisheries management; genetic structure; larval dispersal modelling","Article","ISI"

The main goal of this study was to assess how a population genomics framework could help delineate the genetic structure of the American lobster (Homarus americanus) throughout much of the species' range and increase the assignment success of individuals to their location of origin. We genotyped 10156 filtered SNPs using RAD sequencing to delineate genetic structure and perform population assignment for 586 American lobsters collected in 17 locations distributed across a large portion of the species' natural distribution range. Our results revealed the existence of a hierarchical genetic structure, first separating lobsters from the northern and southern part of the range (F-CT=0.0011; P-value=0.0002) and then revealing a total of 11 genetically distinguishable populations (mean F-ST=0.00185; CI: 0.0007-0.0021, P-value<0.0002), providing strong evidence for weak, albeit fine-scale population structuring within each region. A resampling procedure showed that assignment success was highest with a subset of 3000 SNPs having the highest F-ST. Applying Anderson's (Molecular Ecology Resources, 2010, 10, 701) method to avoid high-grading bias', 94.2% and 80.8% of individuals were correctly assigned to their region and location of origin, respectively. Lastly, we showed that assignment success was positively associated with sample size. These results demonstrate that using a large number of SNPs improves fine-scale population structure delineation and population assignment success in a context of weak genetic structure.

Currently, no software exists that utilizes both paired-end reads from RADseq data to efficiently produce population-informative variant calls, especially for non-model organisms with large effective population sizes and high levels of genetic polymorphism. dDocent is an analysis pipeline with a user-friendly, command-line interface designed to process individually barcoded RADseq data (with double cut sites) into informative SNPs/Indels for population-level analyses. The pipeline, written in BASH, uses data reduction techniques and other stand-alone software packages to perform quality trimming and adapter removal, de novo assembly of RAD loci, read mapping, SNP and Indel calling, and baseline data filtering. Double-digest RAD data from population pairings of three different marine fishes were used to compare dDocent with Stacks, the first generally available, widely used pipeline for analysis of RADseq data. dDocent consistently identified more SNPs shared across greater numbers of individuals and with higher levels of coverage. This is due to the fact that dDocent quality trims instead of filtering, incorporates both forward and reverse reads (including reads with INDEL polymorphisms) in assembly, mapping, and SNP calling.

The absence of PcG in both yeast models Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe suggested that polycomb proteins might have evolved together with the emergence of multicellular organisms. However, high throughput sequencing of several microalgal genomes and transcriptomes reveals an unprecedented abundance and diversity of genes encoding the components of these complexes.

They are characterized by particular life history traits, such as a complex social structure and mating system involving sequential hermaphroditism, coupled with an exceptionally long lifespan. Additionally, clownfishes are considered to be one of the rare groups to have experienced an adaptive radiation in the marine environment. Here, we assembled and annotated the first genome of a clownfish species, the tomato clownfish (Amphiprion frenatus). We obtained 17,801 assembled scaffolds, containing a total of 26,917 genes. The completeness of the assembly and annotation was satisfying, with 96.5% of the Actinopterygii Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCOs) being retrieved in A.frenatus assembly. The quality of the resulting assembly is comparable to other bony fish assemblies. This resource is valuable for advancing studies of the particular life history traits of clownfishes, as well as being useful for population genetic studies and the development of new phylogenetic markers. It will also open the way to comparative genomics. Indeed, future genomic comparison among closely related fishes may provide means to identify genes related to the unique adaptations to different sea anemone hosts, as well as better characterize the genomic signatures of an adaptive radiation.",2018,"adaptation; anemonefish; fish; genomics; indo-pacific","Article","ISI"

Here, we present the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of C. japonica, determined by the long-polymerase chain reaction and primer walking sequencing method. The entire genome is 15,738 bp in length, encoding a standard set of 13 protein-coding genes, two ribosomal RNA genes, and 22 transfer RNA genes, plus the putative control region, which is typical for metazoans. The total A+T content of the genome is 69.2%, lower than the other brachyuran crabs except for Callinectes sapidus. The gene order is identical to the published marine brachyurans and differs from the ancestral pancrustacean order by only the position of the tRNA (His) gene. Phylogenetic analyses using the concatenated nucleotide and amino acid sequences of 13 protein-coding genes strongly support the monophyly of Dendrobranchiata and Pleocyemata, which is consistent with the previous taxonomic classification.

In this study, we reported an effective method to inject exogenous materials in H. discus hannai unfertilized eggs. The injected eggs could be fertilized at a ratio of 52.6% +/- 5.9% and hatch at a ratio of 14.6% +/- 1.6%. On the base of this, we further developed an efficient genome editing approach in this species with the transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) technique. Two TALEN pairs targeting the coding sequence of the abalone nodal gene were assembled and tested. While one of the TALEN pairs showed no detectable mutation efficacy, the other one generated mutations in 50% of the targeted loci. The mutation includes small insertions and deletions and base pair replacements like that reported in other species when the TALEN method was applied.

"Population Genomics Insights into Adaptive Evolution and Ecological Differentiation in Streptomycetes","10.1128/AEM.02555-18","Li, YS; Pinto-Tomas, AA; Rong, XY; Cheng, K; Liu, MH; Huang, Y","Deciphering the genomic variation that represents microevolutionary processes toward species divergence is key to understanding microbial speciation, which has long been under debate. Streptomycetes are filamentous bacteria that are ubiquitous in nature and the richest source of antibiotics; however, their speciation processes remain unknown. To tackle this issue, we performed a comprehensive population genomics analysis on Streptomyces albidoflavus residing in different habitats and with a worldwide distribution and identified and characterized the foundational changes within the species. We detected three well-defined phylogenomic clades, of which clades I and III mainly contained free-living (soil/marine) and insect-associated strains, respectively, and Glade II had a mixed origin. By performing genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we identified a number of genetic variants associated with free-living or entomic (denoting or relating to insects) habitats in both the accessory and core genomes. These variants contributed collectively to the population structure and had annotated or confirmed functions that likely facilitate differential adaptation of the species. In addition, we detected higher levels of homologous recombination within each Glade and in the free-living group than within the whole species and in the entomic group. A subset of the insect-associated strains (Glade III) showed a relatively independent evolutionary trajectory with more symbiosis-favorable genes but little genetic interchange with the other lineages. Our results demonstrate that ecological adaptation promotes genetic differentiation in S. albidoflavus, suggesting a model of ecological speciation with gene flow in streptomycetes. IMPORTANCE Species are the fundamental units of ecology and evolution, and speciation leads to the astounding diversity of life on Earth. Studying speciation is thus of great significance to understand, protect, and exploit biodiversity, but it is a challenge in the microbial world. In this study, using population genomics, we placed Streptomyces albidoflavus strains in a spectrum of speciation and showed that the genetic differences between phylogenomic clusters evolved mainly by environmental selection and gene-specific sweeps. These findings highlight the role of ecology in structuring recombining bacterial species, making a step toward a deeper understanding of microbial speciation. Our results also raise concerns of an underrated microbial diversity at the intraspecies level, which can be utilized for mining of ecologically relevant natural products.",2019,"adaptive evolution; ecological differentiation; population genomics; speciation; streptomycetes","Article","ISI"

Current best practice seeks to restore populations by transplanting donor individuals chosen to replicate genetic diversity and structure of extant, nearby populations. However, genetic characteristics are rarely empirically examined across generations, despite their potential role in influencing restoration success. We used genomics to design a restoration program for lost underwater forests ofPhyllospora comosa, a dominant forest-forming macroalga that went locally extinct from reefs off Sydney, Australia. Population genetic diversity and structure of nearby extant populations informed choice of donor sites. We tested whether donor provenance influenced adult transplant survival, condition (via metrics of epibiosis) and the genetic characteristics of recruits at restoration sites. Extant populations ofPhyllosporawithin a 100-km radius of Sydney comprised three distinct genetic clusters with similar levels of genetic diversity. We transplanted reproductive adults from two of these sites, with the aim of restoring fivePhyllosporaforests with levels of genetic structure and diversity similar to donor populations. Donor provenance influenced survival and condition of transplanted adults and recruitment levels varied significantly among restoration sites. Yet, recruitment was rapid and genetic diversity and structure of the F(1)generation resembled extant populations. This likely occurred because transplanted individuals reproduced synchronously and rapidly post-transplantation, prior to mortality of adult donor transplants. Synthesis and applications. As restoration and the need to 'future-proof' marine ecosystems increase globally, it will be critical to understand and harness the role of donor provenance, genetic diversity and structure in restoration success. By incorporating ecological and genomic data into restoration design and assessment, this study demonstrates that evidence-based selection of macroalgal donors can result in F(1)generation recruits with similar levels of genetic diversity and structure as extant populations, despite an effect of provenance on transplant survival and condition. This study also highlights the need for ongoing refinement of transplantation techniques to ensure future recruitment success.",2020,"climate change; genetic diversity; genomics; kelp; marine ecology; restoration; seaweed; snps","Article","ISI"

"Genetic differentiation and signatures of local adaptation revealed by RADseq for a highly dispersive mud crab Scylla olivacea (Herbst, 1796) in the Sulu Sea","10.1002/ece3.7625","Mendiola, MJR; Ravago-Gotanco, R","Connectivity of marine populations is shaped by complex interactions between biological and physical processes across the seascape. The influence of environmental features on the genetic structure of populations has key implications for the dynamics and persistence of populations, and an understanding of spatial scales and patterns of connectivity is crucial for management and conservation. This study employed a seascape genomics approach combining larval dispersal modeling and population genomic analysis using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) obtained from RADseq to examine environmental factors influencing patterns of genetic structure and connectivity for a highly dispersive mud crab Scylla olivacea (Herbst, 1796) in the Sulu Sea. Dispersal simulations reveal widespread but asymmetric larval dispersal influenced by persistent southward and westward surface circulation features in the Sulu Sea. Despite potential for widespread dispersal across the Sulu Sea, significant genetic differentiation was detected among eight populations based on 1,655 SNPs (F-ST = 0.0057, p < .001) and a subset of 1,643 putatively neutral SNP markers (F-ST = 0.0042, p < .001). Oceanography influences genetic structure, with redundancy analysis (RDA) indicating significant contribution of asymmetric ocean currents to neutral genetic variation (Radj2 = 0.133, p = .035). Genetic structure may also reflect demographic factors, with divergent populations characterized by low effective population sizes (N-e < 50). Pronounced latitudinal genetic structure was recovered for loci putatively under selection (F-ST = 0.2390, p < .001), significantly correlated with sea surface temperature variabilities during peak spawning months for S. olivacea (Radj2 = 0.692-0.763; p < .050), suggesting putative signatures of selection and local adaptation to thermal clines. While oceanography and dispersal ability likely shape patterns of gene flow and genetic structure of S. olivacea across the Sulu Sea, the impacts of genetic drift and natural selection influenced by sea surface temperature also appear as likely drivers of population genetic structure. This study contributes to the growing body of literature documenting population genetic structure and local adaptation for highly dispersive marine species, and provides information useful for spatial management of the fishery resource.",2021,"marine connectivity; mud crab; population genomics; rad sequencing; seascape genetics; sulu sea","Article","ISI"

The paucity of genetic information relating to sparids, despite their growing economic value for aquaculture, provides the impetus for exploring the genomics of this fish group. Genomic tool development, such as genetic linkage maps provision, lays the groundwork for linking genotype to phenotype, allowing fine-mapping of loci responsible for beneficial traits. In this study, we applied ddRAD methodology to identify polymorphic markers in a full-sib family of common pandora. Employing the Illumina MiSeq platform, we sampled and sequenced a size-selected genomic fraction of 99 individuals, which led to the identification of 920 polymorphic loci.

The nine-spined stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) is a closely related species of the ecological 'supermodel' three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). It is an emerging model system for evolutionary biology research but has garnered less attention and lacks extensive genomic resources. To expand on these resources and aid the study of sticklebacks in a phylogenetic framework, we characterized nine-spined stickleback transcriptomes from brain and liver using deep sequencing. Results: We obtained nearly eight thousand assembled transcripts, of which 3,091 were assigned as putative one-to-one orthologs to genes found in the three-spined stickleback. These sequences were used for evaluating overall differentiation and substitution rates between nine- and three-spined sticklebacks, and to identify genes that are putatively evolving under positive selection. The synonymous substitution rate was estimated to be 7.1 x 10(-9) per site per year between the two species, and a total of 165 genes showed patterns of adaptive evolution in one or both species. A few nine-spined stickleback contigs lacked an obvious ortholog in three-spined sticklebacks but were found to match genes in other fish species, suggesting several gene losses within 13 million years since the divergence of the two stickleback species. We identified 47 SNPs in 25 different genes that differentiate pond and marine ecotypes. We also identified 468 microsatellites that could be further developed as genetic markers in nine-spined sticklebacks. Conclusion: With deep sequencing of nine-spined stickleback cDNA libraries, our study provides a significant increase in the number of gene sequences and microsatellite markers for this species, and identifies a number of genes showing patterns of adaptive evolution between nine- and three-spined sticklebacks. We also report several candidate genes that might be involved in differential adaptation between marine and freshwater nine-spined sticklebacks.

"Genome Reduction and Microbe-Host Interactions Drive Adaptation of a Sulfur-Oxidizing Bacterium Associated with a Cold Seep Sponge","10.1128/mSystems.00184-16","Tian, RM; Zhang, WP; Cai, L; Wong, YH; Ding, W; Qian, PY","As the most ancient metazoan, sponges have established close relationships with particular microbial symbionts. However, the characteristics and physiology of thioautotrophic symbionts in deep-sea sponges are largely unknown. Using a tailored differential coverage binning method on 22-Gb metagenomic sequences, we recovered the nearly complete genome of a sulfur-oxidizing bacterium (SOB) that dominates the microbiota of the cold seep sponge Suberites sp. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that this bacterium (an unclassified gammaproteobacterium termed Gsub) may represent a new deep-sea SOB group. Microscopic observations suggest that Gsub is probably an extracellular symbiont. Gsub has complete sulfide oxidation and carbon fixation pathways, suggesting a chemoautotrophic lifestyle. Comparative genomics with other sponge-associated SOB and free-living SOB revealed significant genome reduction in Gsub, characterized by the loss of genes for carbohydrate metabolism, motility, DNA repair, and osmotic stress response. Intriguingly, this scenario of genome reduction is highly similar to those of the endosymbionts in deep-sea clams. However, Gsub has retained genes for phage defense and protein secretion, with the latter potentially playing a role in interactions with the sponge host. In addition, we recovered the genome of an ammonia-oxidizing archaeon (AOA), which may carry out ammonia oxidation and carbon fixation within the sponge body. IMPORTANCE Sponges and their symbionts are important players in the biogeochemical cycles of marine environments. As a unique habitat within marine ecosystems, cold seeps have received considerable interest in recent years. This study explores the lifestyle of a new symbiotic SOB in a cold seep sponge. The results demonstrate that both this sponge symbiont and endosymbionts in deep-sea clams employ similar strategies of genome reduction. However, this bacterium has retained unique functions for immunity and defense. Thus, the functional features are determined by both the symbiotic relationship and host type. Moreover, analyses of the genome of an AOA suggest that microbes play different roles in biochemical cycles in the sponge body.

Exiguobacterium can grow in a wide range of temperature, pH, salinity, and heavy-metal concentrations. We characterized Exiguobacterium chiriqhucha strain RW2 isolated from a permanently cold freshwater microbialite in Pavilion Lake, British Columbia using metabolic assays, genomics, comparative genomics, phylogenetics, and fatty acid composition. Strain RW2 has the most extensive growth range for temperature (4-50 degrees C) and pH (5-11) of known Exiguobacterium isolates. Strain RW2 genome predicts pathways for wide differential thermal, cold and osmotic stress using cold and heat shock cascades (e.g., csp and dnaK), choline and betaine uptake/biosynthesis (e.g., opu and proU), antiporters (e.g., arcD and nhaC Na+/K+), membrane fatty acid unsaturation and saturation. Here, we provide the first complete genome from Exiguobacterium chirighucha strain RW2, which was isolated from a freshwater microbialite. Its genome consists of a single 3,019,018 bp circular chromosome encoding over 3,000 predicted proteins, with a GC% content of 52.1%, and no plasmids. In addition to growing at a wide range of temperatures and salinities, our findings indicate that RW2 is resistant to sulfisoxazole and has the genomic potential for detoxification of heavy metals (via mercuric reductases, arsenic resistance pumps, chromate transporters, and cadmium-cobalt-zinc resistance genes), which may contribute to the metabolic potential of Pavilion Lake microbialites. Strain RW2 could also contribute to microbialite formation, as it is a robust biofilm former and encodes genes involved in the deamination of amino acids to ammonia (i.e., L-asparaginase/urease), which could potentially boost carbonate precipitation by lowering the local pH and increasing alkalinity. We also used comparative genomic analysis to predict the pathway for orange pigmentation that is conserved across the entire Exiguobacterium genus, specifically, a C-30 carotenoid biosynthesis pathway is predicted to yield diaponeurosporene-4-oic acid as its final product. Carotenoids have been found to protect against ultraviolet radiation by quenching reactive oxygen, releasing excessive light energy, radical scavenging, and sunscreening.

These cyanobacterial contigs are presumably derived from prey. We also uncovered an associated cyanophage lineage (provisionally named phage PoL_MC2). Phylogenomic analysis of the fragmented genome assembly suggested a minimum genome size of 200Kbp for phage PoL_MC2 that encodes 179 proteins and is most closely related to Synechococcus phage S-SM2. For this phage, gene network analysis demonstrates a highly modular genome structure typical of other cyanophages. Our work demonstrates that SCG is a powerful approach for discovering algal and protist biodiversity and for elucidating biotic interactions in natural samples.",2013,"cyanophage; gene network; horizontal gene transfer; paulinella; phylogenomics; single cell genomics","Article","ISI"
"Contemporary evolution, allelic recycling, and adaptive radiation of the threespine stickleback","Dont have","Bell, MA; Aguirre, WE","Background: Adaptive radiation in the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) is dramatic, highly replicated, and predictable. Goals: Test hypotheses that divergent phenotypes of freshwater threespine stickleback evolve at the same rate as in other species and that derived freshwater and ancestral oceanic (i.e. marine or anadromous) phenotypes are genetically additive. Update a model for contemporary evolution and adaptive radiation based on new genetic and genomic findings. Methods: Summarize published information on contemporary evolution of threespine stickleback and compare published stickleback rates of evolution to those of other species. Analyse F1 hybrid and pure crosses to estimate the coefficient of genetic dominance of phenotypes that differ between oceanic and freshwater populations. Review published information on the genetics and genomics of stickleback phenotypes. Results: Threespine stickleback populations that experience large environmental changes may evolve measurably for multiple traits within ten generations. Rare freshwater-adapted alleles have been recycled from freshwater to oceanic populations by introgression and increase to high frequencies when oceanic stickleback colonize fresh water. These freshwater-adapted alleles tend to be partially recessive, to produce adaptive phenotypic plasticity, and to be linked within several genomic regions, which facilitates their retention in oceanic populations and the evolutionary response to directional selection after invasion of fresh water. Conclusion: The metapopulation structure and great age of the threespine stickleback have produced a genomic architecture and abundant allelic variation that are conducive to predictable contemporary adaptive radiation involving numerous genes and phenotypic traits.",2013,"evolutionary genomics; gasterosteus aculeatus; introgression; invasive species; parallelism; recessive allele; threespine stickleback","Article","ISI"

In this context, it is crucial to gather biological and ecological information of the main species in marine communities to predict and mitigate potential effects of shifts in their distribution, abundance, and interactions. Using genotyping by sequencing (GBS), we assessed the genetic structure of a keystone species in the Mediterranean shallow littoral ecosystems, the black sea urchin Arbacia lixula. This bioengineer species can shape their communities due to its grazing activity and it is experiencing an ongoing expansion with increasing temperatures. The population genomic analyses on 5,241 loci sequenced in 240 individuals from 11 Mediterranean sampled populations revealed that all populations were diverse and showed significant departure from equilibrium. Albeit genetic differentiation was in general shallow, a significant break separated the western and eastern Mediterranean populations, a break not detected in previous studies with less resolutive markers. Notably, no clear effect of the Almeria-Oran front, an important break in the Atlanto-Mediterranean transition, could be detected among the western basin populations, where only a slight differentiation of the two northernmost populations was found. Despite the generally low levels of genetic differentiation found, we identified candidate regions for local adaptation by combining different genomic analysis with environmental data. Salinity, rather than temperature, seemed to be an important driver of genetic structure in A. lixula. Overall, from a population genomics standpoint, there is ample scope for A. lixula to continue thriving and adapting in the warming Mediterranean.",2021,"benthic communities; engineer species; genotyping by sequencing (gbs); population genomics; sea urchin; outlier analysis","Article","ISI"

Nearly all ray-finned fishes are teleosts, which include most commercially important fish species, several model organisms for genomics and developmental biology, and the dominant component of marine and freshwater vertebrate faunas. Despite the economic and scientific importance of ray-finned fishes, the lack of a single comprehensive phylogeny with corresponding divergence-time estimates has limited our understanding of the evolution and diversification of this radiation. Our analyses, which use multiple nuclear gene sequences in conjunction with 36 fossil age constraints, result in a well-supported phylogeny of all major ray-finned fish lineages and molecular age estimates that are generally consistent with the fossil record. This phylogeny informs three long-standing problems: specifically identifying elopomorphs (eels and tarpons) as the sister lineage of all other teleosts, providing a unique hypothesis on the radiation of early euteleosts, and offering a promising strategy for resolution of the bush at the top of the tree that includes percomorphs and other spiny-finned teleosts. Contrasting our divergence time estimates with studies using a single nuclear gene or whole mitochondrial genomes, we find that the former underestimates ages of the oldest ray-finned fish divergences, but the latter dramatically overestimates ages for derived teleost lineages. Our time-calibrated phylogeny reveals that much of the diversification leading to extant groups of teleosts occurred between the late Mesozoic and early Cenozoic, identifying this period as the Second Age of Fishes.",2012,"actinopterygii; molecular clock; species tree; teleostei; percomorpha","Article","ISI"

A total of 9 candidate reference genes (HPRT, GAPDH, EF1A, TUBA, RPL7, RNAPol II, B2M, ACTB and 18S rRNA) were analyzed by qRT-PCR in 10 tissues (intestine, muscle, stomach, brain, heart, liver, gill, kidney, pectoral fins and spleen) of L. maculatus. Four algorithms, geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and comparative Delta Ct method, were used to evaluate the expression stability of the candidate reference genes. The results showed the 18S rRNA was most stable in different tissues under normal conditions. During salinity stress, RPL7 was the most stable gene according to overall ranking and the best combination of reference genes was RPL7 and RNAPol II. In contrast, GAPDH was the least stable gene which was not suitable as reference genes. The study showed that different algorithms might generate inconsistent results. Therefore, the combination of several reference genes should be selected to accurately calibrate system errors. The present study was the first to select reference genes of L. maculatus by qRT-PCR and provides a useful basis for selecting the appropriate reference gene in L. maculatus.

In this study, we explored connectivity patterns of a marine species with long-distance dispersal, the edible common sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus, focusing mainly on the Adriatic-Ionian basins (Central Mediterranean). We applied a multidisciplinary approach integrating population genomics, based on 1,122 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) obtained from 2b-RAD in 275 samples, with Lagrangian simulations performed with a biophysical model of larval dispersal. We detected genetic homogeneity among eight population samples collected in the focal Adriatic-Ionian area, whereas weak but significant differentiation was found with respect to two samples from the Western Mediterranean (France and Tunisia). This result was not affected by the few putative outlier loci identified in our dataset. Lagrangian simulations found a significant potential for larval exchange among the eight Adriatic-Ionian locations, supporting the hypothesis of connectivity of P.lividus populations in this area. A peculiar pattern emerged from the comparison of our results with those obtained from published P.lividus cytochrome b (cytb) sequences, the latter revealing genetic differentiation in the same geographic area despite a smaller sample size and a lower power to detect differences. The comparison with studies conducted using nuclear markers on other species with similar pelagic larval durations in the same Adriatic-Ionian locations indicates species-specific differences in genetic connectivity patterns and warns against generalizing single-species results to the entire community of rocky shore habitats.",2017,"2b-rad; biophysical models; population genomics; sea urchin; seascape genetics; snps","Article","ISI"

Here, we elucidated the significance of giant enteric symbionts colonizing these fishes regarding their roles in the digestive processes of hosts feeding predominantly on polysiphonous red algae and brown Turbinaria algae, which contain different polysaccharide constituents. Using metagenomics, single-cell genomics, and metatranscriptomic analyses, we provide evidence of metabolic diversification of enteric microbiota involved in the degradation of algal biomass in these fishes. The enteric microbiota is also phylogenetically and functionally simple relative to the complex lignocellulose-degrading microbiota of terrestrial herbivores. Over 90% of the enzymes for deconstructing algal polysaccharides emanate from members of a single bacterial lineage, Candidatus Epulopiscium and related giant bacteria. These symbionts lack cellulases but encode a distinctive and lineage-specific array of mostly intracellular carbohydrases concurrent with the unique and tractable dietary resources of their hosts. Importantly, enzymes initiating the breakdown of the abundant and complex algal polysaccharides also originate from these symbionts. These are also highly transcribed and peak according to the diel lifestyle of their host, further supporting their importance and host-symbiont cospeciation. Because of their distinctive genomic blueprint, we propose the classification of these giant bacteria into three candidate genera. Collectively, our findings show that the acquisition of metabolically distinct Epulopiscium symbionts in hosts feeding on compositionally varied algal diets is a key niche-partitioning driver in the nutritional ecology of herbivorous surgeonfishes.",2017,"piscine herbivores; marine algae; carbohydrases; giant enteric symbionts; epulopiscium","Article","ISI"

However, second-generation sequencing metagenomics (mostly Illumina) suffers from limitations, particularly in the assembly of microbes with high microdiversity and retrieval of the flexible (adaptive) fraction of prokaryotic genomes. Here, we have used a third-generation technique to study the metagenome of a well-known marine sample from the mixed epipelagic water column of the winter Mediterranean. We have compared PacBio Sequel II with the classical approach using Illumina Nextseq short reads followed by assembly to study the metagenome. Long reads allow for efficient direct retrieval of complete genes avoiding the bias of the assembly step. Besides, the application of long reads on metagenomic assembly allows for the reconstruction of much more complete metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), particularly from microbes with high microdiversity such as Pelagibacterales. The flexible genome of reconstructed MAGs was much more complete containing many adaptive genes (some with biotechnological potential). PacBio Sequel II CCS appears particularly suitable for cellular metagenomics due to its low error rate. For most applications of metagenomics, from community structure analysis to ecosystem functioning, long reads should be applied whenever possible. Specifically, for in silico screening of biotechnologically useful genes, or population genomics, long-read metagenomics appears presently as a very fruitful approach and can be analyzed from raw reads before a computationally demanding (and potentially artifactual) assembly step.",2021,"metagenome; metagenome-assembled genomes (mags); long-read sequencing; pacbio ccs long-reads; polyketide synthase (pks); crispr","Article","ISI"

A 16S rRNA phylogeny of available Thermosipho spp. sequences suggested habitat specialists adapted to living in hydrothermal vents only, and habitat generalists inhabiting oil reservoirs, hydrothermal vents, and hotsprings. Comparative genomics of 15 Thermosipho genomes separated them into three distinct species with different habitat distributions: The widely distributed T. africanus and the more specialized, T. melanesiensis and T. affectus. Moreover, the species can be differentiated on the basis of genome size (GS), genome content, and immune system composition. For instance, the T. africanus genomes are largest and contained the most carbohydrate metabolism genes, which could explain why these isolates were obtained from ecologically more divergent habitats. Nonetheless, all the Thermosipho genomes, like other Thermotogae genomes, show evidence of genome streamlining. GS differences between the species could further be correlated to differences in defense capacities against foreign DNA, which influence recombination via HGT. The smallest genomes are found in T. affectus that contain both CRISPR-cas Type I and III systems, but no RM system genes. We suggest that this has caused these genomes to be almost devoid of mobile elements, contrasting the two other species genomes that contain a higher abundance of mobile elements combined with different immune system configurations. Taken together, the comparative genomic analyses of Thermosipho spp. revealed genetic variation allowing habitat differentiation within the genus as well as differentiation with respect to invading mobile DNA.",2018,"extremophiles; hydrothermal vents; mobile dna; speciation; thermotogae; vitamine b-12","Article","ISI"

Edwardsiella piscicida is one of the fish pathogens that seriously infect cultured and wild fish species. To understand the molecular immune mechanisms underlying the response to E. piscicida, a comparative gene transcription analysis was performed through RNA-Seq technology. The low-quality sequences were excluded, and the high-quality sequences were assembled into a total of 60,759 contigs with an average length of 988.95 bp. A gene ontology (GO) analysis was employed to classify 5744 genes according to three major functional categories: molecular function, cellular component and biological process. A total of 19,918 genes were successfully annotated into 26 functional categories according to the clusters of orthologous groups (COG) classification. Furthermore, 15,006 genes were classified into 332 KEGG pathways. The q-value was introduced to estimate 5109 genes significantly differentially expressed which includes 1781 up-regulated genes and 3328 down-regulated genes. The differentially expressed genes were involved in the major immune-related pathways which refer to the pathogen recognition, inflammation, Toll-like receptor and chemokine signalling pathways. Moreover, 24,487 potential simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and 193,760 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected and identified in the C. striata liver transcriptome.

Over 412 Mb of sequence data were generated, comprising 1.4 million reads of average length 286 bp. De nova assembly using Newbler 2.3 yielded 156 contigs plus 22 869 isotigs, which in turn clustered into 18 576 isogroups.

Although they are sister groups, kinetoplastids and diplonemids have very distinct mitochondrial genome architectures, requiring widespread insertion/deletion RNA editing and extensive trans-splicing, respectively, in order to generate functional transcripts. The evolutionary history by which these differing processes arose remains unclear. Using single-cell genomics, followed by small sub unit ribosomal DNA and multigene phylogenies, we identified an isolated marine cell that branches on phylogenetic trees as a sister to known kinetoplastids. Analysis of singlecell amplified genomic material identified multiple mitochondrial genome contigs. These revealed a gene architecture resembling that of diplonemid mitochondria, with small fragments of genes encoded out of order and or on different contigs, indicating that these genes require extensive trans-splicing. Conversely, no requirement for kinetoplastid-like insertion/deletion RNA-editing was detected. Additionally, while we identified some proteins so far only found in kinetoplastids, we could not unequivocally identify mitochondrial RNA editing proteins. These data invite the hypothesis that extensive genome fragmentation and trans-splicing were the ancestral states for the kinetoplastid-diplonemid lade but were lost during the kinetoplastid radiation. This study demonstrates that single-cell approaches can successfully retrieve lineages that represent important new branches on the tree of life, and thus can illuminate major evolutionary and functional transitions in eukaryotes.

"Marine natural products for multi-targeted cancer treatment: A future insight","10.1016/j.biopha.2018.05.142","Kumar, MS; Adki, KM","Cancer is world's second largest alarming disease, which involves abnormal cell growth and have potential to spread to other parts of the body. Most of the available anticancer drugs are designed to act on specific targets by altering the activity of involved transporters and genes. As cancer cells exhibit complex cellular machinery, the regeneration of cancer tissues and chemo resistance towards the therapy has been the main obstacle in cancer treatment. This fact encourages the researchers to explore the multitargeted use of existing medicines to overcome the shortcomings of chemotherapy for alternative and safer treatment strategies. Recent developments in genomics-proteomics and an understanding of the molecular pharmacology of cancer have also challenged researchers to come up with target-based drugs. The literature supports the evidence of natural compounds exhibiting antioxidant, antimitotic, anti-inflammatory, antibiotic as well as anticancer activity. In this review, we have selected marine sponges as a prolific source of bioactive compounds which can be explored for their possible use in cancer and have tried to link their role in cancer pathway. To prove this, we revisited the literature for the selection of cancer genes for the multitargeted use of existing drugs and natural products. We used Cytoscape network analysis and Search tool for retrieval of interacting genes/ proteins (STRING) to study the possible interactions to show the links between the antioxidants, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory and antimitotic agents and their targets for their possible use in cancer. We included total 78 pathways, their genes and natural compounds from the above four pharmacological classes used in cancer treatment for multitargeted approach. Based on the Cytoscape network analysis results, we shortlist 22 genes based on their average shortest path length connecting one node to all other nodes in a network.

"Phylogenomic Analyses of Members of the Widespread Marine Heterotrophic Genus Pseudovibrio Suggest Distinct Evolutionary Trajectories and a Novel Genus, Polycladidibacter gen. nov.","10.1128/AEM.02395-19","Hinger, I; Ansorge, R; Mussmann, M; Romano, S","Bacteria belonging to the Pseudovibrio genus are widespread, metabolically versatile, and able to thrive as both free-living and host-associated organisms. Although more than 50 genomes are available, a comprehensive comparative genomics study to resolve taxonomic inconsistencies is currently missing. We analyzed all available genomes and used 552 core genes to perform a robust phylogenomic reconstruction. This in-depth analysis revealed the divergence of two monophyletic basal lineages of strains isolated from polyclad flatworm hosts, namely, Pseudovibrio hongkongensis and Pseudovibrio stylochi. These strains have reduced genomes and lack sulfur-related metabolisms and major biosynthetic gene clusters, and their environmental distribution appears to be tightly associated with invertebrate hosts. We showed experimentally that the divergent strains are unable to utilize various sulfur compounds that, in contrast, can be utilized by the type strain Pseudovibrio denirrificons. Our analyses suggest that the lineage leading to these two strains has been subject to relaxed purifying selection resulting in great gene loss. Overall genome relatedness indices (OGRI) indicate substantial differences between the divergent strains and the rest of the genus. While 16S rRNA gene analyses do not support the establishment of a different genus for the divergent strains, their substantial genomic, phylogenomic, and physiological differences strongly suggest a divergent evolutionary trajectory and the need for their reclassification. Therefore, we propose the novel genus Polycladidibacter gen. nov. IMPORTANCE The genus Pseudovibrio is commonly associated with marine invertebrates, which are essential for ocean health and marine nutrient cycling. Traditionally, the phylogeny of the genus has been based on 16S rRNA gene analysis. The use of the 16S rRNA gene or any other single marker gene for robust phylogenetic placement has recently been questioned. We used a large set of marker genes from all available Pseudovibrio genomes for in-depth phylogenomic analyses. We identified divergent monophyletic basal lineages within the Pseudovibrio genus, including two strains isolated from polyclad flatworms. These strains showed reduced sulfur metabolism and biosynthesis capacities. The phylogenomic analyses revealed distinct evolutionary trajectories and ecological adaptations that differentiate the divergent strains from the other Pseudovibrio members and suggest that they fall into a novel genus. Our data show the importance of widening the use of phylogenomics for better understanding bacterial physiology, phylogeny, and evolution.",2020,"pseudovibrio; evolution; symbiont; secondary metabolites; comparative genomics; natural selection","Article","ISI"
"Ambient pH Alters the Protein Content of Outer Membrane Vesicles, Driving Host Development in a Beneficial Symbiosis","10.1128/JB.00319-19","Lynch, JB; Schwartzman, JA; Bennett, BD; McAnulty, SJ; Knop, M; Nyholm, SV; Ruby, EG","Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are continuously produced by Gram-negative bacteria and are increasingly recognized as ubiquitous mediators of bacterial physiology. In particular, OMVs are powerful effectors in interorganismal interactions, driven largely by their molecular contents. These impacts have been studied extensively in bacterial pathogenesis but have not been well documented within the context of mutualism. Here, we examined the proteomic composition of OMVs from the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri, which forms a specific mutualism with the Hawaiian bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes. We found that V. fischeri upregulates transcription of its major outer membrane protein, OmpU, during growth at an acidic pH, which V. fischeri experiences when it transitions from its environmental reservoir to host tissues. We used comparative genomics and DNA pulldown analyses to search for regulators of ompU and found that differential expression of ompU is governed by the OmpR, H-NS, and ToxR proteins. This transcriptional control combines with nutritional conditions to govern OmpU levels in OMVs. Under a host-encountered acidic pH, V. fischeri OMVs become more potent stimulators of symbiotic host development in an OmpU-dependent manner. Finally, we found that symbiotic development could be stimulated by OMVs containing a homolog of OmpU from the pathogenic species Vibrio cholerae, connecting the role of a well-described virulence factor with a mutualistic element. This work explores the symbiotic effects of OMV variation, identifies regulatory machinery shared between pathogenic and mutualistic bacteria, and provides evidence of the role that OMVs play in animal-bacterium mutualism. IMPORTANCE Beneficial bacteria communicate with their hosts through a variety of means. These communications are often carried out by a combination of molecules that stimulate responses from the host and are necessary for development of the relationship between these organisms. Naturally produced bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) contain many of those molecules and can stimulate a wide range of responses from recipient organisms. Here, we describe how a marine bacterium, Vibrio fischeri, changes the makeup of its OMVs under conditions that it experiences as it goes from its free-living lifestyle to associating with its natural host, the Hawaiian bobtail squid. This work improves our understanding of how bacteria change their signaling profile as they begin to associate with their beneficial partner animals.",2019,"vibrio fischeri; squid-vibrio symbiosis; outer membrane vesicles","Article","ISI"

Their fat metabolism may differ from that of other mammals because toothed whales have acoustic fats. Gene expression in the metabolic pathways of animals can change with respect to their evolution and environment. A real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a reliable technique for studying the relative expressions of genes. However, since the accuracy of RT-qPCR data is totally dependent on the reference gene, the selection of the reference gene is an essential step. In this study, 10 candidate reference genes (ZC3H10, FTL, LGALS1, RPL27, GAPDH, FTH1, DCN, TCTP, NDUS5, and UBIM) were initially tested for amplification efficiency using RT-qPCR. After excluding DCN, the remaining nine genes, which are nearly 100% efficient, were selected for the gene stability analysis. Stable reference genes across eight different fat tissue, liver, and muscle samples from Grampus griseus were identified by four algorithms, which were provided in Genorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and Delta CT. Finally, a RefFinder comprehensive ranking was performed based on the stability values, and the nine genes were ranked as follows: LGALS1 > FTL > GAPDH > ZC3H10 > FTH1 > NDUS5 > TCTP > RPL27 > UBIM. The LGALS1 and FTL genes were identified as the most stable novel reference genes. The third-ranked gene, GAPDH, is a well-known housekeeping gene for mammals. Ultimately, we suggest the use of LGALS1 as a reliable novel reference gene for genomics studies on the lipid-related aquatic adaptations of toothed whales.",2021,"cetacean; gene expression; gene stability; qpcr; reference gene; transcriptomics","Article","ISI"
"Natural CO2 seeps reveal adaptive potential to ocean acidification in fish","10.1111/eva.13239","Petit-Marty, N; Nagelkerken, I; Connell, SD; Schunter, C","Volcanic CO2 seeps are natural laboratories that can provide insights into the adaptation of species to ocean acidification. While many species are challenged by reduced-pH levels, some species benefit from the altered environment and thrive. Here, we explore the molecular mechanisms of adaptation to ocean acidification in a population of a temperate fish species that experiences increased population sizes under elevated CO2. Fish from CO2 seeps exhibited an overall increased gene expression in gonad tissue compared with those from ambient CO2 sites. Up-regulated genes at CO2 seeps are possible targets of adaptive selection as they can directly influence the physiological performance of fishes exposed to ocean acidification. Most of the up-regulated genes at seeps were functionally involved in the maintenance of pH homeostasis and increased metabolism, and presented a deviation from neutral evolution expectations in their patterns of DNA polymorphisms, providing evidence for adaptive selection to ocean acidification. The targets of this adaptive selection are likely regulatory sequences responsible for the increased expression of these genes, which would allow a fine-tuned physiological regulation to maintain homeostasis and thrive at CO2 seeps. Our findings reveal that standing genetic variation in DNA sequences regulating the expression of genes in response to a reduced-pH environment could provide for adaptive potential to near-future ocean acidification in fishes. Moreover, with this study we provide a forthright methodology combining transcriptomics and genomics, which can be applied to infer the adaptive potential to different environmental conditions in wild marine populations.",2021,"adaptation; balancing selection; gene expression; global change; standing genetic variation; transcriptomics","Article","ISI"

Despite they have been historically used in a variety of research fields, ranging from genomics to ecology, their evolutionary origin and genetic structure remains elusive for most valid species. There are currently 19 valid species distributed in 5 subgenera, which can have restricted to cosmopolitan distribution patterns. However, their true biodiversity and biographical distribution are blurred by evidences of cryptic species within most of these valid species. Here, we inferred a 18S rDNA-based time-calibrated tree to determine the evolutionary origin of extantParameciumlineages and intra-genus phylogenetic relationships. Next, we used two common computational species delimitation algorithms (PTP and mPTP) to analyze a population-level (cytochrome oxidase subunit I [COI]) phylogeny to predict the existence of independent evolutionary unities (IEUs) within validParameciummorphospecies. Our data suggest that, some cosmopolitanParameciummay have emerged prior to the Cretaceous period (before the complete separation of the continents), thus, explaining their wide distribution pattern. We found that the diversity of cryptic species may be higher than previous though and that most of the validParameciumspecies should be, in fact considered as complexes of species, composed each by IEUs that can co-occur within restricted or wide geographical areas. Moreover, our data indicate that these species delimitation algorithms (PTP and mPTP) may be of great assistance to uncover the diversity of cryptic species withinParamecium(or any other microeukaryote) by indicating potential candidates for more in detail future studies of taxonomists through integrative taxonomy frameworks.",2020,"cryptic species; genetic diversity; independent evolutionary units; intraspecies delimitation; phylogeography; species complex; time-calibrated tree","Article","ISI"
"The first world swimming championships of roseobacters-Phylogenomic insights into an exceptional motility phenotype","10.1016/j.syapm.2018.08.012","Bartling, P; Vollmers, J; Petersen, J","Many marine Alphaproteobacteria of the Roseobacter group show a characteristic swim-or-stick lifestyle, for which motility is a crucial trait. Three phylogenetically distinct flagellar gene clusters (FGCs) have been identified in Rhodobacteraceae that have been named flal, fla2 and fla3 according to their relative abundance. In addition to the flagellar-dependent swimming and swarming motility, pilus-dependent twitching mediates bacterial locomotion. Furthermore, filament independent modes of motility, namely gliding and sliding, have been described for various microorganisms. However, no mode of motility other than swimming has so far been described for roseobacters. In the present study, we investigated motility, distribution of flagellar systems and the phylogeny of 120 genome-sequenced Rhodobacteraceae. The phylogenetically broad taxon sampling that included 114 type strains revealed the presence of at least ten distinct clades that were statistically well supported. The investigation of the actual physiological capacity for swimming motility on soft agar plates showed that only about half of the 120 tested strains were motile under the tested conditions. Seven strains developed a conspicuous dendritic motility phenotype that was reminiscent of the swarming motility in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The observed dendritic motility in two strains (i.e. Sulfitobacter pseudonitzschiae DSM 26842 and Roseovarius pacificus DSM 29589) was particularly surprising because they did not harbor any genes of the FGC. Accordingly, it was concluded that this form of dendritic motility was independent of a flagellum. A comparative genomics approach allowed a remarkable number of pilus-related candidate genes to be identified for this novel type of motility in Rhodobacteraceae. (C) 2018 The Authors.

The recovered and assembled genomes predict physiology, consortium interactions and gene function, but experimental validation of metabolisms and molecular pathways requires more directed approaches. Gene function and the correlation between phenotype and genotype is most obviously studied with genetics, and it is therefore critical to develop techniques permitting rapid and facile strain construction. Many new and candidate archaeal lineages have recently been discovered, but experimental, genetic access to archaeal genomes is currently limited to a few model organisms. The results obtained from manipulating the genomes of these genetically-accessible organisms have already had profound effects on our understanding of archaeal physiology and information processing systems, and these continued studies also help resolve phylogenetic reconstruction of the tree of life. The hyperthermophilic, planktonic, marine heterotrophic archaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis, has emerged as an ideal genetic system with a suite of techniques available to add or delete encoded activities, or modify expression of genes in vivo. We outline here techniques to rapidly and markerlessly delete a single, or repetitively delete several, continuous sequences from the T kodakarensis genome. Our procedure includes details on the construction of the plasmid DNA necessary for transformation that directs, via homologous recombination, integration into the genome, identification of strains that have incorporated plasmid sequences (termed intermediate strains), and confirmation of plasmid excision, leading to deletion of the target gene in final strains. Near identical procedures can be employed to modify, rather than delete, a genomic locus.",2017,"genome editing; gene deletion; thermococcus kodakarensis","Article","ISI"

Marine stramenopiles (MAS), which are a diverse assemblage of algae that acquired photosynthesis from secondary endosymbiosis, include single-celled organisms such as diatoms as well as multicellular forms such as brown algae. The recent publication of two diatom genomes that diverged similar to 90 million years ago (mya), as well as the one of a brown algae that diverged from diatoms similar to 250 Mya, provide a great system of related, yet diverged set of organisms to compare epigenetic marks and their relationships. For example, putative DNA methyltransferase homologues were found in diatoms while none could be identified in the brown algal genome. On the other hand, no canonical DICER-like protein was found in diatoms in contrast to what is observed in brown algae. A key interest relies in understanding the adaptive nature of epigenetics and its inheritability. In contrast to yeast that lack DNA methylation, homogeneous cultures of diatoms constitute an attractive system to study epigenetic changes in response to environmental conditions such as nutrient-rich to nutrient-poor transitions which is especially relevant because of their ecological importance. P. tricornutum is also of outstanding interest because it is observed as three different morphotypes and thus constitutes a simple and promising model for the study of the epigenetic phenomena that accompany cellular differentiation.

"Loss of a chloroplast encoded function could influence species range in kelp","10.1002/ece3.5428","Rana, S; Valentin, K; Bartsch, I; Glockner, G","Kelps are important providers and constituents of marine ecological niches, the coastal kelp forests. Kelp species have differing distribution ranges, but mainly thrive in temperate and arctic regions. Although the principal factors determining biogeographic distribution ranges are known, genomics could provide additional answers to this question. We sequenced DNA from two Laminaria species with contrasting distribution ranges, Laminaria digitata and Laminaria solidungula. Laminaria digitata is found in the Northern Atlantic with a southern boundary in Brittany (France) or Massachusetts (USA) and a northern boundary in the Arctic, whereas L. solidungula is endemic to the Arctic only. From the raw reads of DNA, we reconstructed both chloroplast genomes and annotated them. A concatenated data set of all available brown algae chloroplast sequences was used for the calculation of a robust phylogeny, and sequence variations were analyzed. The two Laminaria chloroplast genomes are collinear to previously analyzed kelp chloroplast genomes with important exceptions. Rearrangements at the inverted repeat regions led to the pseudogenization of ycf37 in L. solidungula, a gene possibly required under high light conditions. This defunct gene might be one of the reasons why the habitat range of L. solidungula is restricted to lowlight sublittoral sites in the Arctic. The inheritance pattern of single nucleotide polymorphisms suggests incomplete lineage sorting of chloroplast genomes in kelp species. Our analysis of kelp chloroplast genomes shows that not only evolutionary information could be gleaned from sequence data. Concomitantly, those sequences can also tell us something about the ecological conditions which are required for species well-being.",2019,"chloroplast genome analysis; habitat range; kelp; multinucleotide substitutions","Article","ISI"

The highly pathogenic V. anguillarum strain MVM425 has been isolated from moribund turbot in the China Yellow Sea, but the genetic basis for its pathogenesis is undefined. Complete genome sequencing uncovered that the bacterium encodes 3985 protein-coding sequences (CDSs) on two chromosomes and 62 CDSs on the virulence plasmid pEIB1. To investigate the genes that are essential for its in vitro and in vivo growth, we applied transposon insertion sequencing technology (Tn-seq) to screen a highly saturated transposon insertion mutant library grown in Luria-Bertani broth with 2% NaCl (LB20) and in its natural host turbot. Tn-seq identified 473 and similar to 173 putative genes as essential for its growth in rich medium and the in vivo infection process, respectively. Additionally, our analysis revealed that the genes are associated to various fitness levels in the liver, spleen and kidney, suggesting different genetic requirements for colonization in these organs. Furthermore, we validated our Tn-seq data using gene knockout mutants and in vivo infection experiments. Comprehensive functional genomics analysis highlighted the conditionally essential genes for important pathways involved in energy metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, nucleotide synthesis, amino acid synthesis, cofactors, siderophore synthesis, secretion (T1SS, T2SS, and T6SS), quorum sensing, and flagellum biosynthesis.

Decades of research have illuminated the pathogenic mechanisms, molecular biology, and genomics of model apicomplexans, but we know little about their diversity and distribution in natural environments. In this study we analyze the distribution of apicomplexans across a range of both host-associated and free-living environments. Using publicly available small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene databases, high-throughput environmental sequencing (HTES) surveys, and our own generated HTES data, we developed an apicomplexan reference database, which includes the largest apicomplexan SSU rRNA tree available to date and encompasses comprehensive sampling of this group and their closest relatives. This tree allowed us to identify and correct incongruences in the molecular identification of apicomplexan sequences. Analyzing the diversity and distribution of apicomplexans in HTES studies with this curated reference database also showed a widespread, and quantitatively important, presence of apicomplexans across a variety of free-living environments. These data allow us to describe a remarkable molecular diversity of this group compared with our current knowledge, especially when compared with that identified from described apicomplexan species. This is most striking in marine environments, where potentially the most diverse apicomplexans apparently exist, but have not yet been formally recognized. The new database will be useful for microbial ecology and epidemiological studies, and provide valuable reference for medical and veterinary diagnosis especially in cases of emerging, zoonotic, and cryptic infections.",2019,"apicomplexans; diversity; distribution; phylogeny; classification; metabarcoding; environmental sequencing; reference database","Article","ISI"

Streptomyces strain SM8 extracts showed antibacterial and antifungal activity. NMR analysis of the active fractions proved that hydroxylated saturated fatty acids were the major components present in the antibacterial fractions. Antimycin compounds were initially putatively identified in the antifungal fractions using LC-Orbitrap. Their presence was later confirmed by comparison to a standard. Genomic analysis of Streptomyces sp.

Biological communities inhabiting these ecosystems are often distributed in widely separated habitats, raising intriguing questions on how these organisms achieve connectivity and whether habitat types facilitate intraspecific divergence. The deep-sea patellogastropod limpet Bathyacmaea nipponica that colonizes both vents and seeps across similar to 2,400 km in the Northwest Pacific is a feasible model to answer these questions. We analyzed 123 individuals from four vents and three seeps using a comprehensive method incorporating population genomics and physical ocean modeling. Genome survey sequencing and genotyping-by-sequencing resulted in 9,838 single-nucleotide polymorphisms for population genomic analyses. Genetic divergence and demographic analyses revealed four habitat-linked (i.e., three seep and one vent) genetic groups, with the vent genetic group established via the opportunistic invasion of a few limpet larvae from a nearby seep genetic group. TreeMix analysis uncovered three historical seep-to-vent migration events. ADMIXTURE and divMigrate analyses elucidated weak contemporary gene flow from a seep genetic group to the vent genetic group. Physical ocean modeling underlined the potential roles of seafloor topography and ocean currents in shaping the genetic connectivity, contemporary migration, and local hybridization of these deep-sea limpets. Our study highlighted the power of integrating genomic and oceanographic approaches in deciphering the demography and diversification of deep-sea organisms.

They are major primary producers and highly active predators in marine and fresh water systems. While genomics has accelerated in recent years for this taxonomically diverse group, our understanding of the metabolic capabilities of most protists remains limited. It is also poorly understood how protist trophic mode is affected by biotic and abiotic factors, and therefore it is difficult to predict how events such as global climate change will affect the balance between autotrophic and heterotrophic activities in protist communities. To address open questions regarding how protist metabolic versatility is influenced by their environment, we characterized the potential for carbon fixation versus organic carbon degradation using enzymatic assays (RubisCO and beta-D-glucosaminidase, respectively) within the water columns of ice-covered lakes in McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV), Antarctica. Steep physical and chemical gradients in the water columns, microorganism domination and minimal allochthonous inputs makes the MDV lakes uniquely suited to investigate environment-microbe interactions. Spatial trends in RubisCO and beta-D-glucosaminidase activities were lake-specific and vertically stratified within the water columns. Moreover, bottom-up drivers controlling the activity of C-fixation vs. organic C-degradation among the MDV protist communities were distinct between the upper photic vs. the deep, aphotic zones.

This is despite the presence of CO2-concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) in some species that maximize inorganic carbon uptake. We investigated the effects of inorganic carbon on the seasonal distribution, growth rates and photosynthesis of a freshwater diatom, Asterionella formosa, and the nature of its CCM using genomics. In a productive lake, the frequency of A. formosa declined with CO2 concentration below air-equilibrium. In contrast, CO2 concentrations at 2.5-times air-equilibrium did not increase growth rate, cell C-quota or the ability to remove inorganic carbon. A pH-drift experiment strongly suggested that HCO3- as well as CO2 could be used. Calculations combining hourly inorganic carbon concentrations in a lake with known CO2 and HCO3- uptake kinetics suggested that rates of photosynthesis of A. formosa would be approximately carbon saturated and largely dependent on CO2 uptake when CO2 was at or above air-equilibrium. However, during summer carbon depletion, HCO3- would be the major form of carbon taken up and carbon saturation will fall to around 30%. Genes encoding proteins involved in CCMs were identified in the nuclear genome of A. formosa. We found carbonic anhydrases from subclasses alpha, beta, gamma and theta, as well as solute carriers from families 4 and 26 involved in HCO3- transport, but no periplasmic carbonic anhydrase.

However, mineral-associated biomolecules involved in biomineralization are still poorly characterised. We report the first comprehensive structural and biomolecular study of Spondylus gaederopus, a pectinoid bivalve with a peculiar shell texture. Used since prehistoric times, this is the best-known shell of Europe's cultural heritage. We find that Spondylus microstructure is very poor in mineral-bound organics, which are mostly intercrystalline and concentrated at the interface between structural layers. Using high-resolution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) we characterized several shell protein fractions, isolated following different bleaching treatments. Several peptides were identified as well as six shell proteins, which display features and domains typically found in biomineralized tissues, including the prevalence of intrinsically disordered regions. It is very likely that these sequences only partially represent the full proteome of Spondylus, considering the lack of genomics data for this genus and the fact that most of the reconstructed peptides do not match with any known shell proteins, representing consequently lineage-specific sequences. This work sheds light onto the shell matrix involved in the biomineralization in spondylids. Our proteomics data suggest that Spondylus has evolved a shell-forming toolkit, distinct from that of other better studied pectinoids - fine-tuned to produce shell structures with high mechanical properties, while limited in organic content.

REIMS is an emerging technique able to characterize different samples rapidly, affording a comprehensive profile usable as a fingerprint, without the need for preliminary extraction or cleanup procedures. In detail, a REIMS source is coupled to a high-resolution tandem mass spectrometer; such coupling allows one to maximize the amount of information (discriminant features) collected for a single analysis, as well as to focus on target analytes to achieve enhanced sensitivity and selectivity. A database was created from 18 marine species typical of the Mediterranean Sea, all caught in the very small area of the Strait of Messina, and reliable identification was achieved for each species with confidence higher than 99%.

A unique way to study evolutionary and ecological mechanisms that either limit species' spread or facilitate range expansions is to conduct research on species that have restricted distributions. Nonindigenous species, particularly those that are highly invasive but have not yet spread beyond the introduced site, represent ideal systems to study range size changes. Here, we used species distribution modeling and genomic data to study the restricted range of a highly invasive Australian marine species, the ascidian Pyura praeputialis. This species is an aggressive space occupier in its introduced range (Chile), where it has fundamentally altered the coastal community. We found high genomic diversity in Chile, indicating high adaptive potential. In addition, genomic data clearly showed that a single region from Australia was the only donor of genotypes to the introduced range. We identified over 3,500 km of suitable habitat adjacent to its current introduced range that has so far not been occupied, and importantly species distribution models were only accurate when genomic data were considered. Our results suggest that a slight change in currents, or a change in shipping routes, may lead to an expansion of the species' introduced range that will encompass a vast portion of the South American coast.

"Phylogenetic Permulations: A Statistically Rigorous Approach to Measure Confidence in Associations in a Phylogenetic Context","10.1093/molbev/msab068","Saputra, E; Kowalczyk, A; Cusick, L; Clark, N; Chikina, M","Many evolutionary comparative methods seek to identify associations between phenotypic traits or between traits and genotypes, often with the goal of inferring potential functional relationships between them. Comparative genomics methods aimed at this goal measure the association between evolutionary changes at the genetic level with traits evolving convergently across phylogenetic lineages. However, these methods have complex statistical behaviors that are influenced by nontrivial and oftentimes unknown confounding factors. Consequently, using standard statistical analyses in interpreting the outputs of these methods leads to potentially inaccurate conclusions. Here, we introduce phylogenetic permulations, a novel statistical strategy that combines phylogenetic simulations and permutations to calculate accurate, unbiased P values from phylogenetic methods. Permulations construct the null expectation for P values from a given phylogenetic method by empirically generating null phenotypes. Subsequently, empirical P values that capture the true statistical confidence given the correlation structure in the data are directly calculated based on the empirical null expectation. We examine the performance of permulation methods by analyzing both binary and continuous phenotypes, including marine, subterranean, and long-lived large-bodied mammal phenotypes. Our results reveal that permulations improve the statistical power of phylogenetic analyses and correctly calibrate statements of confidence in rejecting complex null distributions while maintaining or improving the enrichment of known functions related to the phenotype. We also find that permulations refine pathway enrichment analyses by correcting for non-independence in gene ranks. Our results demonstrate that permulations are a powerful tool for improving statistical confidence in the conclusions of phylogenetic analysis when the parametric null is unknown.",2021,"statistical phylogenetics; genotype-phenotype association; comparative genomics; convergent evolution; phylogenetic generalized least squares; evolutionary rate convergence","Article","ISI"

It provokes Piscirickettsiosis outbreaks in the marine phase of salmonid farming, resulting in economic losses. The monophyletic genogroup LF-89 and a divergent genogroup EM-90 are responsible for the most severe Piscirickettsiosis outbreaks in Chile. Therefore, the development of methods for quick genotyping of P. salmonis genogroups in field samples is vital for veterinary diagnoses and understanding the population structure of this pathogen. The present study reports the development of a multiplex PCR for genotyping LF-89 and EM-90 genogroups based on comparative genomics of 73 fully sequenced P. salmonis genomes. The results revealed 2,322 sequences shared between 35 LF-89 genomes, 2,280 sequences in the core-genome of 38 EM-90 genomes, and 331 and 534 accessory coding sequences each genogroup, respectively. A total of 1,801 clusters of coding sequences were shared among all tested genomes of P. salmonis (LF-89 and EM-90), with 253 and 291 unique sequences for LF-89 and EM-90 genogroups, respectively. The Multiplex-1 prototype was chosen for reliable genotyping because of differences in annealing temperatures and respective reaction efficiencies. This method also identified the pathogen in field samples infected with LF-89 or EM-90 strains, which is not possible with other methods currently available.

"Distribution and dynamics of epidemic and pandemic Vibrio parahaemolyticus virulence factors","10.3389/fcimb.2013.00097","Ceccarelli, D; Hasan, NA; Huq, A; Colwell, RR","Vibrio parahaemolyticus, autochthonous to estuarine, marine, and coastal environments throughout the world, is the causative agent of food-borne gastroenteritis. More than 80 serotypes have been described worldwide, based on antigenic properties of the somatic (O) and capsular (K) antigens. Serovar O3:K6 emerged in India in 1996 and subsequently was isolated worldwide, leading to the conclusion that the first V parahaemolyticus pandemic had taken place. Most strains of V parahaemolyticus isolated from the environment or seafood, in contrast to clinical strains, do not produce a thermostable direct hemolysin (TDH) and/or a TDH-related hemolysin (TRH). Type 3 secretion systems (T3SSs), needle-like apparatuses able to deliver bacterial effectors into host cytoplasm, were identified as triggering cytotoxicity and enterotoxicity. Type 6 secretion systems (T6SS) predicted to be involved in intracellular trafficking and vesicular transport appear to play a role in V parahaemolyticus virulence. Recent advances in V parahaemolyticus genomics identified several pathogenicity islands (Vpals) located on either chromosome in both epidemic and pandemic strains and comprising additional colonization factors, such as restriction-modification complexes, chemotaxis proteins, classical bacterial surface virulence factors, and putative colicins. Furthermore, studies indicate strains lacking toxins and genomic regions associated with pathogenicity may also be pathogenic, suggesting other important virulence factors remain to be identified. The unique repertoire of virulence factors identified to date, their occurrence and distribution in both epidemic and pandemic strains worldwide are described, with the aim of highlighting the complexity of V parahaemolyticus pathogenicity as well as its dynamic genome.",2013,"v. parahaemolyticus; o3:k6; tdh; trh; pai; virulence markers; pandemic strains; epidemic strains","Article","ISI"
"Evolutionary relationships of Metchnikovella dogieli Paskerova et al., 2016 (Microsporidia: Metchnikovellidae) revealed by multigene phylogenetic analysis","10.1007/s00436-020-06976-x","Nassonova, ES; Bondarenko, NI; Paskerova, GG; Kovacikova, M; Frolova, EV; Smirnov, AV","The species Metchnikovella dogieli (Paskerova et al. Protistology 10:148-157, 2016) belongs to one of the early diverging microsporidian groups, the metchnikovellids (Microsporidia: Metchnikovellidae). In relation to typical ('core') microsporidia, this group is considered primitive. The spores of metchnikovellids have no classical polar sac-anchoring disk complex, no coiled polar tube, no posterior vacuole, and no polaroplast. Instead, they possess a short thick manubrium that expands into a manubrial cistern. These organisms are hyperparasites; they infect gregarines that parasitise marine invertebrates. M. dogieli is a parasite of the archigregarine Selenidium pygospionis (Paskerova et al. Protist 169:826-852, 2018), which parasitises the polychaete Pygospio elegans. This species was discovered in samples collected in the silt littoral zone at the coast of the White Sea, North-West Russia, and was described based on light microscopy. No molecular data are available for this species, and the publicly accessible genomic data for metchnikovellids are limited to two species: M. incurvata Caullery & Mesnil, 1914 and Amphiamblys sp. WSBS2006. In the present study, we applied single-cell genomics methods with whole-genome amplification to perform next-generation sequencing of M. dogieli genomic DNA. We performed a phylogenetic analysis based on the SSU rRNA gene and reconstructed a multigene phylogeny using a concatenated alignment that included 46 conserved single-copy protein domains. The analyses recovered a fully supported clade of metchnikovellids as a basal group to the core microsporidia. Two members of the genus Metchnikovella did not form a clade in our tree. This may indicate that this genus is paraphyletic and requires revision.",2021,"microsporidia; metchnikovellids; phylogeny; phylogenomics","Article","ISI"
"A CAZyme-Rich Genome of a Taxonomically Novel Rhodophyte-Associated Carrageenolytic Marine Bacterium","10.1007/s10126-018-9840-6","Boncan, DAT; David, AME; Lluisma, AO","Carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) have significant biotechnological potential as agents for degradation or modification of polysaccharides/glycans. As marine macroalgae are known to be rich in various types of polysaccharides, seaweed-associated bacteria are likely to be a good source of these CAZymes. A genomics approach can be used to explore CAZyme abundance and diversity, but it can also provide deep insights into the biology of CAZyme producers and, in particular, into molecular mechanisms that mediate their interaction with their hosts. In this study, a Gram-negative, aerobic, rod-shaped, carrageenolytic, and culturable marine bacterium designated as AOL6 was isolated from a diseased thallus of a carrageenan-producing farmed rhodophyte, Kappaphycus alvarezii (Gigartinales, Rhodophyta). The whole genome of this bacterium was sequenced and characterized. Sequence reads were assembled producing a high-quality genome assembly. The estimated genome size of the bacterium is 4.4Mb and a G+C content of 52%. Molecular phylogenetic analysis based on a complete sequence of 16S rRNA, rpoB, and a set of 38 single-copy genes suggests that the bacterium is an unknown species and represents a novel genus in the family Cellvibrionaceae that is most closely related to the genera Teredinibacter and Saccharophagus. Genome comparison with T. turnerae T7901 and S. degradans 2-40 reveals several features shared by the three species, including a large number of CAZymes that comprised >5% of the total number of protein-coding genes. The high proportion of CAZymes found in the AOL6 genome exceeds that of other known carbohydrate degraders, suggesting a significant capacity to degrade a range of polysaccharides including -carrageenan; 34% of these CAZymes have signal peptide sequences for secretion. Three putative -carrageenase-encoding genes were identified from the genome of the bacterium via in silico analysis, consistent with the results of the zymography assay (with -carrageenan as substrate). Genome analysis also indicated that AOL6 relies exclusively on type 2 secretion system (T2SS) for secreting proteins (possibly including glycoside hydrolases). In relation to T2SS, the product of the pilZ gene was predicted to be highly expressed, suggesting specialization for cell adhesion and secretion of virulence factors. The assignment of proteins to clusters of orthologous groups (COGs) revealed a pattern characteristic of r-strategists. Majority of two-component system proteins identified in the AOL6 genome were also predicted to be involved in chemotaxis and surface colonization. These genomic features suggest that AOL6 is an opportunistic pathogen, adapted to colonizing polysaccharide-rich hosts, including carrageenophytes.",2018,"kappaphycus alvarezii; cazymes; cellvibrionaceae; phylogenetics; two-component system (tcs)","Article","ISI"
"Male Differentiation in the Marine Copepod Oithona nana Reveals the Development of a New Nervous Ganglion and Lin12-Notch-Repeat Protein-Associated Proteolysis","10.3390/biology10070657","Sugier, K; Laso-Jadart, R; Vacherie, B; Kafer, J; Bertrand, L; Labadie, K; Martins, N; Orvain, C; Petit, E; Wincker, P; Jamet, JL; Alberti, A; Madoui, MA","Simple Summary Copepods are tiny crustaceans and the most abundant animals on Earth; they also play a crucial role in the marine food chain. Among copepods, Oithona is one of most ecologically successful and is known for its differential behavior between males and females. The males adopt the strategy live fast, die young: they are constantly in motion to search for females, more vulnerable to predators, feed less, and have a higher mortality rate. In our study, we found the presence of a new male-specific ganglion in Oithona nana probably involved in female cues sensing. We also demonstrate the potential role of new Lin-12 Notch Repeat proteins in the development of this ganglion by interacting with proteins involved in the development of the nervous system. Thanks to our findings, we propose that the live fast, die young strategy of the O. nana males is optimized by the explosion of these Lin-12 Notch Repeat proteins in the male proteome involved in the development of the male-specific olfactory ganglion to increase female cue sensing and mating. Copepods are among the most numerous animals, and they play an essential role in the marine trophic web and biogeochemical cycles. The genus Oithona is described as having the highest density of copepods. The Oithona male paradox describes the activity states of males, which are obliged to alternate between immobile and mobile phases for ambush feeding and mate searching, respectively, while the female is less mobile and feeds less. To characterize the molecular basis of this sexual dimorphism, we combined immunofluorescence, genomics, transcriptomics, and protein-protein interaction approaches and revealed the presence of a male-specific nervous ganglion. Transcriptomic analysis showed male-specific enrichment for nervous system development-related transcripts. Twenty-seven Lin12-Notch Repeat domain-containing protein coding genes (LDPGs) of the 75 LDPGs identified in the genome were specifically expressed in males. Furthermore, some LDPGs coded for proteins with predicted proteolytic activity, and proteases-associated transcripts showed a male-specific enrichment. Using yeast double-hybrid assays, we constructed a protein-protein interaction network involving two LDPs with proteases, extracellular matrix proteins, and neurogenesis-related proteins. We also hypothesized possible roles of the LDPGs in the development of the lateral ganglia through helping in extracellular matrix lysis, neurites growth guidance, and synapses genesis.",2021,"copepods; sexual differentiation; nervous system; lin12-notch-repeat; oithona; protein-protein interaction","Article","ISI"
"Fine Mapping to Identify the Functional Genetic Locus for Red Coloration inPyropia yezoensisThallus","10.3389/fpls.2020.00867","Yu, XZ; Wang, L; Xu, KP; Kong, FN; Wang, DM; Tang, XH; Sun, B; Mao, YX","Pyropia yezoensis, commonly known as Nori or Laver is an economically important marine crop. In natural or selected populations ofP. yezoensis, coloration mutants are frequently observed. Various coloration mutants are excellent materials for genetic research and study photosynthesis. However, the candidate gene controlling thePyropiacoloration phenotype remains unclear to date. QTL-seq, in combination with kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) and RNA-seq, can be generally applied to population genomics studies to rapidly identify genes that are responsible for phenotypes showing extremely opposite traits. Through cross experiments between the wild line RZ and red-mutant HT, offsprings with 1-4 sectors chimeric blade were generated. Statistical analyses revealed that the red thallus coloration phenotype is conferred by a single nuclear allele. Two-pair populations, consisting of 24 and 56 wild-type/red-type single-genotype sectors from F1 progeny, were used in QTL-seq to detect a genomic region inP. yezoensisharboring the red coloration locus. Based on a high-quality genome, we first identified the candidate region within a 3.30-Mb region at the end of chromosome 1. Linkage map-based QTL analysis was used to confirm the candidate region identified by QTL-seq. Then, four KASP markers developed in this region were used to narrow down the candidate region to a 1.42-Mb region. Finally, we conducted RNA-seq to focus on 13 differentially expressed genes and further predictedrcl-1, which contains one non-synonymous SNP [A/C] in the coding region that could be regulating red thallus coloration inP. yezoensis. Our results provide novel insights into the underlying mechanism controlling blade coloration, which is a desirable trait in algae.",2020,"pyropia yezoensis; mutant; red coloration; qtl-seq; kasp; rna-seq; fine mapping","Article","ISI"

Important factors influencing their distribution include light and temperature but the molecular basis of kelp responses to these factors is poorly understood. We therefore constructed a comprehensive cDNA library from RNA sampled under various light and temperature regimes, as a basis for future studies about the mechanisms and pathways involved in acclimation to light and temperature stress in Saccharina latissima. A total of 400 503 ESTs was assembled into 28 803 contigs. We were able to assign putative functions or orthology relationships to more than 10 000 contigs by BLASTx, Interpro protein-motif annotation, or Gene Ontology (GO). The most frequent Interpro protein domains found in the cDNA library were the protein kinase-like domain, serine/threonine-protein kinase-like domain, and NAD(P)-binding and thioredoxin-like fold domain. Enzyme code (EC) annotation yielded attributions for 480 contigs, providing a total of 625 ECs, which could be mapped to 85 biochemical pathways. Comparative genomics of S. latissima and Ectocarpus siliculosus indicated that our cDNA library gave a genome coverage of approximately 70%, assuming similar gene numbers in both species. GO term occurrence in S. latissima and E. siliculosus showed a similar distribution pattern among the root ontologies biological process, molecular function and cellular component. Comparative protein domain annotation of S. latissima und E. siliculosus showed that, probably due to the chosen stress conditions, the domains 'thioredoxin fold', 'thioredoxin-like fold', 'heat shock protein 70', and 'bromoperoxidase/chloroperoxidase C-terminal' are over-represented in the cDNA library.",2012,"cdna library; est; kelp; laminaria saccharina; light acclimation; macroalgae; phaeophyceae; saccharina latissima; rna extraction; temperature stress","Article","ISI"

While, on average, more than one-tenth of protein N-termini are incorrectly annotated, there is a crucial need for methodological approaches to systematically establish the translational starts of polypeptides, and their maturations, such as N-terminal methionine processing and peptide signal excision. Refinement of genome annotation through correction of wrongly annotation initiation start site and detection of unannotated genes can be achieved after enrichment and detection of protein N-termini by mass spectrometry. Here we describe a straightforward strategy to specifically label protein N-termini with a positively charged TMPP label to selectively capture these entities with in-house-developed anti-TMPP antibodies coupled to magnetic beads and to analyze them by nanoLC-MS/MS. While most N-terminomics-oriented approaches are based on the depletion of internal peptides to retrieve N-terminal peptides, this enrichment approach is fast and the results are highly specific for improved, ionizable, TMPP-labeled peptides. The whole proteome of the model marine bacterium, Roseobacter denitrificans, was analyzed, leading to the identification of more than twice the number of N-terminal peptides compared with the nonenriched fraction. A total of 269 proteins were characterized in terms of their N-termini. In addition, three unannotated genes were identified based on multiple, redundant N-terminal peptides. Our strategy greatly simplifies the systematic and automatic proteogenomic annotation of genomes as well as degradomics-oriented approaches, focusing the mass spectrometric efforts on the most crucial enriched fractions.",2014,"proteogenomics; genome annotation; n-terminomics; high-throughput proteomics; protein derivatization; tandem mass spectrometry","Article","ISI"

Here we investigate the extent to which gene flow occurs between fragmented populations of the deep-water brown algae Ericaria zosteroides (Turner) Greville (Sargassaceae, Fucales). These investigations were performed at different spatial scales from the bay of Marseille (western Provence) to Corsica. As dispersal of zygotes is shown to be limited over distances beyond a few meters, we used a multidisciplinary approach, based on Lagrangian modeling and population genomics to test the hypothesis that drifting of fertile parts of thallus (eggs on fertile branches), mediated by ocean currents, enable occasional gene flow between populations. Therefore we assessed the respective contribution of oceanographic connectivity, geographical isolation, and seawater temperatures to the genetic structure of this species. The genetic structure was assessed using 10,755 neutral SNPs and 12 outlier SNPs genotyped by dd-RAD sequencing in 261 individuals of E. zosteroides. We find that oceanographic connectivity is the best predictor of genetic structure, while differentiation in outlier SNPs can be explained by the depth of populations, as emphasized by the minimum seawater temperature predictor. However, further investigations will be necessary for clarifying how depth drives adaptive genetic differentiation in E. zosteroides. Our analyses revealed that local hydrodynamic conditions are correlated with the very high divergence of one population in the Bay of Marseille. Overall, the levels of gene flow mediated by drifting were certainly not sufficient to counteract differentiation by local genetic drift, but enough to allow colonization several kilometers away. This study stresses the need to consider secondary dispersal mechanisms of presumed low dispersal marine species to improve inference of population connectivity.",2021,"connectivity; fucales; mediterranean; marine forest; population genomics; lagrangian modelling; dispersal; gene flow","Article","ISI"

In this study, we provide a high-quality chromosome-level genome assembled using Pacific Bioscience long reads and Hi-C-based and linkage-map-based scaffolding technologies and a high-resolution variation map constructed using large-scale resequencing analysis. The 586.8 Mb genome consists of 10 pseudochromosome sequences ranging from 38.6 to 78.9 Mb, containing 301 contigs with an N50 size of 3.1 Mb. A total of 30,078 protein-coding genes were predicted, of which 22,757 (75.7%) were high-reliability annotations supported by a homologous match to a curated protein in the SWISS-PROT database or transcript expression. Although a medium level of repeat components (57.2%) was detected, the genomic content of the segmental duplications reached 26.2%, which is the highest among the reported genomes. By whole genome resequencing analysis of 495 Pacific oysters, a comprehensive variation map was built, comprised of 4.78 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 0.60 million short insertions and deletions, and 49,333 copy number variation regions. The structural variations can lead to an average interindividual genomic divergence of 0.21, indicating their crucial role in shaping the Pacific oyster genome diversity. The large amount of mosaic distributed repeat elements, small variations, and copy number variations indicate that the Pacific oyster is a diploid organism with an extremely high genomic complexity at the intra- and interindividual level.

We investigated the global population genomics of tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier), a circumglobally distributed, apex predator displaying remarkable behavioral versatility in its diet, habitat use (near coastal, coral reef, pelagic), and individual movement patterns (spatially resident to long-distance migrations). We genotyped 242 tiger sharks from 10 globally distributed locations at more than 2000 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Although this species often conducts massive distance migrations, the data show strong genetic differentiation at both neutral (FST = 0.125-0.144) and candidate outlier loci (F-ST = 0.570-0.761) between western Atlantic and Indo-Pacific sharks, suggesting the potential for adaptation to the environments specific to these oceanic regions. Within these regions, there was mixed support for population differentiation between northern and southern hemispheres in the western Atlantic, and none for structure within the Indian Ocean. Notably, the results demonstrate a low level of population differentiation of tiger sharks from the remote Hawaiian archipelago compared with sharks from the Indian Ocean (F-ST = 0.003-0.005, P < 0.01). Given concerns about biodiversity loss and marine ecosystem impacts caused by overfishing of oceanic sharks in the midst of rapid environmental change, our results suggest it imperative that international fishery management prioritize conservation of the evolutionary potential of the highly genetically differentiated Atlantic and Indo-Pacific populations of this unique apex predator.

Significant recent progress in long-read sequencing technologies such as PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) has also brought about a large variety of assemblers. Although these have been extensively tested on model species such as Homo sapiens and Drosophila melanogaster, such benchmarking has not been done in Mollusca, which lacks widely adopted model species. Molluscan genomes are notoriously rich in repeats and are often highly heterozygous, making their assembly challenging. Here, we benchmarked 10 assemblers based on ONT raw reads from two published molluscan genomes of differing properties, the gastropod Chrysomallon squamiferum (356.6 Mb, 1.59% heterozygosity) and the bivalve Mytilus coruscus (1593 Mb, 1.94% heterozygosity). By optimizing the assembly pipeline, we greatly improved both genomes from previously published versions. Our results suggested that 40-50X of ONT reads are sufficient for high-quality genomes, with Flye being the recommended assembler for compact and less heterozygous genomes exemplified by C. squamiferum, while NextDenovo excelled for more repetitive and heterozygous molluscan genomes exemplified by M. coruscus. A phylogenomic analysis using the two updated genomes with 32 other published high-quality lophotrochozoan genomes resulted in maximum support across all nodes, and we show that improved genome quality also leads to more complete matrices for phylogenomic inferences.

Byssal threads composed of many proteins extend like tendons from muscle cells, ending in adhesive pads that attach underwater. Crucial to settlement and metamorphosis, larvae of virtually all species are byssate. By contrast, in adults, the byssus is scattered throughout bivalves, where it has had profound effects on morphological evolution and been key to adaptive radiations of epifaunal species. I compare byssus structure and proteins in blue mussels (Mytilus), by far the best characterized, to zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha), in which several byssal proteins have been isolated and sequenced. By mapping the adult byssus onto a recent phylogenomic tree, I confirm its independent evolution in these and other lineages, likely parallelisms with common origins in development. While the byssus is superficially similar in Dreissena and Mytilus, in finer detail it is not, and byssal proteins are dramatically different. I used the chromosome-scale D. polymorpha genome we recently assembled to search for byssal genes and found 37 byssal loci on 10 of the 16 chromosomes. Most byssal genes are in small families, with several amino acid substitutions between paralogs. Byssal proteins of zebra mussels and related quagga mussels (D. rostriformis) are divergent, suggesting rapid evolution typical of proteins with repetitive low complexity domains. Opportunities abound for proteomic and genomic work to further our understanding of this textbook example of a marine natural material. A priority should be invasive bivalves, given the role of byssal attachment in the spread of, and ecological and economic damage caused by zebra mussels, quagga mussels and others.

E sp. EZ's life history traits (e.g., large population sizes, large reproductive clutches, and long life spans), in theory, should homogenize populations unless nonneutral processes are occurring. Here, we generated a draft genome and a restriction site-associated DNA sequencing data set from seven populations along an environmental gradient across the Persian/Arabian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. The estimated genome size of E. sp. EZ was 609 Mb and the heterozygosity was among the highest recorded for an echinoderm at 4.5%.

Among those, copy number variants (CNVs), including duplicated genomic regions and transposable elements (TEs), may contribute to local adaptation and/or reproductive isolation among divergent populations. Those mechanisms suppose that CNVs could be used to infer neutral and/or adaptive population genetic structure, whose study has been restricted to microsatellites, mitochondrial DNA and Amplified fragment length polymorphism markers in the past and more recently the use of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Taking advantage of recent developments allowing CNV analysis from RAD-seq data, we investigated how variation in fitness-related traits, local environmental conditions and demographic history are associated with CNVs, and how subsequent copy number variation drives population genetic structure in a marine fish, the capelin (Mallotus villosus). We collected 1538 DNA samples from 35 sampling sites in the north Atlantic Ocean and identified 6620 putative CNVs. We found associations between CNVs and the gonadosomatic index, suggesting that six duplicated regions could affect female fitness by modulating oocyte production. We also detected 105 CNV candidates associated with water temperature, among which 20% corresponded to genomic regions located within the sequence of protein-coding genes, suggesting local adaptation to cold water by means of gene sequence amplification. We also identified 175 CNVs associated with the divergence of three previously defined parapatric glacial lineages, of which 24% were located within protein-coding genes, making those loci potential candidates for reproductive isolation. Lastly, our analyses unveiled a hierarchical, complex CNV population structure determined by temperature and local geography, which was in stark contrast to that inferred based on SNPs in a previous study.

We compared gene copy concentrations, in gene copies per mass of sample, of five antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) generated with (i) our quantitative metagenomic approach, (ii) targeted qPCR, and (iii) a hybrid quantification approach involving metagenomics and qPCR-based 16S rRNA gene quantification. Although qPCR achieved lower quantification limits, the metagenomic method avoided biases caused by primer specificity inherent to qPCRbased methods and was able to detect orders of magnitude more genes than is possible with qPCR assays. We used the approach to simultaneously quantify ARGs in the Comprehensive Antimicrobial Resistance Database (CARD). We observed that the total abundance of tetracycline resistance genes was consistent across different stages of manure treatment on three farms, but different samples were dominated by different tetracycline resistance gene families. IMPORTANCE qPCR and metagenomics are central molecular techniques that have offered insights into biological processes for decades, from monitoring spatial and temporal gene dynamics to tracking ARGs or pathogens. Still needed is a tool that can quantify thousands of relevant genes in a sample as gene copies per sample mass or volume. We compare a quantitative metagenomic approach with traditional qPCR approaches in the quantification of ARG targets in dairy manure samples. By leveraging the benefits of nontargeted community genomics, we demonstrate high-throughput absolute gene quantification of all known ARG sequences in environmental samples.",2021,"antimicrobial resistance; gene quantification; metagenomics","Article","ISI"
"Long-read viral metagenomics captures abundant and microdiverse viral populations and their niche-defining genomic islands","10.7717/peerj.6800","Warwick-Dugdale, J; Solonenko, N; Moore, K; Chittick, L; Gregory, AC; Allen, MJ; Sullivan, MB; Temperton, B","Marine viruses impact global biogeochemical cycles via their influence on host community structure and function, yet our understanding of viral ecology is constrained by limitations in host culturing and a lack of reference genomes and 'universal' gene markers to facilitate community surveys. Short-read viral metagenomic studies have provided clues to viral function and first estimates of global viral gene abundance and distribution, but their assemblies are confounded by populations with high levels of strain evenness and nucleotide diversity (microdiversity), limiting assembly of some of the most abundant viruses on Earth. Such features also challenge assembly across genomic islands containing niche-defining genes that drive ecological speciation. These populations and features may be successfully captured by single-virus genomics and fosmid-based approaches, at least in abundant taxa, but at considerable cost and technical expertise. Here we established a low-cost, low-input, high throughput alternative sequencing and informatics workflow to improve viral metagenomic assemblies using short-read and long-read technology. The 'VirION' (Viral, long-read metagenomics via MinION sequencing) approach was first validated using mock communities where it was found to be as relatively quantitative as short-read methods and provided significant improvements in recovery of viral genomes. We then then applied VirION to the first metagenome from a natural viral community from the Western English Channel. In comparison to a short-read only approach, VirION: (i) increased number and completeness of assembled viral genomes; (ii) captured abundant, highly microdiverse virus populations, and (iii) captured more and longer genomic islands. Together, these findings suggest that VirION provides a high throughput and cost-effective alternative to fosmid and single-virus genomic approaches to more comprehensively explore viral communities in nature.",2019,"viral metagenomics; virus; virome; metagenome; assembly; viral ecology; long-read sequencing; marine microbiology","Article","ISI"
"Novel insights into the Thaumarchaeota in the deepest oceans: their metabolism and potential adaptation mechanisms","10.1186/s40168-020-00849-2","Zhong, HH; Lehtovirta-Morley, L; Liu, JW; Zheng, YF; Lin, HY; Song, DL; Todd, JD; Tian, JW; Zhang, XH","Background: Marine Group I (MGI) Thaumarchaeota, which play key roles in the global biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen and carbon (ammonia oxidizers), thrive in the aphotic deep sea with massive populations. Recent studies have revealed that MGI Thaumarchaeota were present in the deepest part of oceans-the hadal zone (depth > 6000 m, consisting almost entirely of trenches), with the predominant phylotype being distinct from that in the shallower deep sea. However, little is known about the metabolism and distribution of these ammonia oxidizers in the hadal water. Results: In this study, metagenomic data were obtained from 0-10,500 m deep seawater samples from the Mariana Trench. The distribution patterns of Thaumarchaeota derived from metagenomics and 16S rRNA gene sequencing were in line with that reported in previous studies: abundance of Thaumarchaeota peaked in bathypelagic zone (depth 1000-4000 m) and the predominant clade shifted in the hadal zone. Several metagenome-assembled thaumarchaeotal genomes were recovered, including a near-complete one representing the dominant hadal phylotype of MGI. Using comparative genomics, we predict that unexpected genes involved in bioenergetics, including two distinct ATP synthase genes (predicted to be coupled with H+ and Na+ respectively), and genes horizontally transferred from other extremophiles, such as those encoding putative di-myo-inositol-phosphate (DIP) synthases, might significantly contribute to the success of this hadal clade under the extreme condition. We also found that hadal MGI have the genetic potential to import a far higher range of organic compounds than their shallower water counterparts. Despite this trait, hadal MDI ammonia oxidation and carbon fixation genes are highly transcribed providing evidence they are likely autotrophic, contributing to the primary production in the aphotic deep sea. Conclusions: Our study reveals potentially novel adaptation mechanisms of deep-sea thaumarchaeotal clades and suggests key functions of deep-sea Thaumarchaeota in carbon and nitrogen cycling.",2020,"thaumarchaeota; mariana trench; hadal zone; metagenomics; comparative genomics; sodium bioenergetics","Article","ISI"
"Natal Origin Identification of Green Turtles in the North Pacific by Genome-Wide Population Analysis With Limited DNA Samples","10.3389/fmars.2020.00658","Hamabata, T; Matsuo, A; Sato, MP; Kondo, S; Kameda, K; Kawazu, I; Fukuoka, T; Sato, K; Suyama, Y; Kawata, M","Although studies using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are growing in non-model species, it is still difficult to prepare sufficient high-quality genomic DNA (gDNA) for population genomic analyses in many wild species. In this study, we first analyzed the population structure of green turtles in the North Pacific; four regions in Japan (the Yaeyama, Okinawa, Amami, and Ogasawara Islands), the Southeast Asia, Taiwan, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic Marshall Islands, and the Central or Eastern Pacific (C/E Pacific) using similar or equal to 1 ng of gDNA from green turtle field samples - including ones from dead carcasses - and multiplexed inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) genotyping by sequencing (MIG-seq). In addition, we explored whether the genome-wide SNP data narrowed down the natal origins of foraging turtles that were difficult to identify by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotype alone. The overall nesting population structure observed from genome-wide SNPs was consistent with results from mtDNA, and the population isolation of the C/E Pacific and Ogasawara Islands from the other North Pacific populations was highlighted. However, the population boundaries among the Northwestern Pacific, other than those of the Ogasawaras, were not clear. The uniqueness of the Ogasawara population in genome-wide SNP data enabled the identification of turtles that were more likely to have been born on the Ogasawara Islands. Our results show that genome-wide SNP data are more practical in identifying the natal origins of turtles that were difficult determine by the conventional mtDNA-basis mixed stock analysis. This study also showed that MIG-seq can be expected to meet the potential demand to utilize many preserved or fragmented gDNA samples for population genomics in many marine megafaunas for which sample collections are difficult.",2020,"marine turtle; population genomics; field sample; mig-seq; natal origin identification","Article","ISI"
"Habitat discontinuities form strong barriers to gene flow among mangrove populations, despite the capacity for long-distance dispersal","10.1111/ddi.12851","Binks, RM; Byrne, M; McMahon, K; Pitt, G; Murray, K; Evans, RD","Aim Mangrove forests are among the world's most important ecosystems but are declining rapidly worldwide. Effective conservation management requires a better understanding of the patterns and drivers of gene flow across a range of spatial scales. Despite the capacity for long-distance propagule dispersal, field studies suggest that mangrove propagules tend not to disperse far from the release point, which has important implications for the impact of habitat discontinuities on gene flow. We use a comprehensive seascape genomics approach to investigate this concept in the world's most widely distributed mangrove species, Avicennia marina. Location Twenty-one sites along 2,400 km of Western Australian coastline. Methods We used 6,162 neutral SNP loci and a hierarchical sampling design to investigate patterns of gene flow and structuring among 21 populations of A. marina. We combined these data with GIS spatial analyses in a regression model to test the relative influence of habitat continuity and geographic distance on patterns of genetic differentiation. Results We found a complex pattern of gene flow; broadscale isolation-by-distance, disrupted by strong genetic discontinuities that coincided with gaps in mangrove distribution. These genetic discontinuities formed seven discrete subpopulations with negligible evidence for recent migration among them. The regression model combining marine geographic distance and habitat continuity as explanatory variables best fit the data, explaining 86% of the total genetic variation. Main Conclusions Our results validate previous assertions that propagule dispersal in A. marina is spatially limited and demonstrate that significant gaps in mangrove distribution present strong barriers to stepping-stone gene flow in this species. This reiterates that dispersive life history features cannot be assumed to lead to widespread connectivity and demonstrates that effective management of these important ecosystem builders should prioritize restoring habitat continuity and minimizing further fragmentation.",2019,"avicennia marina; genotyping-by-sequencing; habitat discontinuities; mangrove; marine connectivity; propagule dispersal; seascape genomics","Article","ISI"
"Genome-wide identification of nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily genes in the copepod Tigriopus japonicus","10.1186/1471-2164-15-993","Hwang, DS; Lee, BY; Kim, HS; Lee, MC; Kyung, H; Om, AS; Rhee, JS; Lee, JS","Background: Nuclear receptors (NRs) are a large superfamily of proteins defined by a DNA-binding domain (DBD) and a ligand-binding domain (LBD). They function as transcriptional regulators to control expression of genes involved in development, homeostasis, and metabolism. The number of NRs differs from species to species, because of gene duplications and/or lineage-specific gene losses during metazoan evolution. Many NRs in arthropods interact with the ecdysteroid hormone and are involved in ecdysone-mediated signaling in arthropods. The nuclear receptor superfamily complement has been reported in several arthropods, including crustaceans, but not in copepods. We identified the entire NR repertoire of the copepod Tigriopus japonicus, which is an important marine model species for ecotoxicology and environmental genomics. Results: Using whole genome and transcriptome sequences, we identified a total of 31 nuclear receptors in the genome of T. japonicus. Nomenclature of the nuclear receptors was determined based on the sequence similarities of the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and ligand-binding domain (LBD). The 7 subfamilies of NRs separate into five major clades (subfamilies NR1, NR2, NR3, NR4, and NR5/6). Although the repertoire of NR members in, T. japonicus was similar to that reported for other arthropods, there was an expansion of the NR1 subfamily in Tigriopus japonicus. The twelve unique nuclear receptors identified in T. japonicus are members of NR1L. This expansion may be a unique lineage-specific feature of crustaceans. Interestingly, E78 and HR83, which are present in other arthropods, were absent from the genomes of T. japonicus and two congeneric copepod species (T. japonicus and Tigriopus californicus), suggesting copepod lineage-specific gene loss. Conclusions: We identified all NR receptors present in the copepod, T. japonicus. Knowledge of the copepod nuclear receptor repertoire will contribute to a better understanding of copepod-and crustacean-specific NR evolution.",2014,"nuclear receptor; copepod; ecdysone signaling","Article","ISI"
"A COMPARATIVE STUDY ON METALS AND PARASITES IN SHELLFISH OF FRESHWATER AND MARINE ECOSYSTEMS","10.2983/035.040.0313","Urdes, L; Alcivar-Warren, A","Little has been published about the interactions of metals and parasites in economically important aquaculture species, particularly shellfish. Metal bioaccumulation and parasitic diseases could vary in different species depending on temperature changes and other environmental factors. Most studies conducted on endoparasites, such as acanthocephalans, cestodes, nematodes, and trematodes, indicate that only cestodes and acanthocephalans could absorb heavy metals successfully in their hosts, and that only adult worms could be used as indicators of environmental pollution. In Artemia parthenogenetica, cestodes increased resistance to arsenic (As) pollution and temperature changes; and infection was associated with improved antioxidant defense system without oxidative damage. The most serious parasite of Penaeus spp. is Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (Microsporidia: Enterocytozoonidae). Apostome ciliates are negatively impacting Pandalus borealis of the northeastern United States (Synophrya sp. that causes white eggs or Black Spot Gill Syndrome) and Penaeus spp. from the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico (Hyalophysa lynni that causes shrimp black gill). In freshwater fish, the larvae of the nematode Eustrongylides spp. Jagerskiold, 1909 (Nematoda: Dioctophymidae) absorbed lead (Pb), mercury, and cadmium, when the metal levels were close to zero in water and sediment. The concentration of Pb in the larvae was approximately 17 times higher than in the fish. Like the antioxidant defense reactions in the parasitized A. parthenogenetica exposed to As, an improved antioxidant defense system may be available in parasitized fish, limiting oxidative damage caused by metals. This study presents baseline concentrations of 30 metals in wild Penaeus vannamei Boone, 1931 from Ecuador and other species, as well as the current taxonomy for selected shellfish species and their parasites. Research is needed to assess the relationship of metals in parasites and host tissues, and oxidative stress in shellfish. The tools of One Health including molecular ecology, population genomics, proteomics, and epigenetic epidemiology should be used to detect parasites and environmental pollution indicators that could threaten aquatic species from freshwater and marine ecosystems, particularly considering climate change and pollution threats.",2021,"parasites; metals; eustrongylides spp. larvae; penaeus spp.; pandalus borealis; crassostrea virginica; crassostrea gigas; shrimp black gill; hyalophysa lynni; black spot gill syndrome; synophrya sp.; enterocytozoon hepatopenaei; haplosporidium nelsoni; perkinsus marinus; pollution indicators","Article","ISI"
"Novel genomic resources for shelled pteropods: a draft genome and target capture probes for Limacina bulimoides, tested for cross-species relevance","10.1186/s12864-019-6372-z","Choo, L; Bal, TMP; Choquet, M; Smolina, I; Ramos-Silva, P; Marletaz, F; Kopp, M; Hoarau, G; Peijnenburg, KTCA","Background Pteropods are planktonic gastropods that are considered as bio-indicators to monitor impacts of ocean acidification on marine ecosystems. In order to gain insight into their adaptive potential to future environmental changes, it is critical to use adequate molecular tools to delimit species and population boundaries and to assess their genetic connectivity. We developed a set of target capture probes to investigate genetic variation across their large-sized genome using a population genomics approach. Target capture is less limited by DNA amount and quality than other genome-reduced representation protocols, and has the potential for application on closely related species based on probes designed from one species. Results We generated the first draft genome of a pteropod, Limacina bulimoides, resulting in a fragmented assembly of 2.9 Gbp. Using this assembly and a transcriptome as a reference, we designed a set of 2899 genome-wide target capture probes for L. bulimoides. The set of probes includes 2812 single copy nuclear targets, the 28S rDNA sequence, ten mitochondrial genes, 35 candidate biomineralisation genes, and 41 non-coding regions. The capture reaction performed with these probes was highly efficient with 97% of the targets recovered on the focal species. A total of 137,938 single nucleotide polymorphism markers were obtained from the captured sequences across a test panel of nine individuals. The probes set was also tested on four related species: L. trochiformis, L. lesueurii, L. helicina, and Heliconoides inflatus, showing an exponential decrease in capture efficiency with increased genetic distance from the focal species. Sixty-two targets were sufficiently conserved to be recovered consistently across all five species. Conclusion The target capture protocol used in this study was effective in capturing genome-wide variation in the focal species L. bulimoides, suitable for population genomic analyses, while providing insights into conserved genomic regions in related species. The present study provides new genomic resources for pteropods and supports the use of target capture-based protocols to efficiently characterise genomic variation in small non-model organisms with large genomes.",2020,"targeted sequencing; exon capture; genome; non-model organism; marine zooplankton","Article","ISI"
"A first generation BAC-based physical map of the half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis) genome","10.1186/1471-2164-15-215","Zhang, JJ; Shao, CW; Zhang, LY; Liu, K; Gao, FT; Dong, ZD; Xu, P; Chen, SL","Background: Half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis Gunther) has been exploited as a commercially important cultured marine flatfish, and female grows 2-3 times faster than male. Genetic studies, especially on the chromosomal sex-determining system of this species, have been carried out in the last decade. Although the genome of half-smooth tongue sole was relatively small (626.9 Mb), there are still some difficulties in the high-quality assembly of the next generation genome sequencing reads without the assistance of a physical map, especially for the W chromosome of this fish due to abundance of repetitive sequences. The objective of this study is to construct a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-based physical map for half-smooth tongue sole with the method of high information content fingerprinting (HICF). Results: A physical map of half-smooth tongue sole was constructed with 30, 294 valid fingerprints (7.5 x genome coverage) with a tolerance of 4 and an initial cutoff of 1e-60. A total of 29,709 clones were assembled into 1,485 contigs with an average length of 539 kb and a N50 length of 664 kb. There were 394 contigs longer than the N50 length, and these contigs will be a useful resource for future integration with linkage map and whole genome sequence assembly. The estimated physical length of the assembled contigs was 797 Mb, representing approximately 1.27 coverage of the half-smooth tongue sole genome. The largest contig contained 410 BAC clones with a physical length of 3.48 Mb. Almost all of the 676 BAC clones (99.9%) in the 21 randomly selected contigs were positively validated by PCR assays, thereby confirming the reliability of the assembly. Conclusions: A first generation BAC-based physical map of half-smooth tongue sole was constructed with high reliability. The map will promote genetic improvement programs of this fish, especially integration of physical and genetic maps, fine-mappings of important gene and/or QTL, comparative and evolutionary genomics studies, as well as whole genome sequence assembly.",2014,"half-smooth tongue sole; cynoglossus semilaevis; bac library; physical map; genome","Article","ISI"

Although many studies have examined the ecological effects of heat stress on mussels, little is known about the physiological mechanisms that maybe affected by co-exposure to heat stress and environmental contaminants such as nickel (Ni). In the present work, we investigated the effects of simultaneous changes in temperature and Ni supply on lysosomal membrane stability (LMS) and malondialdehyde accumulation (MDA) in the digestive gland (DG) of the blue mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis (Lam.). To elucidate how the molecular response to environmental stressors is modulated, we employed a cDNA microarray with 1673 sequences to measure relative transcript abundances in the DG of mussels exposed to Ni along with a temperature increase. A two-way ANOVA revealed that temperature and Ni rendered additive effects on LMS and MDA accumulation, increasing the toxic effects of metal cations. Ni loads in the DG were also affected by co-exposure to 26 degrees C. In animals exposed only to heat stress, functional genomics analysis of the microarray data (171differentially expressed genes (DEGs)) highlighted seven biological processes, largely dominated by the up-regulation of folding protein-related genes and the down-regulation of genes involved in cell migration and cellular component assembly. Exposure to Ni at 18 degrees C and 26 degrees C yielded 188 and 262 DEGs, respectively, exhibiting distinct patterns in terms of biological processes. In particular, the response of mussels exposed to Ni at 26 degrees C was characterized by the up-regulation of proteolysis, ribosome biogenesis, response to unfolded proteins, and catabolic-related genes, as well as the down-regulation of genes encoding cellular metabolic processes. Our data provide new insights into the transcriptomic response in mussels experiencing temperature increases and Ni exposure; these data should be carefully considered in view of the biological effects of heat stress, particularly in polluted areas.

Specific interest is shown towards those metabolites that exhibit antimicrobial activities against multidrug-resistant bacteria that have become a global health threat. Genera of the phylum Firmicutes are frequently identified as sources of such metabolites, but the biosynthetic potential of its Virgibacillus genus is not known. Here, we used comparative genomic analysis to determine whether Virgibacillus strains isolated from the Red Sea mangrove mud in Rabigh Harbor Lagoon, Saudi Arabia, may be an attractive source of such novel antimicrobial agents. Results A comparative genomics analysis based on Virgibacillus dokdonensis Bac330, Virgibacillus sp. Bac332 and Virgibacillus halodenitrificans Bac324 (isolated from the Red Sea) and six other previously reported Virgibacillus strains was performed. Orthology analysis was used to determine the core genomes as well as the accessory genome of the nine Virgibacillus strains. The analysis shows that the Red Sea strain Virgibacillus sp. Bac332 has the highest number of unique genes and genomic islands compared to other genomes included in this study. Focusing on biosynthetic gene clusters, we show how marine isolates, including those from the Red Sea, are more enriched with nonribosomal peptides compared to the other Virgibacillus species. We also found that most nonribosomal peptide synthases identified in the Virgibacillus strains are part of genomic regions that are potentially horizontally transferred. Conclusions The Red Sea Virgibacillus strains have a large number of biosynthetic genes in clusters that are not assigned to known products, indicating significant potential for the discovery of novel bioactive compounds. Also, having more modular synthetase units suggests that these strains are good candidates for experimental characterization of previously identified bioactive compounds as well.

"Comparative Genomics of Typical and Atypical Aeromonas salmonicida Complete Genomes Revealed New Insights into Pathogenesis Evolution","10.3390/microorganisms10010189","Vasquez, I; Hossain, A; Gnanagobal, H; Valderrama, K; Campbell, B; Ness, M; Charette, SJ; Gamperl, AK; Cipriano, R; Segovia, C; Santander, J","Aeromonas salmonicida is a global distributed Gram-negative teleost pathogen, affecting mainly salmonids in fresh and marine environments. A. salmonicida strains are classified as typical or atypical depending on their origin of isolation and phenotype. Five subspecies have been described, where A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida is the only typical subspecies, and the subsp. achromogenes, masoucida, smithia, and pectinolytica are considered atypical. Genomic differences between A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida isolates and their relationship with the current classification have not been explored. Here, we sequenced and compared the complete closed genomes of four virulent strains to elucidate their molecular diversity and pathogenic evolution using the more accurate genomic information so far. Phenotypes, biochemical, and enzymatic profiles were determined. PacBio and MiSeq sequencing platforms were utilized for genome sequencing. Comparative genomics showed that atypical strains belong to the subsp. salmonicida, with 99.55% +/- 0.25% identity with each other, and are closely related to typical strains. The typical strain A. salmonicida J223 is closely related to typical strains, with 99.17% identity with the A. salmonicida A449. Genomic differences between atypical and typical strains are strictly related to insertion sequences (ISs) activity. The absence and presence of genes encoding for virulence factors, transcriptional regulators, and non-coding RNAs are the most significant differences between typical and atypical strains that affect their phenotypes. Plasmidome plays an important role in A. salmonicida virulence and genome plasticity. Here, we determined that typical strains harbor a larger number of plasmids and virulence-related genes that contribute to its acute virulence. In contrast, atypical strains harbor a single, large plasmid and a smaller number of virulence genes, reflected by their less acute virulence and chronic infection. The relationship between phenotype and A. salmonicida subspecies' taxonomy is not evident. Comparative genomic analysis based on completed genomes revealed that the subspecies classification is more of a reflection of the ecological niche occupied by bacteria than their divergences at the genomic level except for their accessory genome.",2022,"aeromonas salmonicida; genomics; taxonomy; virulence; plasmidome; insertion sequences","Article","ISI"

The polymer is also synthesized as an exo-polysaccharide by bacteria belonging to the genera Pseudomonas and Azotobacter, and these organisms may represent an alternative alginate source in the future. The current work describes an attempt to rationally develop a biological system tuned for very high levels of alginate production, based on a fundamental understanding of the system through metabolic modeling supported by transcriptomics studies and carefully controlled fermentations. Results: Alginate biosynthesis in Pseudomonas fluorescens was studied in a genomics perspective, using an alginate over-producing strain carrying a mutation in the anti-sigma factor gene mucA. Cells were cultivated in chemostats under nitrogen limitation on fructose or glycerol as carbon sources, and cell mass, growth rate, sugar uptake, alginate and CO2 production were monitored. In addition a genome scale metabolic model was constructed and samples were collected for transcriptome analyses. The analyses show that polymer production operates in a close to optimal way with respect to stoichiometric utilization of the carbon source and that the cells increase the uptake of carbon source to compensate for the additional needs following from alginate synthesis. The transcriptome studies show that in the presence of the mucA mutation, the alg operon is upregulated together with genes involved in energy generation, genes on both sides of the succinate node of the TCA cycle and genes encoding ribosomal and other translation-related proteins. Strains expressing a functional MucA protein (no alginate production) synthesize cellular biomass in an inefficient way, apparently due to a cycle that involves oxidation of NADPH without ATP production. The results of this study indicate that the most efficient way of using a mucA mutant as a cell factory for alginate production would be to use non-growing conditions and nitrogen deprivation. Conclusions: The insights gained in this study should be very useful for a future efficient production of microbial alginates.",2013,"pseudomonas; polysaccharide; alginate; genome-scale metabolic modeling","Article","ISI"
"Determination of the Side-Reaction Coefficient of Desferrioxamine B in Trace-Metal-Free Seawater","10.3389/fmars.2016.00117","Schijf, J; Burns, SM","Electrochemical techniques like adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetry with competitive ligand equilibration (ACSV-CLE) can determine total concentrations of marine organic ligands and their conditional binding constants for specific metals, but cannot identify them. Individual organic ligands, isolated from microbial cultures or biosynthesized through genomics, can be structurally characterized via NMR and tandem MS analysis, but this is tedious and time-consuming. A complementary approach is to compare known properties of natural ligands, particularly their conditional binding constants, with those of model organic ligands, measured under suitable conditions. Such comparisons cannot be meaningfully interpreted unless the side-reaction coefficient (SRC) of the model ligand in seawater is thoroughly evaluated. We conducted series of potentiometric titrations, in non-coordinating medium at seawater ionic strength (0.7 M NaClO4) over a range of metal:ligand molar ratios, to study complexation of the siderophore desferrioxamine B (DFOB) with Mg and Ca, for which it has the highest affinity among the major seasalt cations. From similar titrations of acetohydroxamic acid in the absence and presence of methanesulfonate (mesylate), it was determined that Mg and Ca binding to this common DFOB counter-ion is not strong enough to interfere with the DFOB titrations. Stability constants were measured for all DFOB complexes with Mg and Ca including, for the first time, the bidentate complexes. No evidence was found for Mg and Ca coordination with the DFOB terminal amine. From the improved DFOB speciation, we calculated five SRCs for each of the five (de)protonated forms of DFOB in trace-metal-free seawater, yet we also present a more convenient definition of a single SRC that allows adjustment of all DFOB stability constants to seawater conditions, no matter which of these forms is selected as the component (reference species). An example of Cd speciation in seawater containing DFOB illustrates the non-trivial use of different SRCs for polyprotic, polydentate organic ligands.",2016,"desferrioxamine b; siderophore; potentiometric titration; stability constant; side-reaction coefficient; seawater; magnesium; calcium","Article","ISI"

Different motifs of di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexanucleotide SSRs were evaluated for variation in length and position in the expressed sequences, relative abundance and distribution in gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata). We found 899 ESTs that harbor 997 SSRs (4.94%). On average, one SSR was found per 2.95 kb of EST sequence and the dinucleotide SSRs are the most abundant accounting for 47.6% of the total number. EST-SSRs were used as template for primer design. 664 primer pairs could be successfully identified and a subset of 206 pairs of primers was synthesized. PCR-tested and visualized on ethidium bromide stained agarose gels. The main objective was to further assess the potential of EST-SSRs as informative markers and investigate their cross-species amplification in sixteen teleost fish species: seven sparid species and nine other species from different families. Approximately 78% of the primer pairs gave PCR products of expected size in gilthead sea bream, and as expected, the rate of successful amplification of sea bream EST-SSRs was higher in sparids, lower in other perciforms and even lower in species of the Clupeiform and Gadiform orders. We finally determined the polymorphism and the heterozygosity of 63 markers in a wild gilthead sea bream population; fifty-eight loci were found to be polymorphic with the expected heterozygosity and the number of alleles ranging from 0.089 to 0.946 and from 2 to 27, respectively. These tools and markers are expected to enhance the available genetic linkage map in gilthead sea bream, to assist comparative mapping and genome analyses for this species and further with other model fish species and finally to help advance genetic analysis for cultivated and wild populations and accelerate breeding programs.

"Regional population genetics and global phylogeography of the endangered highly migratory shark Lamna nasus: Implications for fishery management and conservation","10.1002/aqc.3455","Gonzalez, MT; Sepulveda, FA; Zarate, PM; Baeza, JA","1. The porbeagle sharkLamna nasusis a large highly migratory shark distributed in cold and temperate marine waters of the North Atlantic and Southern Hemisphere (SH). According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the porbeagle is assessed globally as Vulnerable and regionally as Critically Endangered in the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea. This study explored, for the first time, the population genetics ofL. nasusat a regional (south-east Pacific Ocean) and global scale. 2. In this study, the null hypotheses of no genetic discontinuities among populations (i) within the SH, and (ii) between the SH and Northern Hemisphere (NH) were tested. Also, the demographic history ofL. nasusin different ocean basins was assessed. Two mitochondrial markers (Control Region [CR] andcox1) well suited for population genetics inferences in sharks were used. 3. Spatial-genetic analyses suggested two genetic clusters co-occurring in the south-eastern Pacific Ocean. A two-way ANOVA using thecox1but not the CR mtDNA fragment detected an effect of genetic identity on shark body size. Phylogeographic analyses, haplotype networks, and analyses of molecular variance demonstrated genetic differences between populations from the NH and SH but not among populations in the SH. 4. Migration estimates indicated limited current maternal gene flow between the two hemispheres but high gene flow within hemispheres. Two well-defined haplotype groups with star-like shapes inhabited all ocean basins in the SH. These results could reflect a historical scenario of reproductive isolation and more recent mixture among previously isolated populations in the SH. A Bayesian skyline plot analysis indicated sudden population expansion in the SH occurring similar to 100-125 kya. 5. This study highlights the need for additional studies focusing on the population genomics (using nuclear markers, i.e. single nucleotide polymorphisms) and the general biology ofL. nasusto explore the existence of genetically dissimilar populations in the SH. Such studies will help implementing efficient genetic monitoring programmes.",2021,"conservation biology; fisheries management; population genetics","Article","ISI"
"Identification of putative olfactory G-protein coupled receptors in Crown-of-Thorns starfish, Acanthaster planci","10.1186/s12864-017-3793-4","Roberts, RE; Motti, CA; Baughman, KW; Satoh, N; Hall, MR; Cummins, SF","Background: In marine organisms, and in particular for benthic invertebrates including echinoderms, olfaction is a dominant sense with chemosensation being a critical signalling process. Until recently natural product chemistry was the primary investigative approach to elucidate the nature of chemical signals but advances in genomics and transcriptomics over the last decade have facilitated breakthroughs in understanding not only the chemistry but also the molecular mechanisms underpinning chemosensation in aquatic environments. Integration of these approaches has the potential to reveal the fundamental elements influencing community structure of benthic ecosystems as chemical signalling modulates intra-and inter-species interactions. Such knowledge also offers avenues for potential development of novel biological control methods for pest species such as the predatory Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS), Acanthaster planci which are the primary biological cause of coral cover loss in the Indo-Pacific. Results: In this study, we have analysed the COTS sensory organs through histological and electron microscopy. We then investigated key elements of the COTS molecular olfactory toolkit, the putative olfactory rhodopsin-like G protein-protein receptors (GPCRs) within its genome and olfactory organ transcriptomes. Many of the identified Acanthaster planci olfactory receptors (ApORs) genes were found to cluster within the COTS genome, indicating rapid evolution and replication from an ancestral olfactory GPCR sequence. Tube feet and terminal sensory tentacles contain the highest proportion of ApORs. In situ hybridisation confirmed the presence of four ApORs, ApOR15, 18, 25 and 43 within COTS sensory organs, however expression of these genes was not specific to the adhesive epidermis, but also within the nerve plexus of tube feet stems and within the myomesothelium. G alpha subunit proteins were also identified in the sensory organs, and we report the spatial localisation of Gai within the tube foot and sensory tentacle. Conclusions: We have identified putative COTS olfactory receptors that localise to sensory organs. These results provide a basis for future studies that may enable the development of a biological control not only for COTS, but also other native pest or invasive starfish.",2017,"olfaction; gpcr; in situ hybridisation; starfish; cots","Article","ISI"
"Phylogenetically Novel Uncultured Microbial Cells Dominate Earth Microbiomes","10.1128/mSystems.00055-18","Lloyd, KG; Steen, AD; Ladau, J; Yin, JQ; Crosby, L","To describe a microbe's physiology, including its metabolism, environmental roles, and growth characteristics, it must be grown in a laboratory culture. Unfortunately, many phylogenetically novel groups have never been cultured, so their physiologies have only been inferred from genomics and environmental characteristics. Although the diversity, or number of different taxonomic groups, of uncultured clades has been studied well, their global abundances, or numbers of cells in any given environment, have not been assessed. We quantified the degree of similarity of 16S rRNA gene sequences from diverse environments in publicly available metagenome and metatranscriptome databases, which we show have far less of the culture bias present in primer-amplified 16S rRNA gene surveys, to those of their nearest cultured relatives. Whether normalized to scaffold read depths or not, the highest abundances of metagenomic 16S rRNA gene sequences belong to phylogenetically novel uncultured groups in seawater, freshwater, terrestrial subsurface, soil, hypersaline environments, marine sediment, hot springs, hydrothermal vents, nonhuman hosts, snow, and bioreactors (22% to 87% uncultured genera to classes and 0% to 64% uncultured phyla). The exceptions were human and human-associated environments, which were dominated by cultured genera (45% to 97%). We estimate that uncultured genera and phyla could comprise 7.3 x 10(29) (81%) and 2.2 x 10(29) (25%) of microbial cells, respectively. Uncultured phyla were overrepresented in metatranscriptomes relative to metagenomes (46% to 84% of sequences in a given environment), suggesting that they are viable. Therefore, uncultured microbes, often from deeply phylogenetically divergent groups, dominate nonhuman environments on Earth, and their undiscovered physiologies may matter for Earth systems. IMPORTANCE In the past few decades, it has become apparent that most of the microbial diversity on Earth has never been characterized in laboratory cultures. We show that these unknown microbes, sometimes called microbial dark matter, are numerically dominant in all major environments on Earth, with the exception of the human body, where most of the microbes have been cultured. We also estimate that about one-quarter of the population of microbial cells on Earth belong to phyla with no cultured relatives, suggesting that these never-before-studied organisms may be important for ecosystem functions.",2018,"environmental microbiology; phylogeny; uncultured microbes","Article","ISI"
"Comparative Omics and Trait Analyses of Marine Pseudoalteromonas Phages Advance the Phage OTU Concept","10.3389/fmicb.2017.01241","Duhaime, MB; Solonenko, N; Roux, S; Verberkmoes, NC; Wichels, A; Sullivan, MB","Viruses influence the ecology and evolutionary trajectory of microbial communities. Yet our understanding of their roles in ecosystems is limited by the paucity of model systems available for hypothesis generation and testing. Further, virology is limited by the lack of a broadly accepted conceptual framework to classify viral diversity into evolutionary and ecologically cohesive units. Here, we introduce genomes, structural proteomes, and quantitative host range data for eight Pseudoalteromonas phages isolated from Helgoland (North Sea, Germany) and use these data to advance a genome-based viral operational taxonomic unit (OTU) definition. These viruses represent five new genera and inform 498 unaffiliated or unannotated protein clusters (PCs) from global virus metagenomes. In a comparison of previously sequenced Pseudoalteromonas phage isolates (n = 7) and predicted prophages (n = 31), the eight phages are unique. They share a genus with only one other isolate, Pseudoalteromonas podophage RIO-1 (East Sea, South Korea) and two Pseudoalteromonas prophages. Mass-spectrometry of purified viral particles identified 12-20 structural proteins per phage. When combined with 3-D structural predictions, these data led to the functional characterization of five previously unidentified major capsid proteins. Protein functional predictions revealed mechanisms for hijacking host metabolism and resources. Further, they uncovered a hybrid sipho-myovirus that encodes genes for Mu-like infection rarely described in ocean systems. Finally, we used these data to evaluate a recently introduced definition for virus populations that requires members of the same population to have >95% average nucleotide identity across at least 80% of their genes. Using physiological traits and genomics, we proposed a conceptual model for a viral OTU definition that captures evolutionarily cohesive and ecologically distinct units. In this trait-based framework, sensitive hosts are considered viral niches, while host ranges and infection efficiencies are tracked as viral traits. Quantitative host range assays revealed conserved traits within virus OTUs that break down between OTUs, suggesting the defined units capture niche and fitness differentiation. Together these analyses provide a foundation for model system-based hypothesis testing that will improve our understanding of marine copiotrophs, as well as phage-host interactions on the ocean particles and aggregates where Pseudoalteromonas thrive.",2017,"phage; marine microbiology; particle-associated; comparative genomics; pseudoalteromonas","Article","ISI"
"Genome- and Community-Level Interaction Insights in Carbon Utilization and Element Cycling Functions of Hydrothermarchaeota in Hydrothermal Sediment","10.1128/mSystems.00795-19","Zhou, ZC; Liu, Y; Xu, W; Pan, J; Luo, ZH; Li, M","Hydrothermal vents release reduced compounds and small organic carbon compounds into the surrounding seawater, providing essential substrates for microbial growth and bioenergy transformations. Despite the wide distribution of the marine benthic group E archaea (referred to as Hydrothermarchaeota) in the hydrothermal environment, little is known about their genomic repertoires and biogeochemical significance. Here, we studied four highly complete (>80%) metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from a black smoker chimney and the surrounding sulfur-rich sediments on the South Atlantic Mid-Ocean Ridge and publicly available data sets (the Integrated Microbial Genomes system of the U.S. Department of Energy-Joint Genome Institute and NCBI SRA data sets). Genomic analysis suggested a wide carbon metabolic diversity of Hydrothermarchaeota members, including the utilization of proteins, lactate, and acetate; the anaerobic degradation of aromatics; the oxidation of C-1, compounds (CO, formate, and formaldehyde); the utilization of methyl compounds; CO2 incorporation by the tetrahydromethanopterin-based Wood-Ljungdahl pathway; and participation in the type III ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase-based Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle. These microbes also potentially oxidize sulfur, arsenic, and hydrogen and engage in anaerobic respiration based on sulfate reduction and denitrification. Among the 140 MAGs reconstructed from the black smoker chimney microbial community (including Hydrothermarchaeota MAGs), community-level metabolic predictions suggested a redundancy of carbon utilization and element cycling functions and interactive syntrophic and sequential utilization of substrates. These processes might make various carbon and energy sources widely accessible to the microorganisms. Further, the analysis suggested that Hydrothermarchaeota members contained important functional components obtained from the community via lateral gene transfer, becoming a distinctive Glade. This might serve as a niche-adaptive strategy for metabolizing heavy metals, C, compounds, and reduced sulfur compounds. Collectively, the analysis provides comprehensive metabolic insights into the Hydrothermarchaeota. IMPORTANCE This study provides comprehensive metabolic insights into the Hydrothermarchaeota from comparative genomics, evolution, and community-level perspectives. Members of the Hydrothermarchaeota synergistically participate in a wide range of carbon-utilizing and element cycling processes with other microorganisms in the community. We expand the current understanding of community interactions within the hydrothermal sediment and chimney, suggesting that microbial interactions based on sequential substrate metabolism are essential to nutrient and element cycling.",2020,"hydrothermarchaeota; hydrothermal sediment; comparative genomics; carbon utilization; element cycling; community-level interaction; lateral gene transfer","Article","ISI"

In the present study, 35 Ca. Bathyarchaeia metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were recovered from hot spring sediments in Tibet and Yunnan, China. Phylogenetic analysis revealed all MAGs of Ca. Bathyarchaeia can be classified into 7 orders and 15 families. Among them, 4 families have been first discovered in the present study, significantly expanding the known diversity of Ca. Bathyarchaeia. Comparative genomics demonstrated Ca. Bathyarchaeia MAGs from thermal habitats to encode a large variety of genes related to carbohydrate degradation, which are likely a metabolic adaptation of these organisms to a lifestyle at high temperatures. At least two families are potential methanogens/alkanotrophs, indicating a potential for the catalysis of short-chain hydrocarbons. Three MAGs from Family-7.3 are identified as alkanotrophs due to the detection of an Mcr complex. Family-2 contains the largest number of genes relevant to alkyl-CoM transformation, indicating the potential for methylotrophic methanogenesis, although their evolutionary history suggests the ancestor of Ca. Bathyarchaeia was unable to metabolize alkanes. Subsequent lineages have acquired the ability via horizontal gene transfer. Overall, our study significantly expands our knowledge and understanding of the metabolic capabilities, habitat adaptations, and evolution of Ca. Bathyarchaeia in thermal environments. IMPORTANCE Ca. Bathyarchaeia MAGs from terrestrial hot spring habitats are poorly revealed, though they have been studied extensively in marine ecosystems. In this study, we uncovered the metabolic capabilities and ecological role of Ca. Bathyarchaeia in hot springs and give a comprehensive comparative analysis between thermal and nonthermal habitats to reveal the thermal adaptability of Ca. Bathyarchaeia. Also, we attempt to determine the evolutionary history of methane/alkane metabolism in Ca.

Much effort has been made to identify viable and ecologically relevant invertebrate test organisms to meet rigorous regulatory requirements. Copepods, which are ecologically important and widely distributed in aquatic organisms, offer a huge opportunity as test organisms for aquatic toxicity testing. They have a major role not only in the transfer of energy in aquatic food chains, but also as a medium of transfer of aquatic pollutants across the tropic levels. In this regard, a supratidal and benthic harpacticoid copepod Tigriopus japonicus Mori (order Harpacticoida) has shown promising characteristics as a test organism in the field of ecotoxicology. Because there is a need to standardize a battery of test organisms from species in different phylogenetic and critical ecosystem positions, it is important to identify another unrelated planktonic species for wider application and comparison. In this regard, the cyclopoid copepod Paracyclopina nana Smirnov (order Cyclopoida) has emerged as a potential test organism to meet such requirements. Like T. japonicus, it has a number of features that make it a candidate worth consideration in such efforts. Recently, the genomics of P. nana has been unraveled. Data on biochemical and molecular responses of P. nana against exposure to environmental chemicals and other stressors have been collected. Recently, sequences and expression profiles of a number of genes in P. nana encoding for heat shock proteins, xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes, and antioxidants have been reported. These genes serve as potential biomarkers in biomonitoring of environmental pollutants. Moreover, the application of gene expression techniques and the use of its whole transcriptome have allowed evaluation of transcriptional changes in P. nana with the ultimate aim of understanding the mechanisms of action of environmental stressors. Whole-animal bioassays and gene expression studies indicate that P. nana may serve as an excellent tool to evaluate the impact of diverse disturbances in the marine environment. With a better understanding of toxicological mechanisms, ecotoxicologists will be able to understand defense mechanisms against toxicants in copepods. In this review, we illustrate the potential of P. nana as an alternative as well as a complementary invertebrate model organism for risk assessment of aquatic pollutants. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we sequenced a stress tolerant genotype i.e. Pseudomonas sp. strain RL isolated from a hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) contaminated pond (45 mg of total HCH g(-1) sediment) and further compared its gene repertoire with 17 reference ecotypes belonging to P. stutzeri, P. mendocina, P. aeruginosa, P. psychrotolerans and P. denitrificans, representing metabolically diverse ecosystems (i.e. marine, clinical, and soil/sludge). Metagenomic data from HCH contaminated pond sediment and similar HCH contaminated sites were further used to analyze the pan-genome dynamics of Pseudomonas genotypes enriched across increasing HCH gradient. Results: Although strain RL demonstrated clear species demarcation (ANI <= 80.03%) from the rest of its phylogenetic relatives, it was found to be closest to P. stutzeri clade which was further complemented functionally. Comparative functional analysis elucidated strain specific enrichment of metabolic pathways like alpha-linoleic acid degradation and carbazole degradation in Pseudomonas sp. strain RL and P. stutzeri XLDN-R, respectively. Composition based methods (%codon bias and %G + C difference) further highlighted the significance of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in evolution of nitrogen metabolism, two-component system (TCS) and methionine metabolism across the Pseudomonas genomes used in this study. An intact mobile class-I integron (3,552 bp) with a captured gene cassette encoding for dihydrofolate reductase (dhfra1) was detected in strain RL, distinctly demarcated from other integron harboring species (i.e. P. aeruginosa, P. stutzeri, and P. putida). Mobility of this integron was confirmed by its association with Tnp21-like transposon (95% identity) suggesting stress specific mobilization across HCH contaminated sites. Metagenomics data from pond sediment and recently surveyed HCH adulterated soils revealed the in situ enrichment of integron associated transposase gene (TnpA6100) across increasing HCH contamination (0.7 to 450 mg HCH g(-1) of soil). Conclusions: Unlocking the potential of comparative genomics supplemented with metagenomics, we have attempted to resolve the environment and strain specific demarcations across 18 Pseudomonas gene complements.

Vibrio campbellii DS40M4 is a wild-type isolate that has been recently established as a highly tractable model strain for bacterial genetics studies. We sought to exploit the tractability and relevance of this strain for characterization of flagellar gene regulation in V. campbellii. Using comparative genomics, we identified homologs of V. campbellii flagellar and chemotaxis genes conserved in other members of the Vibrionaceae and determined the transcriptional profile of these loci using differential RNA-seq. We systematically deleted all 63 predicted flagellar and chemotaxis genes in V. campbellii and examined their effects on motility and flagellum production. We specifically focused on the core regulators of the flagellar hierarchy established in other vibrios: RpoN (sigma (54)), FlrA, FlrC, and FliA. Our results show that V. campbellii transcription of flagellar and chemotaxis genes is governed by a multitiered regulatory hierarchy similar to other motile Vibrio species. However, there are several critical differences in V. campbellii: (i) the sigma(54)-dependent regulator FlrA is dispensable for motility; (ii) the flgA, fliEFGHIJ, flrA, and flrBC operons do not require sigma(54) for expression; and (iii) FlrA and FlrC coregulate class II genes. Our model proposes that the V. campbellii flagellar transcriptional hierarchy has three classes of genes, in contrast to the four-class hierarchy in Vibrio cholerae. Our genetic and phenotypic dissection of the V. campbellii flagellar regulatory network highlights the differences that have evolved in flagellar regulation across the Vibrionaceae. IMPORTANCE Vibrio campbellii is a Gram-negative bacterium that is free-living and ubiquitous in marine environments and is an important global pathogen of fish and shellfish. Disruption of the flagellar motor significantly decreases host mortality of V. campbellii, suggesting that motility is a key factor in pathogenesis. Using this model organism, we identified >60 genes that encode proteins with predicted structural, mechanical, or regulatory roles in function of the single polar flagellum in V. campbellii. We systematically tested strains containing single deletions of each gene to determine the impact on motility and flagellum production. Our studies have uncovered differences in the regulatory network and function of several genes in V. campbellii compared to established systems in Vibrio cholerae and Vibrio parahaemolyticus.",2021,"motility; flagellar gene regulation; vibrio; vibrio campbellii; flagellar motility","Article","ISI"

But as uncultured organisms, their physiology, metabolism, and basis for their gigantism are not well understood. Thus, a genomics approach, applied to a single Candidatus Thiomargarita nelsonii cell was employed to explore the genetic potential of one of these enigmatic giant bacteria. The Thiomargarita cell was obtained from an assemblage of budding Ca. T. nelsonii attached to a provannid gastropod shell from Hydrate Ridge, a methane seep offshore of Oregon, USA. Here we present a manually curated genome of Bud S10 resulting from a hybrid assembly of long Pacific Biosciences and short Illumina sequencing reads. With respect to inorganic carbon fixation and sulfur oxidation pathways, the Ca. T nelsonii Hydrate Ridge Bud S10 genome was similar to marine sister taxa within the family Beggiatoaceae. However, the Bud S10 genome contains genes suggestive of the genetic potential for lithotrophic growth on arsenite and perhaps hydrogen. The genome also revealed that Bud 510 likely respires nitrate via two pathways: a complete denitrification pathway and a dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia pathway. Both pathways have been predicted, but not previously fully elucidated, in the genomes of other large, vacuolated, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. Surprisingly, the genome also had a high number of unusual features for a bacterium to include the largest number of metacaspases and introns ever reported in a bacterium. Also present, are a large number of other mobile genetic elements, such as insertion sequence (IS) transposable elements and miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs). In some cases, mobile genetic elements disrupted key genes in metabolic pathways. For example, a MITE interrupts hupL, which encodes the large subunit of the hydrogenase in hydrogen oxidation. Moreover, we detected a group I intron in one of the most critical genes in the sulfur oxidation pathway, dsrA. The dsrA group I intron also carried a MITE sequence that, like the hupL MITE family, occurs broadly across the genome. The presence of a high degree of mobile elements in genes central to Thiomargarita's core metabolism has not been previously reported in free-living bacteria and suggests a highly mutable genome.",2016,"thiomargarita; single-cell genomics; arsenite oxidation; intron; mobile genetic elements; genome instability; miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements; metacaspase","Article","ISI"

However, there have not been any systematic viromic studies in estuaries. Here, we investigated the viromes of the Delaware Bay and Chesapeake Bay, two Mid-Atlantic estuaries. Deep sequencing generated a total of 48,190 assembled viral sequences (>5 kb) and 26,487 viral populations (9,204 virus clusters and 17,845 singletons), including 319 circular viral contigs between 7.5 kb and 161.8 kb. Unknown viruses represented the vast majority of the dominant populations, while the composition of known viruses, such as pelagiphage and cyanophage, appeared to be relatively consistent across a wide range of salinity gradients and in different seasons. A difference between estuarine and ocean viromes was reflected by the proportions of Myoviridae, Podoviridae, Siphoviridae, Phycodnaviridae, and a few well-studied virus representatives. The difference in viral community between the Delaware Bay and Chesapeake Bay is significantly more pronounced than the difference caused by temperature or salinity, indicating strong local profiles caused by the unique ecology of each estuary. Interestingly, a viral contig similar to phages infecting Acinetobacter baumannii (Iraqibacter) was found to be highly abundant in the Delaware Bay but not in the Chesapeake Bay, the source of which is yet to be identified. Highly abundant viruses in both estuaries have close hits to viral sequences derived from the marine single-cell genomes or long-read single-molecule sequencing, suggesting that important viruses are still waiting to be discovered in the estuarine environment. IMPORTANCE This is the first systematic study about spatial and temporal variation of virioplankton communities in estuaries using deep metagenomics sequencing. It is among the highest-quality viromic data sets to date, showing remarkably consistent sequencing depth and quality across samples. Our results indicate that there exists a large pool of abundant and diverse viruses in estuaries that have not yet been cultivated, their genomes only available thanks to single-cell genomics or single -molecule sequencing, demonstrating the importance of these methods for viral discovery. The spatiotemporal pattern of these abundant uncultivated viruses is more variable than that of cultured viruses. Despite strong environmental gradients, season and location had surprisingly little impact on the viral community within an estuary, but we saw a significant distinction between the two estuaries and also between estuarine and open ocean viromes.",2021,"virome; virioplankton; chesapeake bay; delaware bay; estuarine ecosystem; viral community; metagenomics; microbial ecology; high-throughput sequencing; viral populations; estuarine","Article","ISI"

Despite its popularity, our knowledge about its adaptive immunity and evolution is very limited. Furthermore, nothing is known about the genomics and evolution of dolphin antigen receptor immunity. Results: Here we report a evolutionary and expression study of Tursiops truncatus T cell receptor gamma (TRG) and alpha/delta (TRA/TRD) genes. We have identified in silico the TRG and TRA/TRD genes and analyzed the relevant mature transcripts in blood and in skin from four subjects. The dolphin TRG locus is the smallest and simplest of all mammalian loci as yet studied. It shows a genomic organization comprising two variable (V1 and V2), three joining (J1, J2 and J3) and a single constant (C), genes. Despite the fragmented nature of the genome assemblies, we deduced the TRA/TRD locus organization, with the recent TRDV1 subgroup genes duplications, as it is expected in artiodactyls. Expression analysis from blood of a subject allowed us to assign unambiguously eight TRAV genes to those annotated in the genomic sequence and to twelve new genes, belonging to five different subgroups. All transcripts were productive and no relevant biases towards TRAV-J rearrangements are observed. Blood and skin from four unrelated subjects expression data provide evidence for an unusual ratio of productive/unproductive transcripts which arise from the TRG V-J gene rearrangement and for a public gamma delta TR repertoire. The productive cDNA sequences, shared both in the same and in different individuals, include biases of the TRGV1 and TRGJ2 genes. The high frequency of TRGV1-J2/TRDV1-D1-J4 productive rearrangements in dolphins may represent an interesting oligo-clonal population comparable to that found in human with the TRGV9-JP/TRDV2-D-J T cells and in primates. Conclusions: Although the features of the TRG and TRA/TRD loci organization reflect those of the so far examined artiodactyls, genomic results highlight in dolphin an unusually simple TRG locus. The cDNA analysis reveal productive TRA/TRD transcripts and unusual ratios of productive/unproductive TRG transcripts. Comparing multiple different individuals, evidence is found for a public gamma delta TCR repertoire thus suggesting that in dolphins as in human the gamma delta TCR repertoire is accompanied by selection for public gamma chain.",2016,"t cell receptor; trg locus; trgv; trgj and trgc genes; tra/trd locus; trav and trdv genes; dolphin genome; expression analysis; imgt","Article","ISI"
"Diversity in Natural Transformation Frequencies and Regulation across Vibrio Species","10.1128/mBio.02788-19","Simpson, CA; Podicheti, R; Rusch, DB; Dalia, AB; van Kessel, JC","In Vibrio species, chitin-induced natural transformation enables bacteria to take up DNA from the external environment and integrate it into their genome. Expression of the master competence regulator TfoX bypasses the need for chitin induction and drives expression of the genes required for competence in several Vibrio species. Here, we show that TfoX expression in Vibrio campbellii strains DS40M4 and NBRC 15631 enables high natural transformation frequencies. Conversely, transformation was not achieved in the model quorum-sensing strain V. campbellii BB120 (previously classified as Vibrio harveyi). Surprisingly, we find that quorum sensing is not required for transformation in V. campbellii DS40M4 or Vibrio parahaemolyticus in contrast to the established regulatory pathway in Vibrio cholerae in which quorum sensing is required to activate the competence regulator QstR. Similar to V. cholerae, expression of both QstR and TfoX is necessary for transformation in DS40M4. There is a wide disparity in transformation frequencies among even closely related Vibrio strains, with V. vulnificus having the lowest functional transformation frequency. Ectopic expression of both TfoX and QstR is sufficient to produce a significant increase in transformation frequency in Vibrio vulnificus. To explore differences in competence regulation, we used previously studied V. cholerae competence genes to inform a comparative genomics analysis coupled with transcriptomics. We find that transformation capability cannot necessarily be predicted by the level of gene conservation but rather correlates with competence gene expression following TfoX induction. Thus, we have uncovered notable species- and strain-level variations in the competence gene regulation pathway across the Vibrio genus. IMPORTANCE Naturally transformable, or competent, bacteria are able to take up DNA from their environment, a key method of horizontal gene transfer for acquisition of new DNA sequences. Our research shows that Vibrio species that inhabit marine environments exhibit a wide diversity in natural transformation capability ranging from nontransformability to high transformation rates in which 10% of cells measurably incorporate new DNA. We show that the role of regulatory systems controlling the expression of competence genes (e.g., quorum sensing) differs throughout both the species and strain levels. We explore natural transformation capabilities of Vibrio campbellii species which have been thus far uncharacterized and find novel regulation of competence. Expression of two key transcription factors, TfoX and QstR, is necessary to stimulate high levels of transformation in Vibrio campbellii and recover low rates of transformation in Vibrio vulnificus.",2019,"competence; natural transformation; vibrio; quorum sensing","Article","ISI"

"Will life find a way? Evolution of marine species under global change","10.1111/eva.12418","Calosi, P; De Wit, P; Thor, P; Dupont, S","Projections of marine biodiversity and implementation of effective actions for its maintenance in the face of current rapid global environmental change are constrained by our limited understanding of species' adaptive responses, including transgenerational plasticity, epigenetics and natural selection. This special issue presents 13 novel studies, which employ experimental and modelling approaches to (i) investigate plastic and evolutionary responses of marine species to major global change drivers; (ii) ask relevant broad eco-evolutionary questions, implementing multiple species and populations studies; (iii) show the advantages of using advanced experimental designs and tools; (iv) construct novel model organisms for marine evolution; (v) help identifying future challenges for the field; and (vi) highlight the importance of incorporating existing evolutionary theory into management solutions for the marine realm. What emerges is that at least some populations of marine species have the ability to adapt to future global change conditions. However, marine organisms' capacity for adaptation appears finite, due to evolutionary trade-offs and possible rapid losses in genetic diversity. This further corroborates the idea that acquiring an evolutionary perspective on how marine life will respond to the selective pressure of future global changes will guide us in better identifying which conservation efforts will be most needed and most effective.",2016,"marine evolution; ocean warming; ocean acidification; salinity; phenotypic plasticity; local adaptation; rapid adaptation; epigenetics; evolutionary modeling; transgenerational responses; dna methylation; common garden experiment","Article","ISI"
"Complex signatures of genomic variation of two non-model marine species in a homogeneous environment","10.1186/s12864-018-4721-y","Nielsen, ES; Henriques, R; Toonen, RJ; Knapp, ISS; Guo, BC; von der Heyden, S","Background: Genomic tools are increasingly being used on non-model organisms to provide insights into population structure and variability, including signals of selection. However, most studies are carried out in regions with distinct environmental gradients or across large geographical areas, in which local adaptation is expected to occur. Therefore, the focus of this study is to characterize genomic variation and selective signals over short geographic areas within a largely homogeneous region. To assess adaptive signals between microhabitats within the rocky shore, we compared genomic variation between the Cape urchin (Parechinus angulosus), which is a low to mid-shore species, and the Granular limpet (Scutellastra granularis), a high shore specialist. Results: Using pooled restriction site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing, we described patterns of genomic variation and identified outlier loci in both species. We found relatively low numbers of outlier SNPs within each species, and identified outlier genes associated with different selective pressures than those previously identified in studies conducted over larger environmental gradients. The number of population-specific outlier loci differed between species, likely owing to differential selective pressures within the intertidal environment. Interestingly, the outlier loci were highly differentiated within the two northernmost populations for both species, suggesting that unique evolutionary forces are acting on marine invertebrates within this region. Conclusions: Our study provides a background for comparative genomic studies focused on non-model species, as well as a baseline for the adaptive potential of marine invertebrates along the South African west coast. We also discuss the caveats associated with Pool-seq and potential biases of sequencing coverage on downstream genomic metrics. The findings provide evidence of species-specific selective pressures within a homogeneous environment, and suggest that selective forces acting on small scales are just as crucial to acknowledge as those acting on larger scales. As a whole, our findings imply that future population genomic studies should expand from focusing on model organisms and/or studying heterogeneous regions to better understand the evolutionary processes shaping current and future biodiversity patterns, particularly when used in a comparative phylogeographic context.",2018,"genomics; rad-seq; comparative phylogeography; snp; local adaptation; population differentiation","Article","ISI"

We exploited the North Sea-Baltic Sea transition for investigating the seascape genetics of a marine diatom, Skeletonema marinoi. Eight polymorphic microsatellite loci were analysed in 354 individuals from ten locations to analyse population structure of the species along a 1500-km-long salinity gradient ranging from 3 to 30psu. To test for salinity adaptation, salinity reaction norms were determined for sets of strains originating from three different salinity regimes of the gradient. Modelled oceanographic connectivity was compared to directional relative migration by correlation analyses to examine oceanographic drivers. Population genetic analyses showed distinct genetic divergence of a low-salinity Baltic Sea population and a high-salinity North Sea population, coinciding with the most evident physical dispersal barrier in the area, the Danish Straits. Baltic Sea populations displayed reduced genetic diversity compared to North Sea populations. Growth optima of low salinity isolates were significantly lower than those of strains from higher native salinities, indicating local salinity adaptation. Although the North Sea-Baltic Sea transition was identified as a barrier to gene flow, migration between Baltic Sea and North Sea populations occurred. However, the presence of differentiated neutral markers on each side of the transition zone suggests that migrants are maladapted. It is concluded that local salinity adaptation, supported by oceanographic connectivity patterns creating an asymmetric migration pattern between the Baltic Sea and the North Sea, determines genetic differentiation patterns in the transition zone.",2015,"local adaptation; marine phytoplankton; oceanographic connectivity; population genetics","Article","ISI"

Knowledge of the extent of local adaptation and gene flow may explain such patterns and help predict future trajectories under scenarios of climate change. We test the extent to which local differentiation in thermal tolerance is influenced by gene flow and local adaptation using a widely distributed intertidal seaweed (Hormosira banksii) from temperate Australia. Population surveys across 2,000 km of the species range revealed strong genetic structuring at regional and local scales (global F-ST = 0.243) reflecting extremely limited gene flow, while common garden experiments (14-day exposures to 15, 18, 21 degrees C) revealed strong site differences in early development and mortality in response to elevated temperature. Embryos from many sites spanning a longitudinal thermal gradient showed suppressed development and increased mortality to elevated water temperatures, but populations originating from warmer and more variable thermal environments tended to be less susceptible to warming. Notably, there was significant local-scale variation in the thermal responses of embryos within regions which was corroborated by the finding of small-scale genetic differences. We expect the observed genetic and phenotypic differentiation to lead to uneven responses to warming sea surface temperatures in this important marine foundation species.

Low genetic structure was observed, as well as high gene flow over long distances. The demographic analyses suggest that L. flava has had periods of population bottlenecks followed by expansion. According to both palaeodistribution and coalescent simulations, these expansion events occurred during the Pleistocene interglacial cycles (21 kya) and the associated climatic changes were the probable drivers of the distribution of the species.

However, strong directional advection of water masses or retentive hydrodynamic forces can influence the degree of genetic exchange among marine populations. To determine the oceanographic drivers of genetic structure in a highly dispersive marine invertebrate, the giant California sea cucumber (Parastichopus californicus), we first tested for the presence of genetic discontinuities along the coast of North America in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. Then, we tested two hypotheses regarding spatial processes influencing population structure: (i) isolation by distance (IBD: genetic structure is explained by geographic distance) and (ii) isolation by resistance (IBR: genetic structure is driven by ocean circulation). Using RADseq, we genotyped 717 individuals from 24 sampling locations across 2,719 neutral SNPs to assess the degree of population differentiation and integrated estimates of genetic variation with inferred connectivity probabilities from a biophysical model of larval dispersal mediated by ocean currents. We identified two clusters separating north and south regions, as well as significant, albeit weak, substructure within regions (F-ST = 0.002, p = .001). After modelling the asymmetric nature of ocean currents, we demonstrated that local oceanography (IBR) was a better predictor of genetic variation (R-2 = .49) than geographic distance (IBD) (R-2 = .18), and directional processes played an important role in shaping fine-scale structure.

In marine systems this is challenging due to a paucity of information on habitat heterogeneity at local and regional scales and a dependency on sampling regimes that are typically limited to broad longitudinal and latitudinal environmental gradients. As a result, the spatial scales at which selection processes operate and the environmental factors that contribute to genetic adaptation in marine systems are likely to be unclear. In this study we explore patterns of adaptive genetic structuring in a commercially- harvested abalone species (Haliotis rubra) from southeastern Australia, using a panel of genome-wide SNP markers (5,239 SNPs), and a sampling regime informed by marine LiDAR bathymetric imagery and 20-year hindcasted oceanographic models. Despite a lack of overall genetic structure across the sampling distribution, significant genotype associations with heterogeneous habitat features were observed at local and regional spatial scales, including associations with wave energy, ocean current, sea surface temperature, and geology. These findings provide insights into the potential resilience of the species to changing marine climates and the role of migration and selection on recruitment processes, with implications for conservation and fisheries management.

Research on colour polymorphism (CP), which typically has a genetic basis, can shed light on this issue. However, because gene flow can homogenise genetic variation, understanding population connectivity is critical in examining the maintenance of polymorphisms. In this study we assess the utility of genotyping-by-sequencing to resolve gene flow, and provide a preliminary investigation into the genetic basis of CP in Isocladus armatus, an endemic New Zealand marine isopod. Analysis of the genetic variation in 4,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within and among populations and colour morphs revealed large differences in gene flow across two spatial scales. Marine isopods, which lack a pelagic larval phase, are typically assumed to exhibit greater population structuring than marine invertebrates possessing a biphasic life cycle. However, we found high gene flow rates and no genetic subdivision between two North Island populations situated 8 km apart. This suggests that I. armatus is capable of substantial dispersal along coastlines. In contrast, we identified a strong genetic disjunction between North and South Island populations. This result is similar to those reported in other New Zealand marine species, and is congruent with the presence of a geophysical barrier to dispersal down the east coast of New Zealand. We also found some support for a genetic basis to colouration evidenced by positive FST outlier tests, with two SNPs in particular showing strong association to the expression of a striped morph. Our study provides one of the first population genomic studies of a marine organism in New Zealand, and suggests that genotyping-by-sequencing can be a good alternative to more traditional investigations based on traditional markers such as microsatellites.

To delineate patterns of population structure as well as test for signatures of local adaptation, a total of 68,666 quality filtered SNP markers were identified for 80 individuals from four overwintering populations by using restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq). Significant genetic differentiation among overwintering populations from the Central Yellow Sea, the South Yellow Sea and the North East China Sea were detected (Pair-wise F-ST: 0.00036-0.00390), which were consistent with population division of overwintering groups inferred from traditional ecological approaches. In addition, a total of 126 unique SNPs were detected to be significantly associated with environmental parameters (temperature, salinity and turbidity). These candidate SNPs were involved in multiple pathways such as energy metabolism and phagocytosis, suggesting they may play key roles in growth and innate immunity.

"Evidence for metaviromic islands in marine phages","10.3389/fmicb.2014.00027","Mizuno, CM; Ghai, R; Rodriguez-Valera, F","Metagenomic islands (MGIs) have been defined as genomic regions in prokaryotic genomes that under-recruit from metagenomes where most of the same genome recruits at close to 100% identity over most of its length. The presence of MGIs in prokaryotes has been associated to the diversity of concurrent lineages that vary at this level to disperse the predatory pressure of phages that, reciprocally, maintain high clonal diversity in the population and improve ecosystem performance. This was proposed as a Constant-Diversity (C-D) model. Here we have investigated the regions of phage genomes under-recruiting in a metavirome constructed with a sample from the same habitat where they were retrieved. Some of the genes found to under-recruit are involved in host recognition as would be expected from the C-D model. Furthermore, the recruitment of intragenic regions known to be involved in molecular recognition also had a significant under-recruitment compared to the rest of the gene. However, other genes apparently disconnected from the recognition process under-recruited often, specifically the terminases involved in packaging of the phage genome in the capsid and a few others. In addition, some highly related phage genomes (at nucleotide sequence level) had no metaviromic islands (MVIs).

The potential role marine reserves may play in mitigating the effects of reduced water quality has received little attention. We investigated the spatial and temporal variability in live coral and macro-algal cover and water quality during moderate and major flooding events of the Fitzroy River within the Keppel Bay region of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park from 2007 to 2013. We used 7 years of remote sensing data on water quality and data from long-term monitoring of coral reefs to quantify exposure of coral reefs to flood plumes. We used a distance linear model to partition the contribution of abiotic and biotic factors, including zoning, as drivers of the observed changes in coral and macro-algae cover. Moderate flood plumes from 2007 to 2009 did not affect coral cover on reefs in the Keppel Islands, suggesting the reef has intrinsic resistance against short-term exposure to reduced water quality. However, from 2009 to 2013, live coral cover declined by approximate to 50% following several weeks of exposure to turbid, low salinity water from major flood plume events in 2011 and subsequent moderate events in 2012 and 2013. Although the flooding events in 2012 and 2013 were smaller than the flooding events between 2007 to 2009, the ability of the reefs to withstand these moderate floods was lost, as evidenced by a approximate to 20% decline in coral cover between 2011 to 2013. Although zoning (no-take reserve or fished) was identified a significant driver of coral cover, we recorded consistently lower coral cover on reserve reefs than on fished reefs throughout the study period and significantly lower cover in 2011. Our findings suggest that even reefs with an inherent resistance to reduced water quality are not able to withstand repeated disturbance events. The limitations of reserves in mitigating the effects of reduced water quality on near-shore coral reefs underscores the importance of integrated management approaches that combine effective land-based management with networks of no-take reserves.",2016,"coastal development; disturbance; great barrier reef; local adaptation; mpa; resilience","Article","ISI"

Here, we performed restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) to assess population genetic diversity and further investigate genomic signatures of local adaptation in the marine invasive ascidian, Molgula manhattensis. We revealed that most invasive populations exhibited significant genetic differentiation, low recent gene flow, and no signal of significant population bottleneck. Based on three genome scan approaches, we identified 109 candidate loci potentially under environmental selection. Redundancy analysis and variance partitioning analysis suggest that local environmental factors, particularly the salinity-related variables, represent crucial evolutionary forces in driving adaptive divergence. Using the newly developed transcriptome as a reference, 14 functional genes were finally obtained with potential roles in salinity adaptation, including SLC5A1 and SLC9C1 genes from the solute carrier gene (SLC) superfamily.

While natural selection can lead to local adaptation, high connectivity can diminish the potential for such adaptation to occur. Connectivity, defined as the exchange of individuals among subpopulations, is presumed to be significant in most marine species due to life histories that include widely dispersive stages. However, evidence of local adaptation in marine species, such the Atlantic silverside, Menidia menidia, raises questions concerning the degree of connectivity. We examined geochemical signatures in the otoliths, or ear bones, of adult Atlantic silversides collected in 11 locations along the northeastern coast of the United States from New Jersey to Maine in 2004 and eight locations in 2005 using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and isotope ratio monitoring mass spectrometry (irm-MS). These signatures were then compared to baseline signatures of juvenile fish of known origin to determine natal origin of these adult fish. We then estimated migration distances and the degree of mixing from these data. In both years, fish generally had the highest probability of originating from the same location in which they were captured (0.01-0.80), but evidence of mixing throughout the sample area was present. Furthermore, adult M. menidia exhibit highly dispersive behavior with some fish migrating over 700 km. The probability of adult fish returning to natal areas differed between years, with the probability being, on average, 0.2 higher in the second year. These findings demonstrate that marine species with largely open populations are capable of local adaptation despite apparently high gene flow.",2010,"atlantic silverside; connectivity; gene flow; local adaptation; menidia menidia; northeastern us coast; otolith chemistry; population structure","Article","ISI"

Such contemporary ancestors can be used to demonstrate the effects of selection by comparing phenotypic and genetic divergence between the derived population and their extant ancestors. However, evolution and demography in these contemporary ancestors can complicate inferences about the source (standing genetic variation, de novo mutation) and pace of adaptive divergence. Marine threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) have colonized freshwater environments along the Pacific coast of North America, but have also persisted in the marine environment. To what extent are marine stickleback good proxies of the ancestral condition? Results: We sequenced > 5800 variant loci in over 250 marine stickleback from eight locations extending from Alaska to California, and phenotyped them for platedness and body shape. Pairwise FST varied from 0.02 to 0.18. Stickleback were divided into five genetic clusters, with a single cluster comprising stickleback from Washington to Alaska. Plate number, Eda, body shape, and candidate loci showed evidence of being under selection in the marine environment. Comparisons to a freshwater population demonstrated that candidate loci for freshwater adaptation varied depending on the choice of marine populations. Conclusions: Marine stickleback are structured into phenotypically and genetically distinct populations that have been evolving as freshwater stickleback evolved. This variation complicates their usefulness as proxies of the ancestors of freshwater populations.

"Population Genomics Reveals Shallow Genetic Structure in a Connected and Ecologically Important Fish From the Northwestern Pacific Ocean","10.3389/fmars.2020.00374","Zhang, BD; Li, YL; Xue, DX; Liu, JX","Genetic variation at the genomic level is invaluable to identify fish stock structure in fisheries management. It has been widely accepted that populations of marine fishes are highly connected owing to fewer barriers to gene flow and increased connectivity resulting from greater dispersal abilities. Since population genomic approaches have increased the accessibility and resolution of population genetic data, it further facilitates to study and detect previously unidentified structures as well as signatures for natural selection in wild populations. In the present study, restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing was applied to the samples of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of Engraulis japonicus, a small pelagic fish of ecological and economic importance in the northwestern Pacific. To assess population genetic structure as well as detection for local adaptation of E. japonicus, a total of 389 individuals from six regional populations of the northwestern Pacific were collected and a set of 12,627 SNPs was developed.

Moreover, no sign of local adaptation was detected, which might be the product of high gene flow among regional populations.

"Genotype by sequencing identifies natural selection as a driver of intraspecific divergence in Atlantic populations of the high dispersal marine invertebrate, Macoma petalum","10.1002/ece3.3332","Metivier, SL; Kim, JH; Addison, JA","Mitochondrial DNA analyses indicate that the Bay of Fundy population of the intertidal tellinid bivalve Macoma petalum is genetically divergent from coastal populations in the Gulf of Maine and Nova Scotia. To further examine the evolutionary forces driving this genetic break, we performed double digest genotype by sequencing (GBS) to survey the nuclear genome for evidence of both neutral and selective processes shaping this pattern. The resulting reads were mapped to a partial transcriptome of its sister species, M.balthica, to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in protein-coding genes. Population assignment tests, principle components analyses, analysis of molecular variance, and outlier tests all support differentiation between the Bay of Fundy genotype and the genotypes of the Gulf of Maine, Gulf of St. Lawrence, and Nova Scotia. Although both neutral and non-neutral patterns of genetic subdivision were significant, genetic structure among the regions was nearly 20 times higher for loci putatively under selection, suggesting a strong role for natural selection as a driver of genetic diversity in this species. Genetic differences were the greatest between the Bay of Fundy and all other population samples, and some outlier proteins were involved in immunity-related processes. Our results suggest that in combination with limited gene flow across the mouth of the Bay of Fundy, local adaptation is an important driver of intraspecific genetic variation in this marine species with high dispersal potential.",2017,"high dispersal; marine invertebrate; natural selection; outlier; population genomics; single nucleotide polymorphism","Article","ISI"
"Detecting polygenic selection in marine populations by combining population genomics and quantitative genetics approaches","10.1093/cz/zow088","Gagnaire, PA; Gaggiotti, OE","Highly fecund marine species with dispersive life-history stages often display large population sizes and wide geographic distribution ranges. Consequently, they are expected to experience reduced genetic drift, efficient selection fueled by frequent adaptive mutations, and high migration loads. This has important consequences for understanding how local adaptation proceeds in the sea. A key issue in this regard, relates to the genetic architecture underlying fitness traits. Theory predicts that adaptation may involve many genes but with a high variance in effect size. Therefore, the effect of selection on allele frequencies may be substantial for the largest effect size loci, but insignificant for small effect genes. In such a context, the performance of population genomic methods to unravel the genetic basis of adaptation depends on the fraction of adaptive genetic variance explained by the cumulative effect of outlier loci. Here, we address some methodological challenges associated with the detection of local adaptation using molecular approaches. We provide an overview of genome scan methods to detect selection, including those assuming complex demographic models that better describe spatial population structure. We then focus on quantitative genetics approaches that search for genotype-phenotype associations at different genomic scales, including genome-wide methods evaluating the cumulative effect of variants. We argue that the limited power of single locus tests can be alleviated by the use of polygenic scores to estimate the joint contribution of candidate variants to phenotypic variation.",2016,"local adaptation; genome scans; quantitative genetics; genotype-phenotype association; polygenic scores","Article","ISI"

However, population genetic structure in marine fishes has been proposed to be highly limited, which might be attributed to fewer barriers to gene flow as well as large population sizes, resulting in relatively high levels of connectivity among populations. Population genomic approaches have increased the accessibility and resolution of population genetic data to make ecological inferences, which made it possible to detect previously unidentified structure and obtain more accurate estimates of demographic parameters in wild populations. Here, we used restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing to sample genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of Larimichthys polyactis, a marine fish species of high ecological and commercial importance distributed in coast of East Asia. To assess range-wide patterns of population structure of L. polyactis, a total of 93 individuals were sampled from six geographic localities along the coast of China. Two final datasets were developed from the nuclear and the mitochondrial genomes, which consisted of 14, 194 SNPs and 15 SNPs respectively. Pairwise F-ST across sampling localities were not significant and most genetic variation was found within individuals rather than among populations within groups or among groups. Both clustering analyses and discriminant analysis failed to detect any population structure. Our findings demonstrated the persistence of high levels of genetic connectivity and a lack of population structure across sampling locations of L. polyactis in inshore waters of China.",2020,"population genomics; larimichthys polyactis; single-nucleotide polymorphisms; rad-seq","Article","ISI"

Adams, 1853) and C. violacea (Kiener, 1836). These obligate ectoparasites prey upon corals and are sympatric throughout much of their ranges in coral reefs of the tropical and subtropical Indo-Pacific. We tested for population genetic structure of snails in relation to geography and their host corals using mtDNA (COI) sequences in minimum spanning trees and AMOVAs. We also examined the evolutionary relationships of their Porites host coral species using maximum likelihood trees of RAD-seq (restriction site-associated DNA sequencing) loci mapped to a reference transcriptome. A maximum likelihood tree of host corals revealed three distinct clades. Coralliophila radula showed a pronounced genetic break across the Sunda Shelf (Phi (CT) = 0.735) but exhibited no genetic structure with respect to host. C. violacea exhibited significant geographic structure (Phi(CT) = 0.427), with divergence among Hawaiian populations, the Coral Triangle and the Indian Ocean. Notably, C. violacea showed evidence of ecological divergence; two lineages were associated with different groups of host coral species, one widespread found at all sites, and the other restricted to the Coral Triangle. Sympatric populations of C. violacea found on different suites of coral species were highly divergent (Phi(CT) = 0.561, d = 5.13%), suggesting that symbiotic relationships may contribute to lineage diversification in the Coral Triangle.",2018,"marine gastropod; parasite; sister species; porites; rad-seq","Article","ISI"
"Phenotypic evidence for local adaptation to heat stress in the marine snail Chlorostoma (formerly Tegula) funebralis","10.1016/j.jembe.2013.08.008","Gleason, LU; Burton, RS","Southern California (USA) populations of the intertidal marine snail Chlorostoma (formerly Tegula) funebralis generally occupy warmer climates and are exposed to high air temperatures during low tides more often than northern California populations. Available genetic data suggest there is extensive gene flow across a broad range of C funebralis populations, so it is unclear if populations can adapt to differences in local environments. To test for population-specific responses to heat stress, three phenotypic assays were performed on three northern and on three southern populations of C. funebralis, after acclimation to common-garden conditions in the laboratory. Thermal drop-down, heat stress mortality, and heat stress reattachment assays were designed to evaluate ecologically relevant phenotypic responses to heat stress; these assays assessed tolerance during, mortality following, and speed of recovery following heat stress. The latter two tests indicate that southern populations consistently suffer significantly lower mortality and recover significantly more quickly following heat stress compared to northern populations. Hierarchical cluster analysis of stress response data clearly identified northern California and southern California regional groupings of populations. Thus, these results indicate that southern populations have higher tolerance to heat stress than northern populations and suggest that adaptation to local environmental differences can evolve despite moderate potential for larval dispersal in this species. Accounting for intraspecific population variation in thermal tolerance may provide important insights for predicting how species distributions will respond to global warming. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Here, the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus was used as a model system to study how local adaptation influences the cold tolerance of a broadly distributed marine crustacean. Among five populations spanning 18 degrees in latitude, the following three metrics were used to compare cold tolerance: the temperature of chill-coma onset, the chill-coma recovery time and post-freezing recovery. In comparison to copepods from warmer southern latitudes, animals from northern populations exhibited lower chill-coma onset temperatures, shorter chill-coma recovery times and faster post-freezing recovery rates. Importantly, all three metrics showed a consistent latitudinal trend, suggesting that any single metric could be used equivalently in future studies investigating latitudinal variation in cold tolerance. Our results agree with previous studies showing that populations within a single species can display strong local adaptation to spatially varying climatic conditions. Thus, accounting for local adaptation in bioclimate models will be useful for understanding how broadly distributed species like T. californicus will respond to anthropogenic climate change.",2014,"chill-coma; cold tolerance; local adaptation; macrophysiology trend; tigriopus californicus","Article","ISI"

There is an urgent need to understand the underlying mechanisms that influence the persistence of populations across a species' distribution range in the face of global warming. Ocenebra erinaceus is a marine gastropod that exhibits high intraspecific variability in maternal investment and physiological capacity during early stages, which suggests local adaptation to natal environmental conditions. In this study, reproductive traits and trans-generational adaptation were measured in two subtidal populations: one from the middle (the Solent, UK) and another towards the southern end of their geographic distribution (Arcachon, France). Local adaptation was evaluated with a transfer experiment (i.e. Arcachon females transferred to Solent thermal conditions) and trans-generational adaptation was evaluated in the thermal tolerance response of embryos exposed to temperatures between 10 and 20 degrees C. This study shows that both populations have similar fitness; however, there are adaptive costs to live under their natal location, resulting in trade-offs between reproductive traits. Transferred females show lower reproductive output, which suggests that females are maladapted to live under a new environment. The trans-generational experiment demonstrates contrasting thermal tolerance ranges between populations. Adaptation to local thermal conditions was observed in transferred embryos, showing poor performance and high mortalities under the new environment. Our results provide a better understanding of intraspecific differences and adaptations across a species' distribution range and provide insights into how climate warming will impact encapsulated species exhibiting location-specific adaptation.",2020,"gastropoda; intraspecific differences; plasticity; fecundity; local adaptation","Article","ISI"

This information is important for species conservation efforts and stock management in both wild and captive populations, as well as genome mapping and genome wide association studies. Double digest Restriction site-Associated DNA Sequencing (ddRADseq) is a recent tool for delivering genome wide SNPs for non-model organisms. However, its application to marine invertebrate taxa has been limited, particularly given the complex and highly repetitive nature of many of these organisms' genomes. This study develops and evaluates an optimised ddRADseq technique together with associated analyses for generating genome-wide SNP data, and performs population genomic analyses to inform aquaculture and fishery management of a marine bivalve, the black-lip pearl oyster Pinctada margaritifera. A total of 5243 high-quality genome-wide SNP markers were detected, and used to assess population structure, genome diversity, detect Fst outliers and perform association testing in 156 individuals belonging to three wild and one hatchery produced populations from the Fiji Islands. Shallow but significant population structure was revealed among all wild populations (average pairwise Fst = 0.046) when visualised with DAPC and an individual network analysis (NetView P), with clear evidence of a genetic bottleneck in the hatchery population (N-eLD = 6.1), compared to wild populations (N-eLD > 192.5). Fst outlier detection revealed 42-62 highly differentiated SNPs (p < 0.02), while case-control association discovered up to 152 SNPs (p < 0.001). Both analyses were able to successfully differentiate individuals between the orange and black tissue colour morphotypes characteristic of this species. BLAST searches revealed that five of these SNPs were associated with a melanin biosynthesis pathway, demonstrating their biological relevance.

Given recent advances in high-throughput sequencing, an emerging question is whether various genotyping approaches, in concert with improved sampling designs, will substantially improve our understanding of genetic structure in the sea. To address this question, we explored hierarchical patterns of structure in the coral reef fish Elacatinus lori using a high-resolution approach with respect to both genetic and geographic sampling. Previously, we identified three putative E. lori populations within Belize using traditional genetic markers and sparse geographic sampling: barrier reef and Turneffe Atoll; Glover's Atoll; and Lighthouse Atoll. Here, we systematically sampled individuals at similar to 10 km intervals throughout these reefs (1,129 individuals from 35 sites) and sequenced all individuals at three sets of markers: 2,418 SNPs; 89 microsatellites; and 57 nonrepetitive nuclear loci. At broad spatial scales, the markers were consistent with each other and with previous findings. At finer spatial scales, there was new evidence of genetic substructure, but our three marker sets differed slightly in their ability to detect these patterns. Specifically, we found subtle structure between the barrier reef and Turneffe Atoll, with SNPs resolving this pattern most effectively. We also documented isolation by distance within the barrier reef. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the number of loci (and alleles) had a strong effect on the detection of structure for all three marker sets, particularly at small spatial scales. Taken together, these results illustrate empirically that high-throughput genotyping data can elucidate subtle genetic structure at previously-undetected scales in a dispersive marine fish.",2020,"amplicon sequencing; coral reef; elacatinus lori; population genomics; seascape genetics; snp","Article","ISI"

First, COI sequences were analysed using three methods of species delimitation to propose primary species hypotheses. Second, RAD sequencing data were also obtained and a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree produced. We tested the impact of the level of missing data on the robustness of the phylogenetic tree obtained with the RAD-seq data. Alternative species partitions revealed with the COI data set were also tested using the RAD-seq data and the Bayes factor species delimitation method. The congruence between the species hypotheses proposed with the mitochondrial nuclear data sets, together with the morphological variability of the shell and the radula and the distribution pattern, was used to turn the primary species hypotheses into secondary species hypotheses. Allopatric primary species hypotheses defined with the COI gene were interpreted to correspond to intraspecific structure.

"Unravelling the effects of gene flow and selection in highly connected populations of the silver-lip pearl oyster (Pinctada maxima)","10.1016/j.margen.2016.02.005","Nayfa, MG; Zenger, KR","Many marine organisms often display weak levels of population genetic structuring as a result of both environmental characteristics (e.g., ocean currents) and life history traits (e.g., widely dispersed planktonic larval stages) maintaining high levels of gene flow. This can lead to the assumption that these organisms can be managed as a single stock based on high levels of population connectivity. However, this neglects to account for other micro evolutionary forces such as selection, which also shape these populations. This study utilizes 1130 genome-wide SNP loci to unravel the effects of gene flow and selection shaping three highly connected populations of the silver-lip pearl oyster (Pinctada maxima) in the ecologically and economically important Indo-Pacific region (Aru, Bali, and West Papua). Twenty-two loci under directional selection were identified amongst the populations, providing further supporting evidence of strong local adaptation (i.e., G x E effects) among populations in this region. Global F-st values for directional outliers (0.348) were up to eight times greater than for neutral markers (0.043). Pairwise E-st comparisons between Aru and Bali revealed the largest directional differences (0.488), while Bali and West Papua had the least (0.062). Unrooted neighbour-joining (NJ) distance trees and genetic diversity indices of directional outliers revealed that individuals from Bali and West Papua had reduced allelic variation (MAF(avg) = 0.144, H-o = 0.238 and MAF(avg) = 0.232, H-o = 0369, respectively) compared to Aru (MAF(avg) = 0.292, H-o = 0.412). This indicates that directional selection is most likely acting upon genetic variation within the Bali and West Papua populations. NJ distance trees, discriminant analysis of principal components, and Est analyses of directional outliers revealed two divergent groups (Bali/West Papua; Aru) that had previously gone unrecognized. This study not only illustrates that relatively strong local adaptive forces are occurring despite high gene flow, but identifies the populations that are most likely experiencing selection.

To date, our knowledge of genotypic variation and evolution has largely been acquired by means of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) analyses. Until recently, the adaptive role of structural variants (SVs) and particularly that of CNVs has been overlooked in wild populations, partly due to their challenging identification. Here, we document the usefulness of Rapture, a derived reduced-representation shotgun sequencing approach, to detect and investigate copy number variants (CNVs) alongside SNPs in American lobster (Homarus americanus) populations. We conducted a comparative study to examine the potential role of SNPs and CNVs in local adaptation by sequencing 1,141 lobsters from 21 sampling sites within the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, which experiences the highest yearly thermal variance of the Canadian marine coastal waters. Our results demonstrated that CNVs account for higher genetic differentiation than SNP markers. Contrary to SNPs, for which no significant genetic-environment association was found, 48 CNV candidates were significantly associated with the annual variance of sea surface temperature, leading to the genetic clustering of sampling locations despite their geographic separation. Altogether, we provide a strong empirical case that CNVs putatively contribute to local adaptation in marine species and unveil stronger spatial signal of population structure than SNPs. Our study provides the means to study CNVs in nonmodel species and highlights the importance of considering structural variants alongside SNPs to enhance our understanding of ecological and evolutionary processes shaping adaptive population structure.",2020,"american lobster; copy number variants; fishery management; local adaptation; structural variants","Article","ISI"

Here, a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) approach was used to examine genomic variation in an early life stage (megalopae) of the Dungeness crab (Cancer magister), which constitutes the most valuable single-species commercial fishery in the CCE. Variation in abundance and timing of megalopae recruitment has been extensively studied for over two decades in Coos Bay, Oregon, United States. Within the CCE, documented timing of Dungeness crab life history events indicates that coastal megalopae recruitment is expected to occur April through July; however, long-term studies in Coos Bay have observed late-season recruitment from August to October. Based on variation at 1,913 presumably neutral loci, evidence was found for weak, yet significant differentiation (F-ST estimate = 0.0011) between the 2014 expected-season recruits (n = 47) and late-season recruits (n = 47) collected in Coos Bay. However, two putatively adaptive loci with a high F-ST estimate (0.2036) between expected-season and late-season recruits were identified. These findings support the hypothesis that expected-season and lateseason megalopae recruiting to Coos Bay within the same year may have originated from different locations or from different breeding groups.

However, anthropogenic activities also have the capacity to create novel niche spaces to which species respond differently. In 1880, one such habitat alterations occurred in Landvikvannet, a freshwater lake on the Norwegian coast of Skagerrak, which became brackish after being artificially connected to the sea. This lake is now home to the European sprat, a pelagic marine fish that managed to develop a self-recruiting population in barely few decades. Landvikvannet sprat proved to be genetically isolated from the three main populations described for this species; that is, Norwegian fjords, Baltic Sea, and the combination of North Sea, Kattegat, and Skagerrak. This distinctness was depicted by an accuracy self-assignment of 89% and a highly significant F-ST between the lake sprat and each of the remaining samples (average of approximate to 0.105). The correlation between genetic and environmental variation indicated that salinity could be an important environmental driver of selection (3.3% of the 91 SNPs showed strong associations). Likewise, Isolation by Environment was detected for salinity, although not for temperature, in samples not adhering to an Isolation by Distance pattern. Neighbor-joining tree analysis suggested that the source of the lake sprat is in the Norwegian fjords, rather than in the Baltic Sea despite a similar salinity profile. Strongly drifted allele frequencies and lower genetic diversity in Landvikvannet compared with the Norwegian fjords concur with a founder effect potentially associated with local adaptation to low salinity. Genetic differentiation (F-ST) between marine and brackish sprat is larger in the comparison Norway-Landvikvannet than in Norway-Baltic, which suggests that the observed divergence was achieved in Landvikvannet in some 65 generations, that is, 132 years, rather than gradually over thousands of years (the age of the Baltic Sea), thus highlighting the pace at which human-driven evolution can happen.",2021,"evolutionary response; habitat alteration; local adaptation; snp; sprat","Article","ISI"

Snails from two southern (heat tolerant) and two northern (heat sensitive) populations were acclimated to a common thermal environment, exposed to an environmentally relevant thermal stress and analysed using RNA-seq. Pooling across all populations revealed 306 genes with differential expression between control and heat-stressed samples, including 163 significantly upregulated and 143 significantly downregulated genes. When considered separately, regional differences in response were widely apparent. Heat shock proteins (Hsps) were upregulated in both regions, but the magnitude of response was significantly greater in northern populations for most Hsp70s, while the southern populations showed greater upregulation for approximately half of the Hsp40s. Of 177 stress-responsive genes in northern populations, 55 responded to heat stress only in northern populations. Several molecular chaperones and antioxidant genes that were not differentially expressed in southern populations showed higher expression under control conditions compared with northern populations. This suggests that evolution of elevated expression of these genes under benign conditions preadapts the southern populations to frequent heat stress and contributes to their higher thermal tolerance. These results indicate that evolution has resulted in different transcriptome responses across populations, including upregulation of genes in response to stress and preadaptation of genes in anticipation of stress (based on evolutionary history of frequent heat exposure). The relative importance of the two mechanisms differs among gene families and among populations.",2015,"ecological genomics; local adaptation; mollusc; rna-seq; rocky intertidal; thermal tolerance","Article","ISI"

In this investigation, evidence of balancing selection operating on conserved enhancers of the olfactory receptor (OR) genes is presented for the Chinese sleeper (Bostrychus sinensis), a coastal marine fish that is emerging as a model species for evolutionary studies in the Northwest Pacific marginal seas. Coupled with tests for Gene Ontology enrichment and transcription factor binding, population genomic data allow for the identification of an OR cluster in the sleeper with a downstream flanking region containing three enhancers that are conserved with human and other fish species. Phylogenetic and population genetic analyses indicate that the enhancers are under balancing selection as evidenced by their translineage polymorphisms, excess common alleles, and increased within-group diversities. Age comparisons between the translineage polymorphisms and most recent common ancestors of neutral genealogies substantiate that the former are old, and thus, due to ancient balancing selection. The survival and reproduction of vertebrates depend on their sense of smell, and thereby, on their ORs. In addition to locus duplication and allelic variation of structural genes, this study highlights a third mechanism by which receptor diversity can be achieved for detecting and responding to the huge variety of environmental odorants (i.e., by balancing selection acting on OR gene expression through their enhancer variability).",2021,"gene regulation; hi-c genome; northwest pacific marginal seas; olfaction; phylogeography; population genomics","Article","ISI"

Reciprocally transplanted progeny, produced by a 10 x 10 genetic cross of wild brood stock from northern and southern genetic lineages yielded significant evidence of local adaptation (interaction of genes and environment) in variables related to fitness, including survival, wet meat weight, and reproductive maturation. The strength of local adaptation was asymmetric, with greater effects on the northern compared to the southern genetic lineage. To a lesser extent, we found evidence of both the role of environment (in particular, adverse effects on both genetic crosses in the southern region), and the role of genetic differences between the 2 crosses independent of environment, with higher initial growth of the southern genetic lineage and higher condition of the northern lineage. These differences suggest that maintenance of the genetic step-cline involves natural selection. We discuss the potential role of temperature and phytoplankton community composition between the northern and southern regions. Our study is the first to determine the genetic basis for fitness-related phenotypes, and to relate this to local adaptation of the eastern oyster.

Here, we address the question whether two highly different methodsFST outlier analysis and admixture analysisdetect largely the same set of non-neutral genomic elements or, instead, complementary sets. We study genetic architecture in a natural secondary contact zone where extensive admixture occurs. The marine bivalves Macoma balthica rubra and M. b. balthica descend from two independent trans-Arctic invasions of the north Atlantic and hybridize extensively where they meet, for example in the KattegatDanish StraitsBaltic Sea region. The KattegatDanish Straits region forms a steep salinity cline and is the only entrance to the recently (ca. 8000 years ago) established brackish water basin the Baltic Sea. Salinity along the contact zone drops from 30 parts per thousand (Skagerrak, M.b.rubra) to 3 parts per thousand(Baltic, M.b.balthica). Both outlier analysis and genomic clines analysis suggest that large parts of the genome are influenced by non-neutral effects. Contrasting samples from well outside the hybrid zone, outlier analysis detects 16 of 84 amplified fragment length polymorphism markers as significant FST outliers. Genomic clines analysis detects 31 of 84 markers as non-neutral inside the hybrid zone. Remarkably, only three markers are detected by both methods. We conclude that the two methods together identify a suite of markers that are under the influence of non-neutral effects.",2012,"admixture mapping; ecological speciation; fst outliers; genomic clines; population genomics","Article","ISI"
"Population Genomic Signatures of Genetic Structure and Environmental Selection in the Catadromous Roughskin Sculpin Trachidermus fasciatus","10.1093/gbe/evz118","Li, YL; Xue, DX; Zhang, BD; Liu, JX","Understanding the patterns of genetic diversity and adaptation across species' range is crucial to assess its long-term persistence and determine appropriate conservation measures. The impacts of human activities on the genetic diversity and genetic adaptation to heterogeneous environments remain poorly understood in the marine realm. The roughskin sculpin (Trachidermus fasciatus) is a small catadromous fish, and has been listed as a second-class state protected aquatic animal since 1988 in China. To elucidate the underlying mechanism of population genetic structuring and genetic adaptations to local environments, RAD tags were sequenced for 202 individuals in nine populations across the range of T. fasciatus in China. The pairwise FST values over 9,271 filtered SNPs were significant except that between Dongying and Weifang. All the genetic clustering analysis revealed significant population structure with high support for eight distinct genetic clusters. Both the minor allele frequency spectra and Ne estimations suggested extremely small Ne in some populations (e.g., Qinhuangdao, Rongcheng, Wendeng, and Qingdao), which might result from recent population bottleneck. The strong genetic structure can be partly attributed to genetic drift and habitat fragmentation, likely due to the anthropogenic activities. Annotations of candidate adaptive loci suggested that genes involved in metabolism, development, and osmoregulation were critical for adaptation to spatially heterogenous environment of local populations. In the context of anthropogenic activities and environmental change, results of the present population genomic work provided important contributions to the understanding of genetic differentiation and adaptation to changing environments.",2019,"population structure; local adaptation; trachidermus fasciatus; habitat fragmentation; rad-seq","Article","ISI"
"Local adaptation in a marine foundation species: Implications for resilience to future global change","10.1111/gcb.16080","DuBois, K; Pollard, KN; Kauffman, BJ; Williams, SL; Stachowicz, JJ","Environmental change is multidimensional, with local anthropogenic stressors and global climate change interacting to differentially impact populations throughout a species' geographic range. Within species, the spatial distribution of phenotypic variation and its causes (i.e., local adaptation or plasticity) will determine species' adaptive capacity to respond to a changing environment. However, comparatively less is known about the spatial scale of adaptive differentiation among populations and how patterns of local adaptation might drive vulnerability to global change stressors. To test whether fine-scale (2-12 km) mosaics of environmental stress can cause adaptive differentiation in a marine foundation species, eelgrass (Zostera marina), we conducted a three-way reciprocal transplant experiment spanning the length of Tomales Bay, CA. Our results revealed strong home-site advantage in growth and survival for all three populations. In subsequent common garden experiments and feeding assays, we showed that countergradients in temperature, light availability, and grazing pressure from an introduced herbivore contribute to differential performance among populations consistent with local adaptation. Our findings highlight how local-scale mosaics in environmental stressors can increase phenotypic variation among neighboring populations, potentially increasing species resilience to future global change. More specifically, we identified a range-center eelgrass population that is pre-adapted to extremely warm temperatures similar to those experienced by low-latitude range-edge populations of eelgrass, demonstrating how reservoirs of heat-tolerant phenotypes may already exist throughout a species range. Future work on predicting species resilience to global change should incorporate potential buffering effects of local-scale population differentiation and promote a phenotypic management approach to species conservation.",2022,"common garden experiment; introduced species; local adaptation; macroalgal bloom; ocean warming; reciprocal transplant experiment; zostera marina","Article","ISI"

Variation in reproductive timing may be an especially important evolutionary driver in the marine environment, where the high mobility of many species and few physical barriers to migration provide limited opportunities for spatial divergence to arise. Using genomic data collected from spawning aggregations of Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) across 1600 km of coastline, we show that reproductive timing drives population structure in these pelagic fish. Within a specific spawning season, we observed isolation by distance, indicating that gene flow is also geographically limited over our study area. These results emphasize the importance of considering both seasonal and spatial variation in spawning when delineating management units for herring. On several chromosomes, we detected linkage disequilibrium extending over multiple Mb, suggesting the presence of chromosomal rearrangements. Spawning phenology was highly correlated with polymorphisms in several genes, in particular SYNE2, which influences the development of retinal photoreceptors in vertebrates. SYNE2 is probably within a chromosomal rearrangement in Pacific herring and is also associated with spawn timing in Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus). The observed genetic diversity probably underlies resource waves provided by spawning herring. Given the ecological, economic and cultural significance of herring, our results support that conserving intraspecific genetic diversity is important for maintaining current and future ecosystem processes.",2021,"phenology; population genomics; isolation by time; resource wave; pacific herring","Article","ISI"

On the other hand, many physical barriers distribute along the continental marginal seas and may prevent dispersals and increase population divergence. These complexities along the continental margin generate serious challenges to population genetic studies of marine species. Chinese sea bass Lateolabrax maculatus distributes broad latitudinal gradient spanning from the tropical to the mid-temperate zones in the continental margin seas of the Northwest Pacific Ocean. Using the double digest restriction-site-associated DNA tag sequencing (ddRAD) approach, we genotyped 10,297 SNPs for 219 Chinese seabass individuals of 12 populations along the Chinese coast in the Northwest Pacific region. Genetic divergence among these populations was evaluated, and population structure was established. The results suggested that geographically distant populations in the Bohai Gulf and the Beibu Gulf retain significant genetic divergence, which are connected by a series of intermediate populations in between. The results also suggested that Leizhou Peninsula, Hainan Island, and Shandong Peninsula are major physical barriers and substantially block gene flow and genetic admixture of L. maculatus. We also investigated the potential genetic basis of local adaptation correlating with population differentiation of L. maculatus. The sea surface temperature is a significantly differentiated environmental factor for the distribution of L. maculatus. The correlation of water temperature and genetic variations in extensively distributed populations was investigated with Bayesian-based approaches. The candidate genes underlying the local selection in geographically divergent populations were identified and annotated, providing clues to understand the potential mechanisms of adaptive evolution. Overall, our genome scale population genetic analysis provided insight into population divergence and local adaptation of Chinese sea bass in the continental marginal seas along Chinese coast.",2018,"chinese sea bass; marine fish; snp; local adaptation; ddrad; genetic divergence","Article","ISI"

Using a panel of microsatellite and genomewide SNP markers, we compare allele frequencies across a replicated hierarchical sampling area guided by bathymetric LiDAR imagery. Results indicate high levels of gene flow and no significant genetic structure within or between benthic reef habitats across 1400 km of coastline. These findings differ to those reported for other regions of the fishery indicating that larval supply is likely to be spatially variable, with implications for management and long-term recovery from stock depletion.

Such observations suggest isolation at small scales may play an important role in forming patterns of genetic diversity within species. Isolation-by-distance, isolation-by-environment and historical priority effects are umbrella terms for a suite of processes that underlie genetic structure, but their relative importance at different spatial and temporal scales remains elusive. Here, we use marine lakes in Indonesia to assess genetic structure and assess the relative roles of the processes in shaping genetic differentiation in populations of a bivalve mussel (Brachidontes sp.). Marine lakes are landlocked waterbodies of similar age (6,000-10,000 years), but with heterogeneous environments and varying degrees of connection to the sea. Using a population genomic approach (double-digest restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing), we show strong genetic structuring across populations (range F-ST: 0.07-0.24) and find limited gene flow through admixture plots. At large spatial scales (>1,400 km), a clear isolation-by-distance pattern was detected. At smaller spatial scales (<200 km), this pattern is maintained, but accompanied by an association of genetic divergence with degree of connection. We hypothesize that (incomplete) dispersal barriers can cause initial isolation, allowing priority effects to give the numerical advantage necessary to initiate strong genetic structure. Priority effects may be strengthened by local adaptation, which the data may corroborate by showing a high correlation between mussel genotypes and temperature. Our study indicates an often-neglected role of (evolution-mediated) priority effects in shaping population divergence.",2018,"ddrad-seq; isolation by distance; isolation by environment; marine biodiversity; population genomics; priority effects","Article","ISI"
"Population genomics of local adaptation versus speciation in coral reef fishes (Hypoplectrus spp, Serranidae)","10.1002/ece3.2028","Picq, S; McMillan, WO; Puebla, O","Are the population genomic patterns underlying local adaptation and the early stages of speciation similar? Addressing this question requires a system in which (i) local adaptation and the early stages of speciation can be clearly identified and distinguished, (ii) the amount of genetic divergence driven by the two processes is similar, and (iii) comparisons can be repeated both taxonomically (for local adaptation) and geographically (for speciation). Here, we report just such a situation in the hamlets (Hypoplectrus spp), brightly colored reef fishes from the wider Caribbean. Close to 100,000 SNPs genotyped in 126 individuals from three sympatric species sampled in three repeated populations provide genome-wide levels of divergence that are comparable among allopatric populations (F-st estimate=0.0042) and sympatric species (F-st estimate=0.0038). Population genetic, clustering, and phylogenetic analyses reveal very similar patterns for local adaptation and speciation, with a large fraction of the genome undifferentiated (F-st estimate approximate to 0), a very small proportion of F-st outlier loci (0.05-0.07%), and remarkably few repeated outliers (1-3). Nevertheless, different loci appear to be involved in the two processes in Hypoplectrus, with only 7% of the most differentiated SNPs and outliers shared between populations and species comparisons. In particular, a tropomyosin (Tpm4) and a previously identified hox (HoxCa) locus emerge as candidate loci (repeated outliers) for local adaptation and speciation, respectively. We conclude that marine populations may be locally adapted notwithstanding shallow levels of genetic divergence, and that from a population genomic perspective, this process does not appear to differ fundamentally from the early stages of speciation.",2016,"fish; local adaptation; marine; rad sequencing; speciation","Article","ISI"

We analysed 607 individuals from 18 spawning locations in the northeast Atlantic, including two temperature clines (512 degrees C) and two salinity clines (535 parts per thousand). By combining genome scan and landscape genetic analyses, four genetically distinct groups of herring were identified: Baltic Sea, BalticNorth Sea transition area, North Sea/British Isles and North Atlantic; notably, samples exhibited divergent clustering patterns for neutral and selected loci. We found statistically strong evidence for divergent selection at 16 outlier loci on a global scale, and significant correlations with temperature and salinity at nine loci. On regional scales, we identified two outlier loci with parallel patterns across temperature clines and five loci associated with temperature in the North Sea/North Atlantic. Likewise, we found seven replicated outliers, of which five were significantly associated with low salinity across both salinity clines.

"Effect of tidal regime on the thermal tolerance of the marine gastropod Lunella smaragda (Gmelin 1791)","10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.07.009","Mortensen, BJD; Dunphy, BJ","The tidal cycle around New Zealand results in spring low tides consistently occurring during the hottest part of the day (mid-afternoon) in north-eastern New Zealand, and during the cooler dawn/dusk periods in the north-west of the country. We hypothesised that due to mid-afternoon spring low tides, intertidal populations residing at north-eastern sites would show greater thermotolerance than their north-west conspecifics. To test this we used the marine gastropod, Lunella smaragda, which were collected from sites on both the East and West coasts of the Auckland region and exposed to an acute heat shock. Thermotolerance was measured as survivorship (LT50), drop down time (time to heat coma) and thermal stability of the anaerobic energy producing enzyme Tauropine dehydrogenase. Furthermore, temperature loggers were deployed at each site so as to record and compare thermal regimes among sites. A strong temperature spike associated with spring low tide was found at all sites, and maximal temperatures of all East coast sites were higher than West coast sites (in some case by up to 10 degrees C). In terms of thermotolerance, mortality of L. smaragda occurred at 42 degrees C leading to 100% mortality at 45 degrees C. However, comparison of LT50 showed snails were equally thermotolerant regardless of site of collection. Similar results were found in TDH thermal stability with animals from all sites showing an approximately 80% decrease in enzyme activity after 10 min exposure to 42 degrees C. Whilst drop down times were different among sites these were correlated with animal size as opposed to site of collection. Thus, East coast populations of L. smaragda appear no more thermotolerant than their West coast counterparts. Such a result is concerning as maximal temperatures at East coast sites already exceed the LT50 values of L. smaragda recorded in the lab suggesting these populations have less of a thermal safety margin.

"Evolution of population structure in an estuarine-dependent marine fish","10.1002/ece3.4936","Hollenbeck, CM; Portnoy, DS; Gold, JR","Restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing was used to characterize neutral and adaptive genetic variation among geographic samples of red drum, Sciaenops ocellatus, an estuarine-dependent fish found in coastal waters along the southeastern coast of the United States (Atlantic) and the northern Gulf of Mexico (Gulf). Analyses of neutral and outlier loci revealed three genetically distinct regional clusters: one in the Atlantic and two in the northern Gulf. Divergence in neutral loci indicated gradual genetic change and followed a linear pattern of isolation by distance. Divergence in outlier loci was at least an order of magnitude greater than divergence in neutral loci, and divergence between the regions in the Gulf was twice that of divergence between other regions. Discordance in patterns of genetic divergence between outlier and neutral loci is consistent with the hypothesis that the former reflects adaptive responses to environmental factors that vary on regional scales, while the latter largely reflects drift processes. Differences in basic habitat, initiated by glacial retreat and perpetuated by contemporary oceanic and atmospheric forces interacting with the geomorphology of the northern Gulf, followed by selection, appear to have led to reduced gene flow among red drum across the northern Gulf, reinforcing differences accrued during isolation and resulting in continued divergence across the genome. This same dynamic also may pertain to other coastal or nearshore fishes (18 species in 14 families) where genetically or morphologically defined sister taxa occur in the three regions.",2019,"historical biogeography; isolation by adaptation; population genomics; radseq","Article","ISI"

We hypothesize that populations from Arctic and cold-temperate locations are less heat resilient than populations from warm distributional edges. Using meristems of naturalL. digitatapopulations from six locations ranging between Kongsfjorden, Spitsbergen (79 degrees N), and Quiberon, France (47 degrees N), we performed a common-garden heat stress experiment applying 15 degrees C to 23 degrees C over eight days. We assessed growth, photosynthetic quantum yield, carbon and nitrogen storage, and xanthophyll pigment contents as response traits. Population connectivity and genetic diversity were analyzed with microsatellite markers. Results from the heat stress experiment suggest that the upper temperature limit ofL. digitatais nearly identical across its distribution range, but subtle differences in growth and stress responses were revealed for three populations from the species' ecological range margins. Two populations at the species' warm distribution limit showed higher temperature tolerance compared to other populations in growth at 19 degrees C and recovery from 21 degrees C (Quiberon, France), and photosynthetic quantum yield and xanthophyll pigment responses at 23 degrees C (Helgoland, Germany). InL. digitatafrom the northernmost population (Spitsbergen, Norway), quantum yield indicated the highest heat sensitivity. Microsatellite genotyping revealed all sampled populations to be genetically distinct, with a strong hierarchical structure between southern and northern clades. Genetic diversity was lowest in the isolated population of the North Sea island of Helgoland and highest in Roscoff in the English Channel.

For this reason, the European Union Habitat Directive included them among priority habitats to be preserved. Although their ecological role is well established, connectivity patterns are still poorly investigated, representing a limit in conservation planning. The present study pioneers a novel approach for the analysis of connectivity in marine bioconstructor species, which often lack suitable genetic markers, by taking advantage of next-generation sequencing techniques. We assess the geographical patterns of genomic variation of the sunset cup coral Leptopsammia pruvoti Lacaze-Duthiers, 1897, an ahermatypic, non-zooxanthellate and solitary scleractinian coral species common in coralligenous habitats and distributed across the Mediterranean Sea. Location The Italian coastline (Western and Central Mediterranean). Methods We applied the restriction site-associated 2b-RAD approach to genotype over 1,000 high-quality and filtered single nucleotide polymorphisms in 10 population samples. Results The results revealed the existence of a strongly supported genetic structure, with highly significant pairwise F-ST values between all the population samples, including those collected about 5 km apart from each other. Moreover, genomic data indicate that the strongest barriers to gene flow are between the western (Ligurian-Tyrrhenian Sea) and the eastern side (Adriatic Sea) of the Italian peninsula. Main conclusions The strong differentiation found in L. pruvoti is similar to that found in other species of marine bioconstructors investigated in this area, but it strongly contrasts with the small differences found in many fish and invertebrates at the same geographical scale.

"Concordant geographic and genetic structure revealed by genotyping-by-sequencing in a New Zealand marine isopod","10.1002/ece3.6802","Pearman, WS; Wells, SJ; Silander, OK; Freed, NE; Dale, J","Population genetic structure in the marine environment can be influenced by life-history traits such as developmental mode (biphasic, with distinct adult and larval morphology, and direct development, in which larvae resemble adults) or habitat specificity, as well as geography and selection. Developmental mode is thought to significantly influence dispersal, with direct developers expected to have much lower dispersal potential. However, this prediction can be complicated by the presence of geophysical barriers to dispersal. In this study, we use a panel of 8,020 SNPs to investigate population structure and biogeography over multiple spatial scales for a direct-developing species, the New Zealand endemic marine isopod Isocladus armatus. Because our sampling range is intersected by two well-known biogeographic barriers (the East Cape and the Cook Strait), our study provides an opportunity to understand how such barriers influence dispersal in direct developers. On a small spatial scale (20 km), gene flow between locations is extremely high, suggestive of an island model of migration. However, over larger spatial scales (600 km), populations exhibit a clear pattern of isolation-by-distance. Our results indicate that I. armatus exhibits significant migration across the hypothesized barriers and suggest that large-scale ocean currents associated with these locations do not present a barrier to dispersal. Interestingly, we find evidence of a north-south population genetic break occurring between Mahia and Wellington. While no known geophysical barrier is apparent in this area, it coincides with the location of a proposed border between bioregions. Analysis of loci under selection revealed that both isolation-by-distance and adaption may be contributing to the degree of population structure we have observed here. We conclude that developmental life history largely predicts dispersal in the intertidal isopod I. armatus. However, localized biogeographic processes can disrupt this expectation, and this may explain the potential meta-population detected in the Auckland region.",2020,"evolution; genetics; genomics; genotyping&#8208; by&#8208; sequencing; isolation&#8208; by&#8208; adaptation; isolation&#8208; by&#8208; distance; isopod; population; radseq","Article","ISI"

We characterized patterns of genetic diversity and connectivity using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in two reef-building corals to explore the eco-evolutionary processes that sustain populations in north-west Australia. Our sampling focused on the unique reefs of the Kimberley; we collected the broadcast spawning coralAcropora aspera(n = 534) and the brooding coralIsopora brueggemanni(n = 612) across inter-archipelago (tens to hundreds of kilometres), inter-reef (kilometres to tens of kilometres) and within-reef (tens of metres to a few kilometres) scales. Initial analysis ofA. asperaidentified four highly divergent lineages that were co-occurring but morphologically similar. Subsequent population analyses focused on the most abundant and widespread lineage,Acroporaasp-c. Although the overall level of geographic subdivision was greater in the brooder than in the spawner, fundamental similarities in patterns of genetic structure were evident. Most notably, limits to gene flow were observed at scales <35 kilometres. Further, we observed four discrete clusters and a semi-permeable barrier to dispersal that were geographically consistent between species. Finally, sites experiencing bigger tides were more connected to the metapopulation and had greater gene diversity than those experiencing smaller tides. Our data indicate that the inshore reefs of the Kimberley are genetically isolated from neighbouring oceanic bioregions, but occasional dispersal between inshore archipelagos is important for the redistribution of evolutionarily important genetic diversity. Additionally, these results suggest that networks of marine reserves that effectively protect reefs from local pressures should be spaced within a few tens of kilometres to conserve the existing patterns of demographic and genetic connectivity.",2020,"acropora aspera; conservation genomics; isopora brueggemanni; marine reserve networks; population connectivity; single nucleotide polymorphism","Article","ISI"

Specifically, we compared samples collected during expected- and late-season recruitment time periods within 2 consecutive years (2017 and 2018) at 2 sites in Oregon, USA (Yaquina Bay and Coos Bay). Evidence was found for high gene flow between the expected- and late-season recruits within each year and at both sites based on 1389 neutral loci. In contrast, strong genetic differentiation was observed between these 2 groups within each year and at both sites based on variation at 2 putatively adaptive loci. Contrary to prediction, the magnitude of genetic differentiation between these 2 seasonal groups was greater in 2017 when the Pacific Decadal Oscillation was stronger, upwelling was weaker, and the spring transition was later. Spatial genetic variation was not observed within 2017 or 2018. Comparing across years, expected- and late-season groups were differentiated at putatively adaptive loci. Interestingly, strong genetic differentiation was also observed between late-season groups across years.

Theory predicts that divergence can happen with full range overlap - in sympatry - driven by ecological factors, but there are few empirical examples of how ecologically divergent selection can overcome gene flow and lead to reproductive isolation. In the marine midge Clunio marinus (Diptera: Chironomidae) reproduction is ecologically restricted to the time of the lowest tides, which is ensured through accurate control of development and adult emergence by circalunar and circadian clocks. As tidal regimes differ along the coastline, locally adapted timing strains of C. marinus are found in different sites across Europe. At the same time, ecologically suitable low tides occur at both full and new moon and twice a day, providing C. marinus with four nonoverlapping temporal niches at every geographic location. Along the coast of Brittany, which is characterized by a steep gradient in timing of the tides, we found an unusually large number of differentially adapted timing strains, and the first known instances of sympatric C. marinus strains occupying divergent temporal niches. Analysis of mitochondrial genotypes suggests that these timing strains originated from a single recent colonization event. Nuclear genotypes show strong gene flow, sympatric timing strains being the least differentiated. Even when sympatric strains exist in nonoverlapping temporal niches, timing adaptations do not result in genome-wide genetic divergence, suggesting timing adaptations are maintained by permanent ecological selection. This constitutes a model case for incipient ecological divergence with gene flow.",2021,"allochrony; circadian clocks; circalunar clocks; ecological speciation; local adaptation; sympatric speciation","Article","ISI"

Furthermore, structural variation as chromosomal rearrangements may facilitate adaptation despite high gene flow. However, our understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms impending or favouring local adaptation in the presence of gene flow is still limited to a restricted number of study systems. In this study, we examined how demographic history, shared ancestral polymorphism, arid gene flow among glacial lineages contribute to local adaptation to sea conditions in a marine fish, the capelin (Mallotus villosus). We first assembled a 490-Mbp draft genome of M. villosus to map our RAD sequence reads. Then, we used a large data set of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (25,904 filtered SNPs) genotyped in 1,310 individuals collected from 31 spawning sites in the northwest Atlantic. We reconstructed the history of divergence among three glacial lineages and showed that they probably diverged from 3.8 to 1.8 million years ago and experienced secondary contacts. Within each lineage, our analyses provided evidence for large N e and high gene flow among spawning sites. Within the Northwest Atlantic lineage, we detected a polymorphic chromosomal rearrangement leading to the occurrence of three haplogroups. Genotype-environment associations revealed molecular signatures of local adaptation to environmental conditions prevailing at spawning sites. Our study also suggests that both shared polymorphisms among lineages, resulting from standing genetic variation or introgression, and chromosomal rearrangements may contribute to local adaptation in the presence of high gene flow.",2020,"delta a delta i; fish; inversion; joint site frequency spectrum; mallotus villosus; population genomics; rad; speciation","Article","ISI"
"Local adaptation of phenology revealed in outcrosses between spawning segments of a salmonid population","10.1111/mec.14908","Manhard, CV; Adkison, MD; Hard, JJ; Smoker, WW; Gharrett, AJ","Local adaptation has been demonstrated in spatially or temporally distant animal populations but seldom in proximate populations. To address the scale of local adaptation in Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), two generations of hybrids between temporally separated spawning segments were made in a population of pink salmon (O. gorbuscha) and compared with controls to evaluate the genetic architecture underlying adult migration time and to test for declines in marine survival that resulted from outbreeding depression. Bayesian mixed-effects models revealed that adult migration times in hybrid lines were intermediate to those of controls and that additive sources of genetic variation were significant, thereby indicating that local adaptation has acted on additive genetic variation in shaping this trait. Similarly, a line cross analysis revealed that an additive model best described the genetic architecture of adult migration time. In contrast, marine survival was generally similar between control and hybrid lines, which suggested that the effect of outbreeding upon marine survival was minimal at such a fine scale of genetic divergence. The implications of these results are that (a) local adaptation can facilitate genetic divergence of life history traits between proximate subpopulations; (b) artificial relaxation of natural barriers to gene flow can cause maladaptive shifts in life history traits; and (c) wild populations may harbour fine-scale adaptive variation that supports productivity and sustainability.",2018,"biodiversity; local adaptation; marine survival; migration time; outbreeding depression; quantitative genetics","Article","ISI"
"Master of all trades: thermal acclimation and adaptation of cardiac function in a broadly distributed marine invasive species, the European green crab, Carcinus maenas","10.1242/jeb.093849","Tepolt, CK; Somero, GN","As global warming accelerates, there is increasing concern about how ecosystems may change as a result of species loss and replacement. Here, we examined the thermal physiology of the European green crab (Carcinus maenas Linnaeus 1758), a globally invasive species, along three parallel thermal gradients in its native and invasive ranges. At each site, we assessed cardiac physiology to determine heat and cold tolerance and acclimatory plasticity. We found that, overall, the species is highly tolerant of both heat and cold, and that it survives higher temperatures than co-occurring native marine crustaceans. Further, we found that both heat and cold tolerance are plastic in response to short-term acclimation (18-31 days at either 5 or 25 degrees C). Comparing patterns within ranges, we found latitudinal gradients in thermal tolerance in the native European range and in the invasive range in eastern North America. This pattern is strongest in the native range, and likely evolved there. Because of a complicated invasion history, the latitudinal pattern in the eastern North American invasive range may be due either to rapid adaptation post-invasion or to adaptive differences between the ancestral populations that founded the invasion. Overall, the broad thermal tolerance ranges of green crabs, which may facilitate invasion of novel habitats, derive from high inherent eurythermality and acclimatory plasticity and potentially adaptive differentiation among populations. The highly flexible physiology that results from these capacities may represent the hallmark of a successful invasive species, and may provide a model for success in a changing world.",2014,"acclimatory plasticity; cardiac physiology; local adaptation; species invasion; thermal tolerance","Article","ISI"
"Evidence for adaptive phenotypic differentiation in Baltic Sea sticklebacks","10.1111/jeb.12168","DeFaveri, J; Merila, J","The evidence for adaptive phenotypic differentiation in mobile marine species remains scarce, partly due to the difficulty of obtaining quantitative genetic data to demonstrate the genetic basis of the observed phenotypic differentiation. Using a combination of phenotypic and molecular genetic approaches, we elucidated the relative roles of natural selection and genetic drift in explaining lateral plate number differentiation in threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) across the entire Baltic Sea basin (approximately 392000km(2)). We found that phenotypic differentiation (P-ST=0.213) in plate number exceeded that in neutral markers (F-ST=0.008), suggesting an adaptive basis for the observed differentiation. Because a close correspondence was found between plate phenotype and genotype at a quantitative trait loci (QTL; STN381) tightly linked to the gene (Ectodysplasin) underlying plate variation, the evidence for adaptive differentiation was confirmed by comparison of F-ST at the QTL (F-STQ=0.089) with F-ST at neutral marker loci. Hence, the results provide a comprehensive demonstration of adaptive phenotypic differentiation in a high-gene-flow marine environment with direct, rather than inferred, verification for the genetic basis of this differentiation. In general, the results illustrate the utility of P-ST-F-ST-F-STQ comparisons in uncovering footprints of natural selection and evolution and add to the growing evidence for adaptive genetic differentiation in high-gene-flow marine environments, including that of the relatively young Baltic Sea.",2013,"local adaptation; marine; outlier detection; phenotypic divergence; quantitative trait locus","Article","ISI"
"High degree of cryptic population differentiation in the Baltic Sea herring Clupea harengus","10.1111/mec.12174","Corander, J; Majander, KK; Cheng, L; Merila, J","Marine fish species are characterized by a low degree of population differentiation at putatively neutral marker genes. This has been traditionally attributed to ecological homogeneity and a lack of obvious dispersal barriers in marine habitats, as well as to the large (effective) population sizes of most marine fish species. The herring (Clupea harengus) is a case in point - the levels of population differentiation at neutral markers, even across vast geographic areas, are typically very low (FST approximate to 0.005). We used a RAD-sequencing approach to identify 5985 novel single-nucleotide polymorphism markers (SNPs) in herring and estimated genome-wide levels of divergence using pooled DNA samples between two Baltic Sea populations separated by 387km. We found a total of 4756 divergent SNPs (79% of all SNPs) between the populations, of which 117 showed evidence of substantial divergence, corresponding to FST=0.128 (0.125, 0.131) after accounting for possible biases due to minor alleles and uneven DNA amplification over the pooled samples. This estimate - based on screening many genomic polymorphisms - suggests the existence of hitherto unrecognized levels of genetic differentiation in this commercially important species, challenging the view of genetic homogeneity in marine fish species, and in that of the Baltic Sea herring in particular.",2013,"fish; f st; population genomics; rad-seq; single-nucleotide polymorphism marker","Article","ISI"
"Limited potential for adaptation to climate change in a broadly distributed marine crustacean","10.1098/rspb.2011.0542","Kelly, MW; Sanford, E; Grosberg, RK","The extent to which acclimation and genetic adaptation might buffer natural populations against climate change is largely unknown. Most models predicting biological responses to environmental change assume that species' climatic envelopes are homogeneous both in space and time. Although recent discussions have questioned this assumption, few empirical studies have characterized intraspecific patterns of genetic variation in traits directly related to environmental tolerance limits. We test the extent of such variation in the broadly distributed tidepool copepod Tigriopus californicus using laboratory rearing and selection experiments to quantify thermal tolerance and scope for adaptation in eight populations spanning more than 17 degrees of latitude. Tigriopus californicus exhibit striking local adaptation to temperature, with less than 1 per cent of the total quantitative variance for thermal tolerance partitioned within populations. Moreover, heat-tolerant phenotypes observed in low-latitude populations cannot be achieved in high-latitude populations, either through acclimation or 10 generations of strong selection. Finally, in four populations there was no increase in thermal tolerance between generations 5 and 10 of selection, suggesting that standing variation had already been depleted. Thus, plasticity and adaptation appear to have limited capacity to buffer these isolated populations against further increases in temperature. Our results suggest that models assuming a uniform climatic envelope may greatly underestimate extinction risk in species with strong local adaptation.",2012,"climate envelope model; local adaptation; thermal tolerance; experimental evolution","Article","ISI"

I also examined the influence of constitutive and inducible shell morphology on resistance to crushing. 4. Regardless of the presence of crabs, snails from high-risk (HR) habitats developed rotund, short-spired shells, while snails from low-risk habitats developed elongate shells, tall-spired shells, indicating among-habitat divergence in constitutive shell shape. Moreover, allometry analyses indicated that constitutive developmental patterns underlying this variation also differed between habitats. However, snails from HR habitats showed greater plasticity for apertural lip thickness and apertural area in the presence of crab cues, indicating among-habitat variation in defence inducibility. 5.

"Swept away: ocean currents and seascape features influence genetic structure across the 18,000 Km Indo-Pacific distribution of a marine invertebrate, the black-lip pearl oyster Pinctada margaritifera","10.1186/s12864-016-3410-y","Lal, MM; Southgate, PC; Jerry, DR; Bosserelle, C; Zenger, KR","Background: Genetic structure in many widely-distributed broadcast spawning marine invertebrates remains poorly understood, posing substantial challenges for their fishery management, conservation and aquaculture. Under the Core-Periphery Hypothesis (CPH), genetic diversity is expected to be highest at the centre of a species' distribution, progressively decreasing with increased differentiation towards outer range limits, as populations become increasingly isolated, fragmented and locally adapted. The unique life history characteristics of many marine invertebrates such as high dispersal rates, stochastic survival and variable recruitment are also likely to influence how populations are organised. To examine the microevolutionary forces influencing population structure, connectivity and adaptive variation in a highly-dispersive bivalve, populations of the black-lip pearl oyster Pinctada margaritifera were examined across its similar to 18,000 km Indo-Pacific distribution. Results: Analyses utilising 9,624 genome-wide SNPs and 580 oysters, discovered differing patterns of significant and substantial broad-scale genetic structure between the Indian and Pacific Ocean basins. Indian Ocean populations were markedly divergent (F-st = 0.2534-0.4177, p < 0.001), compared to Pacific Ocean oysters, where basin-wide gene flow was much higher (F-st = 0.0007-0.1090, p < 0.001). Partitioning of genetic diversity (hierarchical AMOVA) attributed 18.1% of variance between ocean basins, whereas greater proportions were resolved within samples and populations (45.8% and 35.7% respectively). Visualisation of population structure at selectively neutral loci resolved three and five discrete genetic clusters for the Indian and Pacific Oceans respectively. Evaluation of genetic structure at adaptive loci for Pacific populations (89 SNPs under directional selection; Fst = 0.1012-0.4371, FDR = 0.05), revealed five clusters identical to those detected at neutral SNPs, suggesting environmental heterogeneity within the Pacific. Patterns of structure and connectivity were supported by Mantel tests of isolation by distance (IBD) and independent hydrodynamic particle dispersal simulations. Conclusions: It is evident that genetic structure and connectivity across the natural range of P. margaritifera is highly complex, and produced by the interaction of ocean currents, IBD and seascape features at a broad scale, together with habitat geomorphology and local adaptation at regional levels. Overall population organisation is far more elaborate than generalised CPH predictions, however valuable insights for regional fishery management, and a greater understanding of range-wide genetic structure in a highly-dispersive marine invertebrate have been gained.",2017,"population genomics; aquaculture; core-periphery hypothesis; snp; hydrodynamic dispersal; species distribution","Article","ISI"

Differentiation among locations with 891 neutral SNPs was low (F-ST = 0.005). Higher differentiation was obtained with a panel of 58 putative outlier SNPs (F-ST = 0.114) indicating the potential for local adaptation. This panel identified clusters of genetically related individuals and demonstrated that much of the differentiation (similar to 92%) could be attributed to the three major regions and environments: extreme conditions in Patagonia, inner bay influenced by aquaculture (Reloncavi), and outer bay (Chiloe Island). Patagonia samples were most distinct, but additional analysis carried out excluding this collection also revealed adaptive divergence between inner and outer bay samples. The four locations within Reloncavi area were most similar with all panels of markers, likely due to similar environments, high gene flow by aquaculture practices, and low geographical distance.

These genomic islands of adaptive divergence can inform conservation efforts in exploited species, by refining the delineation of management units, and providing genomic tools for more precise and effective population monitoring and the successful assignment of individuals and products. We explored heterogeneity in genomic divergence and its impact on the resolution of spatial population structure in exploited populations of Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua, using genome wide expressed sequence derived single nucleotide polymorphisms in 466 individuals sampled across the range. Outlier tests identified elevated divergence at 5.2% of SNPs, consistent with directional selection in one-third of linkage groups. Genomic regions of elevated divergence ranged in size from a single position to several cM. Structuring at neutral loci was associated with geographic features, whereas outlier SNPs revealed genetic discontinuities in both the eastern and western Atlantic. This fine-scale geographic differentiation enhanced assignment to region of origin, and through the identification of adaptive diversity, fundamentally changes how these populations should be conserved.

Sea scallops span a broad latitudinal area (>10 degrees), and we hypothesized that climatic variation significantly drives clinal trends in allele frequency. Using a large environmental dataset, including temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a, and nutrient concentrations, we identified a suite of SNPs (285-621, depending on analysis and environmental dataset) potentially under selection through correlations with environmental variation. Principal components analysis of different outlier SNPs and environmental datasets revealed similar northern and southern clusters, with significant associations between the first axes of each (R-adj(2)=.66-.79). Multivariate redundancy analysis of outlier SNPs and the environmental principal components indicated that environmental factors explained more than 32% of the variance. Similarly, multiple linear regressions and random-forest analysis identified winter average and minimum ocean temperatures as significant parameters in the link between genetic and environmental variation.

"Population genomic evidence for adaptive differentiation in the Baltic Sea herring","10.1111/mec.13657","Guo, BC; Li, ZT; Merila, J","Detecting and estimating the degree of genetic differentiation among populations of highly mobile marine fish having pelagic larval stages is challenging because their effective population sizes can be large, and thus, little genetic drift and differentiation is expected in neutral genomic sites. However, genomic sites subject to directional selection stemming from variation in local environmental conditions can still show substantial genetic differentiation, yet these signatures can be hard to detect with low-throughput approaches. Using a pooled RAD-seq approach, we investigated genomewide patterns of genetic variability and differentiation within and among 20 populations of Atlantic herring in the Baltic Sea (and adjacent Atlantic sites), where previous low-throughput studies and/or studies based on few populations have found limited evidence for genetic differentiation. Stringent quality control was applied in the filtering of 1 791 254 SNPs, resulting in a final data set of 68 182 polymorphic loci. Clear differentiation was identified between Atlantic and Baltic populations in many genomic sites, while differentiation within the Baltic Sea area was weaker and geographically less structured. However, outlier analyses - whether including all populations or only those within the Baltic Sea uncovered hundreds of directionally selected loci in which variability was associated with either salinity, temperature or both. Hence, our results support the view that although the degree of genetic differentiation among Baltic Sea herring populations is low, there are many genomic regions showing elevated divergence, apparently as a response to temperature-and salinity-related natural selection. As such, the results add to the increasing evidence of local adaptation in highly mobile marine organisms, and those in the young Baltic Sea in particular.",2016,"clupea harengus; local adaptation; rad-seq; salinity; snp; temperature","Article","ISI"

In addition to previously described Crab and Wave ecotypes, we studied a new phenotype (Crab + ) associated to the most sheltered habitats of the gradient. We obtained estimates of heritability and Q(st) (between population genetic differentiation) in embryos and P-st (between population phenotypic differentiation) in adults for shell morphology traits. Heritability estimates were close to one for shell size and relative shell aperture, suggesting a low impact of environmental factors in embryos. Estimates of Q(st) between ecotypes were significant and typically much higher than published F-st estimates from neutral markers, indicating a role for selection on shaping additive genetic variation. Estimates of P-st between ecotypes for adults were substantially larger than embryos' Q(st) suggesting also a role of phenotypic plasticity in ecotype differentiation.

"Natural variation and the capacity to adapt to ocean acidification in the keystone sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus","10.1111/gcb.12251","Kelly, MW; Padilla-Gamino, JL; Hofmann, GE","A rapidly growing body of literature documents the potential negative effects of CO2-driven ocean acidification (OA) on marine organisms. However, nearly all this work has focused on the effects of future conditions on modern populations, neglecting the role of adaptation. Rapid evolution can alter demographic responses to environmental change, ultimately affecting the likelihood of population persistence, but the capacity for adaptation will differ among populations and species. Here, we measure the capacity of the ecologically important purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus to adapt to OA, using a breeding experiment to estimate additive genetic variance for larval size (an important component of fitness) under future high-pCO(2)/low-pH conditions. Although larvae reared under future conditions were smaller than those reared under present-day conditions, we show that there is also abundant genetic variation for body size under elevated pCO(2), indicating that this trait can evolve. The observed heritability of size was 0.40 +/- 0.32 (95% CI) under low pCO(2), and 0.50 +/- 0.30 under high-pCO(2) conditions. Accounting for the observed genetic variation in models of future larval size and demographic rates substantially alters projections of performance for this species in the future ocean. Importantly, our model shows that after incorporating the effects of adaptation, the OA-driven decrease in population growth rate is up to 50% smaller, than that predicted by the no-adaptation' scenario. Adults used in the experiment were collected from two sites on the coast of the Northeast Pacific that are characterized by different pH regimes, as measured by autonomous sensors. Comparing results between sites, we also found subtle differences in larval size under high-pCO(2) rearing conditions, consistent with local adaptation to carbonate chemistry in the field.

We determined that mussels exposed to river-influenced conditions had increased metabolic rates and reduced growth rates, as compared to mussels experiencing marine conditions (p < 0.05). While the energy investment strategies of the 2 local populations resulted in similar net calcification rates, these rates decreased significantly when mussels were transplanted to the river-influenced site. Stressful conditions at the river-influenced site were evidenced by decreased survivorship across treatments. Freshwater inputs modify the organic composition of the shell periostracum through a significant reduction in polysaccharides. Although our field experiment did not identify specific environmental factors underlying these contrasting phenotypic changes, the results imply that plasticity plays a strong role when P. purpuratus is exposed to some combination of natural (e.g. salinity) and anthropogenic influences (e.g. pollution), and that the lack of exposure to freshwater may promote less tolerant mussels with greater potential for local adaptation.",2016,"calcification; shell periostracum; metabolism; local adaptation; central chile; perumytilus purpuratus","Article","ISI"
"Body size affects individual winter foraging strategies of thick-billed murres in the Bering Sea","10.1111/1365-2656.12410","Orben, RA; Paredes, R; Roby, DD; Irons, DB; Shaffer, SA","Foraging and migration often require different energetic and movement strategies. Though not readily apparent, constraints during one phase might influence the foraging strategies observed in another. For marine birds that fly and dive, body size constraints likely present a trade-off between foraging ability and migration as smaller bodies reduce flight costs, whereas larger bodies are advantageous for diving deeper. This study examines individual wintering strategies of deep diving thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia) breeding at three colonies in the south-eastern Bering Sea: St Paul, St George and Bogoslof. These colonies, arranged north to south, are located such that breeding birds forage in a gradient from shelf to deep-water habitats. We used geolocation time-depth recorders and stable isotopes from feathers to determine differences in foraging behaviour and diet of murres during three non-breeding periods, 2008-2011. Body size was quantified by a principal component analysis (wing, culmen, head+bill and tarsus length). A hierarchical cluster analysis identified winter foraging strategies based on individual movement, diving behaviour and diet (inferred from stable isotopes). Structural body size differed by breeding island. Larger birds from St Paul had higher wing loading than smaller birds from St George. Larger birds, mainly from St Paul, dove to deeper depths, spent more time in the Bering Sea, and likely consumed higher trophic-level prey in late winter. Three winter foraging strategies were identified. The main strategy, employed by small birds from all three breeding colonies in the first 2years, was characterized by high residency areas in the North Pacific south of the Aleutians and nocturnal diving. In contrast, 31% of birds from St Paul remained in the Bering Sea and foraged mainly during the day, apparently feeding on higher trophic-level prey. Throat feather stable isotopes indicated that individuals exhibited flexibility in the use of this colony-specific foraging strategy. The third strategy only occurred in 2010/2011, when birds dove more and deeper, suggesting limited prey resources. Foraging strategies partitioned with respect to annual differences, presumably in response to shifts in distribution of prey, and were linked to body size. The presence of a colony-specific wintering strategy suggests the potential for overwinter survival differences between these populations.",2015,"bering sea; body size; foraging strategies; geolocation; local adaptation; marine habitats; stable isotopes; uria lomvia; winter migration","Article","ISI"

Here, we hypothesize that the barriers to dispersal created by large oceanic expanses and deep-water trenches result in a heterogeneous distribution of the neutral genetic diversity between island bull shark populations compared to populations sampled in continental locations connected through continuous coastlines of continental shelves. We analyzed 1,494 high-quality neutral single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in 215 individual bull sharks from widespread locations across the Indian and Pacific Oceans (South Africa, Indonesia, Western Australia, Papua New Guinea, eastern Australia, New Caledonia, and Fiji). Genomic analyses revealed partitioning between remote insular and continental populations, with the Fiji population being genetically different from all other locations sampled (F-ST = 0.034-0.044, P < 0.001), and New Caledonia showing marginal isolation (F-ST = 0.016-0.024, P < 0.001; albeit based on a small sample size) from most sampled sites. Discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) identified samples from Fiji as a distinct cluster with all other sites clustering together. Genetic structure analyses (Admixture, fastStructure and AssignPOP) further supported the genetic isolation of bull sharks from Fiji, with the analyses in agreement. The observed differentiation in bull sharks from Fiji makes this site of special interest, as it indicates a lack of migration through dispersal across deep-water trenches and large ocean expanses.",2020,"island populations; connectivity; coastal sharks; shark reef marine reserve; population genomics; dispersal barriers","Article","ISI"

The number of the Japanese eels has been dramatically declining over the last four decades, and it is now listed as an endangered species (International Union for Conservation of Nature [IUCN] 2014). To manage and conserve this endangered species, it is necessary to assess population genetic diversity, genetic structure, and identify regions of the genomes that are under selection. Here, we generated a catalog of novel single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for the Japanese eel using restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing of 24 individuals from two geographic locations. The 73,557 identified SNPs were widely distributed across the draft genome of the Japanese eel. No genetic differentiation between the two populations was detected based on all loci or neutral loci. However, highly significant genetic differentiation was detected based on loci that appeared to be under selection. BLAST2GO annotations of the outlier SNPs yielded hits for 61 (72%) of 85 significant BLASTX matches. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis identified some of the putative targets of local selection, including genes in several important pathways such as calcium signaling pathway and intestinal immune network for IgA production.

How these groups thrive in the diverse physicochemical environments of different oceanic regions remains poorly understood. Comparative metagenomics can reveal adaptive responses linked to ecosystem-specific selective pressures. The Red Sea is well-suited for studying adaptation of pelagic-microbes, with salinities, temperatures, and light levels at the extreme end for the surface ocean, and low nutrient concentrations, yet no metagenomic studies have been done there. The Red Sea (high salinity, high light, low N and P) compares favorably with the Mediterranean Sea (high salinity, low P), Sargasso Sea (low P), and North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (high light, low N). We quantified the relative abundance of genetic functions among Prochlorococcus, cyanophage, and SAR11 from these four regions. Gene frequencies indicate selection for phosphorus acquisition (Mediterranean/Sargasso), DNA repair and high-light responses (Red Sea/Pacific Prochlorococcus), and osmolyte C1 oxidation (Red Sea/Mediterranean SAR11). The unexpected connection between salinity-dependent osmolyte production and SAR11 C1 metabolism represents a potentially major coevolutionary adaptation and biogeochemical flux. Among Prochlorococcus and cyanophage, genes enriched in specific environments had ecotype distributions similar to nonenriched genes, suggesting that inter-ecotype gene transfer is not a major source of environment-specific adaptation. Clustering of metagenomes using gene frequencies shows similarities in populations (Red Sea with Pacific, Mediterranean with Sargasso) that belie their geographic distances. Taken together, the genetic functions enriched in specific environments indicate competitive strategies for maintaining carrying capacity in the face of physical stressors and low nutrient availability.",2013,"cyanophage; metagenomics; osmolyte; pelagibacter; population genomics; prochlorococcus; sar11","Article","ISI"

We first show that populations are adapted to local salinity in a key reproductive trait, the proportion of motile sperm. Thereafter, we show that genome variation at 22,190 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) shows strong differentiation among populations along the gradient. Sequences containing outlier SNPs and transcriptome sequences, mapped to a draft genome, reveal associations with genes with relevant functions for adaptation in this environment but without overall evidence of functional enrichment. The many contigs involved suggest polygenic differentiation.

The adaptive basis of this geographical variation in body size is explained mostly by the heat conservation hypothesis. Application of Bergmann's rule has been confirmed mostly among terrestrial taxa and studies of marine taxa are rare. Our aim was to examine whether the intra-specific variation in body size of a pelagic seabird species (streaked shearwater Calonectris leucomelas) follows Bergmann's/James's rule. LocationEight different breeding colonies of the streaked shearwater, ranging from 24-39 degrees N in latitude (approximately the full latitudinal range of the species) and 123-142 degrees E in longitude. MethodsWe measured morphological traits of 454 adult streaked shearwaters in total. Principal components analysis was used to create a composite body size index for each sex from each colony using the measured traits, and the value of first principal component was compared. The relationships between body size index and latitude, longitude and the averaged mean air temperature were examined using generalized linear models. ResultsBody size was positively correlated with latitude and longitude, and negatively correlated with the mean air temperature. Latitude and longitude were highly correlated with air temperature. Nonetheless, between colonies, populations that are considered to forage over large areas appeared to exhibit smaller body size than those of lower latitude populations. Main conclusionThe overall trend of the geographical variations in body size of streaked shearwaters followed Bergmann's/James's rule, suggesting that this rule may be applicable to seabirds.

In this study, we revealed distinct genetic variation in Crassostrea ariakensis by comparing the COI gene segment sequence in northern and southern oysters partitioned by the Yangtze River estuary. Reciprocal hybridization and intrapopulation crosses clarified their taxonomic status as the same species. There was no heterosis in the survival and growth of the hybrids, while the maternal effect was observed in larvae from eggs in the native habitat that showed higher fitness. Both the northern and southern F-1 progenies exhibited positive performance in fitness traits, including survivorship, respiration rate, and growth, in their native habitats compared to that in their non-native habitats, indicating a strong signature of local adaptation. The oysters dwelling in the warm/southern habitats evolved a higher thermotolerance of LT50, while the oysters inhabiting the high-salinity/northern habitats had a 2.43 parts per thousand higher LS50 than that of their southern counterparts. After strong natural selection in the northern environments, the higher survival of the F-1 progenies from the southern oysters under heat shock indicates an evolved genetic basis for its higher thermal tolerance.

We conducted common garden experiments on the Atlantic silverside, Menidia menidia, from 39 locations along its 3 000 km range thereby mapping genetic variation for growth rate, vertebral number and sex determination. Each trait displayed unique clinal patterns, with significant differences (adaptive or not) occurring over very small distances. Breakpoints in the cline differed among traits, corresponding only partially with presumed eco-geographical boundaries. Because clinal patterns are unique to each selected character, neutral genes or those coding for a single character cannot serve as proxies for the genetic structure as a whole.

It is one of the most environmentally impacted brackish seas worldwide, and the low biodiversity makes it particularly sensitive to anthropogenic pressures including climate change. We applied a novel combination of models to predict the fate of one of the dominant foundation species in the Baltic Sea, the bladder wrack Fucus vesiculosus. Location: The Baltic Sea. Methods: We used a species distribution model to predict climate change-induced displacement of F.vesiculosus and combined these projections with a biophysical model of dispersal and connectivity to explore whether the dispersal rate of locally adapted genotypes may match estimated climate velocities to recolonize the receding salinity gradient. In addition, we used a population dynamic model to assess possible effects of habitat fragmentation. Results: The species distribution model showed that the habitat of F.vesiculosus is expected to dramatically shrink, mainly caused by the predicted reduction of salinity. In addition, the dispersal rate of locally adapted genotypes may not keep pace with estimated climate velocities rendering the recolonization of the receding salinity gradient more difficult. A simplistic model of population dynamics also indicated that the risk of local extinction may increase due to future habitat fragmentation. Main conclusions: Results point to a significant risk of locally adapted genotypes being unable to shift their ranges sufficiently fast considering the restricted dispersal and long generation time. The worst scenario is that F.vesiculosus may disappear from large parts of the Baltic Sea before the end of this century with large effects on the biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. We finally discuss how to reduce this risk through conservation actions, including assisted colonization and assisted evolution.",2018,"baltic sea; bladder wrack; climate change; connectivity; dispersal; fragmentation; local adaptation; range shift; salinity; species distribution model","Article","ISI"

Experimental populations from four locations representing between 75 and 99% of each species thermal distribution and a 6 degrees C gradient in summer temperatures, were exposed to 10 temperature treatments between 15 and 36 degrees C. Experimental thermal performance displayed the greatest variability between species, with optimal temperatures differing by over 10 degrees C within the same location. Within-species differences in thermal performance were also important for P. oceanica which displayed large thermal safety margins within cool and warm-edge populations and small safety margins within central populations.

We examined the genetic response to OA of larvae of the tropical sea urchin Echinometra sp. C. raised on coral reefs that were either influenced by CO2 vents (pH 7.9, future OA condition) or nonvent control reefs (pH 8.2).

We tested for outlier SNPs and functional enrichment in embryos and larvae raised from adults from the control or vent sites. Generally, highest F-ST values in embryos were observed between sites (intrinsic adaptation, most representative of the gene pool in the spawned populations). This comparison also had the highest number of outlier loci (40). In the other comparisons, classical adaptation (comparing larvae with adults from the control transplanted to either the control or vent conditions) and reverse adaptation (larvae from the vent site returned to the vent or explanted at the control), we only observed modest numbers of outlier SNPs (6-19) and only enrichment in two functional pathways.

"Evidence of rapid adaptive trait change to local salinity in the sperm of an invasive fish","10.1111/eva.12859","Green, L; Havenhand, JN; Kvarnemo, C","Invasive species may quickly colonize novel environments, which could be attributed to both phenotypic plasticity and an ability to locally adapt. Reproductive traits are expected to be under strong selection when the new environment limits reproductive success of the invading species. This may be especially important for external fertilizers, which release sperm and eggs into the new environment. Despite adult tolerance to high salinity, the invasive fish Neogobius melanostomus (round goby) is absent from fully marine regions of the Baltic Sea, raising the possibility that its distribution is limited by tolerance during earlier life stages. Here, we investigate the hypothesis that the spread of N. melanostomus is limited by sperm function in novel salinities. We sampled sperm from two invasion fronts with higher and lower salinities in the Baltic Sea and tested them across a range of salinity levels. We found that sperm velocity and percentage of motile sperm declined in salinity levels higher and lower than those currently experienced by the Baltic Sea populations, with different performance curves for the two fronts. Sperm velocity also peaked closer to the home salinity conditions in each respective invasion front, with older localities showing an increased fit to local conditions. By calculating how the sperm velocity has changed over generations, we show this phenotypic shift to be in the range of other fish species under strong selection, indicating ongoing local adaptation or epigenetic acclimation to their novel environment. These results show that while immigrant reproductive dysfunction appears to at least partly limit the distribution of invasive N. melanostomus in the Baltic Sea, local adaptation to novel environments could enable future spread beyond their current boundaries.",2020,"baltic sea; immigrant reproductive dysfunction; invasion biology; local adaptation; neogobius melanostomus; salinity; spermatozoa","Article","ISI"

Contrary to this assumption, however, genetic differentiation is often observed in marine invertebrates. In the present study, we sought to explain how population structure is established in the western Pacific Ocean, where the strong Kuroshio Current maintains high levels of gene flow from south to north, presumably promoting genetic homogeneity. We determined the population structure of the pearl oyster, Pinctada fucata, in the Indo-Pacific Ocean using genome-wide genotyping data from multiple sampling localities. Cluster analysis showed that the western Pacific population is distinct from that of the Indian Ocean, and that it is divided into northern (Japanese mainland) and southern (Nansei Islands, China, and Cambodia) populations. Genetic differentiation of P. fucata can be explained by geographic barriers in the Indian Ocean and a local lagoon, and by environmental gradients of sea surface temperature (SST) and oxygen concentration in the western Pacific. A genome scan showed evidence of adaptive evolution in genomic loci, possibly associated with changes in environmental factors, including SST and oxygen concentration. Furthermore, Bayesian simulation demonstrated that the past population expansion and division are congruent with ocean warming after the last glacial period. It is highly likely that the environmental gradient forms a genetic barrier that diversifies P. fucata populations in the western Pacific.

Results indicated a clear distinctness of the Kiel Bight from the populations of the eastern Baltic. F-ST comparison between both eastern samples was non-significant.

In natural populations, the direction and magnitude of these processes can be variable across different spatial, temporal, or ontogenetic scales. Consequently, variability in evolutionary processes affects the predictability or stochasticity of microevolutionary outcomes. We studied an intertidal fish, Bathygobius cocosensis (Bleeker, 1854), to understand how space, time, and life stage structure genetic and phenotypic variation in a species with potentially extensive dispersal and a complex life cycle (larval dispersal preceding benthic recruitment). We sampled juvenile and adult life stages, at three sites, over three years. Genome-wide SNPs uncovered a pattern of chaotic genetic patchiness, that is, weak-but-significant patchy spatial genetic structure that was variable through time and between life stages. Outlier locus analyses suggested that targets of spatially divergent selection were mostly temporally variable, though a significant number of spatial outlier loci were shared between life stages. Head shape, a putatively ecologically responsive (adaptive) phenotype in B. cocosensis also exhibited high temporal variability within sites. However, consistent spatial relationships between sites indicated that environmental similarities among sites may generate predictable phenotype distributions across space. Our study highlights the complex microevolutionary dynamics of marine systems, where consideration of multiple ecological dimensions can reveal both predictable and stochastic patterns in the distributions of genetic and phenotypic variation. Such considerations probably apply to species that possess short, complex life cycles, have large dispersal potential and fecundities, and that inhabit heterogeneous environments.",2021,"chaotic genetic patchiness; complex life cycles; geometric morphometrics; marine organisms; population genomics; spatiotemporal variation","Article","ISI"

Genotyping with mapped transcriptome-derived markers and advanced seascape statistical analyses are proven tools to uncover the genomic basis of biologically relevant traits under environmental selection. Using a panel of 426 gene-linked single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we scanned 17 samples (n = 539) of sole (Solea solea L.) from the Northeast Atlantic Ocean and applied a node-based seascape analysis. Neutral loci confirmed a clear distinction between the North Sea-Baltic Sea transition zone and the other Eastern Atlantic samples. At a more subtle level, the latter unit split in an English Channel and North Sea group, and a Bay of Biscay and Atlantic Iberian coast group. A fourth group, the Irish and Celtic Sea, was identified with 19 outlier loci. A pattern of isolation by distance (IBD) characterized the latitudinal distribution. Seascape analyses identified winter seawater temperature, food availability and coastal currents to explain a significant component of geographically distributed genetic variation, suggesting that these factors act as drivers of local adaptation. The evidence for local adaptation is in line with the current understanding on the impact of two key ecological factors, the life-history trait winter mortality and the behaviour of inshore/off-shore spawning. We conclude that the subtle differentiation between two metapopulations (North Sea and Bay of Biscay) mirrors local adaptation.

This presents a challenge to define management units. Goldsinny wrasse (Ctenolabrus rupestris) is a heavily exploited species due to its importance as a cleaner-fish in commercial salmonid aquaculture. However, at the present, the population genetic structure of this species is still largely unresolved. Here, full-genome sequencing was used to produce the first genomic reference for this species, to study population-genomic divergence among four geographically distinct populations, and, to identify informative SNP markers for future studies. Results: After construction of a de novo assembly, the genome was estimated to be highly polymorphic and of similar to 600Mbp in size. 33,235 SNPs were thereafter selected to assess genomic diversity and differentiation among four populations collected from Scandinavia, Scotland, and Spain. GlobalF(ST)among these populations was 0.015-0.092. Approximately 4% of the investigated loci were identified as putative global outliers, and similar to 1% within Scandinavia. SNPs showing large divergence (F-ST > 0.15) were picked as candidate diagnostic markers for population assignment. One hundred seventy-three of the most diagnostic SNPs between the two Scandinavian populations were validated by genotyping 47 individuals from each end of the species' Scandinavian distribution range. Sixty-nine of these SNPs were significantly (p < 0.05) differentiated (meanF(ST_173_loci) = 0.065, F-ST_69_loci = 0.140). Using these validated SNPs, individuals were assigned with high probability (>= 94%) to their populations of origin. Conclusions: Goldsinny wrasse displays a highly polymorphic genome, and substantial population genomic structure. Diversifying selection likely affects population structuring globally and within Scandinavia. The diagnostic loci identified now provide a promising and cost-efficient tool to investigate goldsinny wrasse populations further.",2020,"assignment; ctenolabrus rupestris; marker validation; population genomics; resequencing; snp","Article","ISI"
"Familial social structure and socially driven genetic differentiation in Hawaiian short-finned pilot whales","10.1111/mec.14397","Van Cise, AM; Martien, KK; Mahaffy, SD; Baird, RW; Webster, DL; Fowler, JH; Oleson, EM; Morin, PA","Social structure can have a significant impact on divergence and evolution within species, especially in the marine environment, which has few environmental boundaries to dispersal. On the other hand, genetic structure can affect social structure in many species, through an individual preference towards associating with relatives. One social species, the short-finned pilot whale (Globicephala macrorhynchus), has been shown to live in stable social groups for periods of at least a decade. Using mitochondrial control sequences from 242 individuals and single nucleotide polymorphisms from 106 individuals, we examine population structure among geographic and social groups of short-finned pilot whales in the Hawaiian Islands, and test for links between social and genetic structure. Our results show that there are at least two geographic populations in the Hawaiian Islands: a Main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) population and a Northwestern Hawaiian Islands/Pelagic population (F-ST and phi(ST)p<.001), as well as an eastern MHI community and a western MHI community (F(ST)p=.009). We find genetically driven social structure, or high relatedness among social units and clusters (p<.001), and a positive relationship between relatedness and association between individuals (p<.0001). Further, socially organized clusters are genetically distinct, indicating that social structure drives genetic divergence within the population, likely through restricted mate selection (F(ST)p=.05). This genetic divergence among social groups can make the species less resilient to anthropogenic or ecological disturbance. Conservation of this species therefore depends on understanding links among social structure, genetic structure and ecological variability within the species.",2017,"cetacean; divergence; gene-culture co-evolution; genomics; globicephala macrorhynchus; population structure; relatedness","Article","ISI"
"Phenotype-environment mismatches reduce connectivity in the sea","10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01408.x","Marshall, DJ; Monro, K; Bode, M; Keough, MJ; Swearer, S","The connectivity of marine populations is often surprisingly lower than predicted by the dispersal capabilities of propagules alone. Estimates of connectivity, moreover, do not always scale with distance and are sometimes counterintuitive. Population connectivity requires more than just the simple exchange of settlers among populations: it also requires the successful establishment and reproduction of exogenous colonizers. Marine organisms often disperse over large spatial scales, encountering very different environments and suffering extremely high levels of post-colonization mortality. Given the growing evidence that such selection pressures often vary over spatial scales that are much smaller than those of dispersal, we argue that selection will bias survival against exogenous colonizers. We call this selection against exogenous colonizers a phenotype-environment mismatch and argue that phenotype-environment mismatches represent an important barrier to connectivity in the sea. Crucially, these mismatches may operate independently of distance and thereby have the potential to explain the counterintuitive patterns of connectivity often seen in marine environments. We discuss how such mismatches might alter our understanding and management of marine populations.

"The evolutionary history of the embiotocid surfperch radiation based on genome-wide RAD sequence data","10.1016/j.ympev.2015.03.027","Longo, G; Bernardi, G","The radiation of surfperches (Embiotocidae) in the temperate North Pacific has been suggested to be the product of ecological competition and niche partitioning. Surfperches are a family of viviparous marine fishes, which have been used to study multiple paternity, sperm competition, and population genetics. Phylogenetic inference is essential for interpreting the evolutionary context of embiotocid life history traits and testing alternative scenarios, yet previous studies have yielded phylogenies with low support and incongruent topologies. Here we constructed reduced representation genomic libraries using restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) sequence markers to infer phylogenetic relationships among all genera and 22 out of 24 embiotocid species. Orthologous markers retained across 91% of sampled species, corresponding to 523 loci, yielded trees with the highest support values. Our results support a scenario where embiotocids first diverged into clades associated with sandy and reef habitats during the middle Miocene (13-18 Mya) with subsequent invasions of novel habitats in the reef associated clade, and northern range expansion in the Northwest Pacific. The appearance of California kelp forests (Laminariales) in the late Miocene (8-15 Mya) correlates with further proliferation in the reef associated clade. In all cases, radiations occurred within specific habitats, a pattern consistent with niche partitioning. We infer fine scale species relationships among surfperches with confidence and corroborate the utility of RAD data for phylogenetic inference in young lineages. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

"Geographic variation in feeding preference of a generalist herbivore: the importance of seaweed chemical defenses","10.1007/s00442-012-2559-6","McCarty, AT; Sotka, EE","The ecological impacts of generalist herbivores depend on feeding preferences, which can vary across and within herbivore species. Among mesoherbivores, geographic variation in host use can occur because host plants have a more restricted geographic distribution than does the herbivore, or there is local evolution in host preference, or both. We tested the role of local evolution using the marine amphipod Ampithoe longimana by rearing multiple amphipod populations from three regions (subtropical Florida, warm-temperate North Carolina and cold-temperate New England) and assaying their feeding preferences toward ten seaweeds that occur in some but not all regions. Six of the ten seaweeds produce anti-herbivore secondary metabolites, and we detected geographic variation in feeding preference toward five (Dictyota menstrualis, Dictyota ciliolata, Fucus distichus, Chondrus crispus and Padina gymnospora, but not Caulerpa sertularioides). Amphipod populations that co-occur with a chemically-rich seaweed tended to have stronger feeding preferences for that seaweed, relative to populations that do not co-occur with the seaweed. A direct test indicated that geographic variation in feeding preference toward one seaweed (D. ciliolata) is mediated by feeding tolerance for lipophilic secondary metabolites. Among the four seaweeds that produce no known secondary metabolites (Acanthophora, Ectocarpus, Gracilaria and Hincksia/Feldmannia spp.), we detected no geographic variation in feeding preference. Thus, populations are more likely to evolve greater feeding preferences for local hosts when those hosts produce secondary metabolites. Microevolution of feeding behaviors of generalist marine consumers likely depends on the availability and identity of local hosts and the strength of their chemical defenses.",2013,"local adaptation; feeding preference; plant chemical defenses; herbivore offense; ampithoidae; phylogeography","Article","ISI"
"Morpho-Genetic Divergence and Adaptation of Anadromous Hilsa shad (Tenualosa ilisha) Along Their Heterogenic Migratory Habitats","10.3389/fmars.2020.00554","Asaduzzaman, M; Wahab, MA; Rahman, MM; Mariom; Nahiduzzaman, M; Rahman, MJ; Roy, BK; Phillips, MJ; Wong, L","Migration of an anadromous fish to heterogeneous environment continuously enforces a selective pressure that incorporates a wide range of life-history strategies by which individuals adapt to the prevailing conditions. Therefore, we used the landmark-based morphometric truss network method and nextRAD genotyping-based putatively adaptive SNP loci dataset to know how the anadromous Hilsa shad (Tenualosa ilisha) morpho-genetically adapt to the heterogeneous habitats across their migratory routes by investigating 300 individuals, collected from nine strategic sampling sites covering sea, estuary, and upstream freshwater rivers. Different multivariate and clustering analyses revealed that the riverine populations were morphometrically wider (broad type) than the estuarine and marine populations (slender type). In the case of riverine population, the north-western turbid population (the Padma and Jamuna rivers) had wider body depth than the north-eastern clear water population (the Meghna river). The linear model and spatial multivariate analyses further revealed that the outcomes of morphometric dataset were in complete concordance with the results of putatively adaptive SNP loci dataset for different Hilsa shad populations. The gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways enrichment analysis of the 36 genes, which are encoded by the putative adaptive SNP loci, supported the presence of multiple genes involved in the growth, metabolism, homeostasis and osmoregulation related functions. Several non-mutually exclusive hypotheses were attributed to explain the observation of continuum differentiation at both phenotypes and genotypes: (i) the genetic variation largely determines the morphometric discrimination, (ii) the interactive evolutionary processes and salinity predominantly contribute to the morphogenetic difference between the marine-estuarine and the freshwater riverine populations, (iii) environmental heterogeneity largely influences the genotypes leading to the phenotypic plasticity, and (iv) the local environmental heterogeneity may contribute to the morphogenetic divergence between the riverine populations. Finally, we concluded that the genetic adaptation, phenotypic plasticity and interactive ecological and evolutionary consequences jointly determine the morphogenetic divergence of Hilsa shad. The interaction of all of these forces and their relative strength in heterogeneous environments, however, made it rather challenging to determine the most probable selective pressure, which has shaped the Hilsa shad morphogenetic divergence across their diverse migratory habitats.",2020,"hilsa shad (tenualosa ilisha); anadromous fish; morphogenetic divergence; environmental heterogeneity; nextrad genotyping; local adaptation","Article","ISI"
"Divergence in chick developmental patterns among wedge-tailed shearwater populations","10.3354/meps10322","McDuie, F; Goulding, W; Peck, DR; Congdon, BC","Mechanisms of population divergence in seabirds are poorly understood. We evaluated whether divergent patterns of chick development among wedge-tailed shearwater Puffinus pacificus populations are facultative responses to short-term fluctuations in food availability, or fixed colony-specific phenomena potentially associated with differences in local resource availability. Supplementary feeding at Heron Island increased food intake to levels equal to, or greater than, those observed at Lord Howe Island. In supplemented chicks, mass accumulation per gram of food received was inversely related to current body stores, up to a maximum storage level set by body size. Significantly, maximum storage was lower for Heron Island than for Lord Howe Island chicks at equivalent body size. In contrast, relative allocation to skeletal growth did not differ between supplemented and control chicks, was not influenced by body condition and did not increase to levels observed at Lord Howe Island. Overall, the present study showed that supplemented chicks were unable to use short-term increases in food availability to increase relative mass stores or rates of skeletal development, implying that both life-history parameters have some colony-specific components that are divergent between the locations of this study. Our findings add weight to previous studies suggesting that phenotypic plasticity and/or genetic drift due to philopatry cannot fully explain patterns of morphological, behavioural and physiological divergence among these 2 shearwater colonies.",2013,"colony-specific development; chick growth; local adaptation; puffinus pacificus; supplementary feeding","Article","ISI"

We capitalized on a major prehistoric (800 yr BP) geological uplift event affecting a southern New Zealand coastline to test for the lasting genomic impacts of disturbance. Genome-wide analyses of three co-distributed keystone kelp taxa revealed that post-earthquake recolonization drove the evolution of novel, large-scale intertidal spatial genetic 'sectors' which are tightly linked to geological fault boundaries. Demographic simulations confirmed that, following widespread extirpation, parallel expansions into newly vacant habitats rapidly restructured genome-wide diversity. Interspecific differences in recolonization mode and tempo reflect differing ecological constraints relating to habitat choice and dispersal capacity among taxa.

"Adaptation and the physiology of ocean acidification","10.1111/j.1365-2435.2012.02061.x","Kelly, MW; Hofmann, GE","1. Ocean acidification, caused by the uptake of atmospheric CO2, is a threat to marine bio-diversity, potentially rivalling the threat imposed by rising temperatures in some marine ecosystems. Although a growing body of literature documents negative effects of acidification on marine organisms, the majority of this work has focused on the effects of future conditions on modern populations, ignoring the potential effects of adaptation and physiological acclimatization. 2. We review current literature on the potential for adaptation to elevated pCO(2) in marine organisms. Although this body of work is currently quite small, we argue that data on the physiological effects of acidification, natural variation in pH and lessons learned from previous work on thermal adaptation can all inform predictions and priorities for future research. 3. Spatially varying selection is one of the most important forces maintaining intraspecific genetic variation. Unlike temperature, pH lacks a strong and persistent global gradient, and so selection may maintain less adaptive variation for pH than for temperature. On the other hand, we are only beginning to amass long-term data sets for pH variation in natural habitats, and thus, pH gradients may be more common than previously observed. 4. Two of the most important effects of elevated pCO(2) are reduced calcification and changes in metabolism. We discuss the ways that a detailed understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying these effects is key to predicting the capacity for acclimatization and adaptation. 5. Important priorities for future research will be to assess local adaptation to pH conditions and to measure the capacity for adaptation to future acidified conditions in natural populations. Tools for this work include traditional quantitative genetics, transcriptomics and the adaptation of ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET) technology for use in continuous sea-water pH monitoring in the field.",2013,"acclimation; calcification; climate change; contemporary evolution; ion-sensitive field-effect transistor; local adaptation; ocean acidifcation","Article","ISI"
"Biogeographic and phylogenetic effects on feeding resistance of generalist herbivores toward plant chemical defenses","10.1890/11-0873.1","Craft, JD; Paul, VJ; Sotka, EE","Many terrestrial and most marine herbivores have generalist diets, yet the role that evolutionary history plays in their foraging behaviors is poorly documented. On tropical hard-bottom reefs, generalist fishes and sea urchins readily consume seaweeds that produce lipophilic secondary metabolites. In contrast, herbivores on temperate reefs less commonly encounter seaweeds with analogous metabolites. This biogeographic pattern suggests that tropical herbivores should evolve greater feeding resistance to lipophilic defenses relative to temperate herbivores, but tests of this biogeographic pattern are rare. We offered lipophilic extracts from nine subtropical seaweeds at two concentrations to sea urchins (four subtropical and three cold-temperate populations) and quantified urchin feeding resistance. Patterns of feeding resistance toward lipophilic defenses were more similar within genera than across genera of urchins, indicating a substantial role for phylogenetic history in the feeding ecology of these generalist herbivores. The biogeographic origin of urchins also influenced feeding resistance, as subtropical species displayed greater feeding resistance than did temperate species. Similarly, a subtropical population of Arbacia punctulata had greater feeding resistance for Dictyota and Stypopodium extracts relative to temperate A. punctulata. We conclude that evolutionary history plays a more central role in the foraging ecology of generalist herbivores than is currently appreciated.",2013,"arms race; generalist herbivore; herbivore feeding preference; latitudinal patterns of biotic interaction; lipophilic compounds; local adaptation; sea urchins; secondary metabolites; tropical vs. temperate herbivory","Article","ISI"

Genetic fingerprinting is important for both certifying authenticity and traceability of fish species. In this study, we developed a method that combines DNA barcoding and restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-Seq) approach for the identification of cod products. Two sequences that contain single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)s were identified and these SNPs can be used to distinguish three different cod species, which are Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), Greenland turbot (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), and Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides). This SNP-based method will help us to identify the products, which are sold under the name of Xue Yu (Cod) in China, and works in parallel with existing fish identification techniques to establish an efficient framework to detect and prevent fraud at all points of the cod commercialization. Abstract The increase in the rate of seafood fraud, particularly in the expensive fishes, forces us to verify the identity of marine products. Meanwhile, the definition of cod lacks consistency at the international level, as few standards and effective application methods are capable of accurately detecting cod species. Genetic fingerprinting is important for both certifying authenticity and traceability of fish species. In this study, we developed a method that combines DNA barcoding and the restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-Seq) approach for the identification of cod products.

As the ecologically and commercially important small-sized shallow-sea fish, Collichthys lucidus plays a vital role in the structure and functioning of marine ecosystem processes. C. lucidus has been shown to have an obvious population structure. Therefore, it is an ideal candidate for investigating population differentiation and local adaptation under heterogeneous environmental pressure. Results A total of 184,708 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified and applied to elucidate the fine-scale genetic structure and local thermal adaptation of 8 C. lucidus populations. Population structure analysis based on all SNPs indicated that the northern group and southern group of C. lucidus have a strong differentiation. Moreover, 314 SNPs were found to be significantly associated with temperature variation, and annotations of genes containing temperature-related SNPs suggested that genes were involved in material (protein, lipid, and carbohydrate) metabolism and immune responses. Conclusion The high genetic differentiation of 8 C. lucidus populations may have been caused by long-term geographic isolation during the glacial period. Moreover, we suspected that variation in these genes associated with material (protein, lipid, and carbohydrate) metabolism and immune responses was critical for adaptation to spatially heterogeneous temperatures in natural C. lucidus populations. In conclusion, this study could help us determine how C. lucidus populations will respond to future ocean temperature rising.",2021,"collichthys lucidus; genetic diversity; population structure; local adaptive; population genomics","Article","ISI"
"Ancient genomic variation underlies repeated ecological adaptation in young stickleback populations","10.1002/evl3.37","Nelsonl, TC; Cresko, WA","Adaptation in the wild often involves standing genetic variation (SGV), which allows rapid responses to selection on ecological timescales. However, we still know little about how the evolutionary histories and genomic distributions of SGV influence local adaptation in natural populations. Here, we address this knowledge gap using the threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) as a model. We extend restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) to produce phased haplotypes approaching 700 base pairs (bp) in length at each of over 50,000 loci across the stickleback genome. Parallel adaptation in two geographically isolated freshwater pond populations consistently involved fixation of haplotypes that are identical-by-descent. In these same genomic regions, sequence divergence between marine and freshwater stickleback, as measured by d(XY), reaches tenfold higher than background levels and genomic variation is structured into distinct marine and freshwater haplogroups. By combining this dataset with a de novo genome assembly of a related species, the ninespine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius), we find that this habitat-associated divergent variation averages six million years old, nearly twice the genome-wide average. The genomic variation that is involved in recent and rapid local adaptation in stickleback has therefore been evolving throughout the 15-million-year history since the two species lineages split. This long history of genomic divergence has maintained large genomic regions of ancient ancestry that include multiple chromosomal inversions and extensive linked variation. These discoveries of ancient genetic variation spread broadly across the genome in stickleback demonstrate how selection on ecological timescales is a result of genome evolution over geological timescales, and vice versa.",2018,"adaptation; evolutionary genomics; speciation islands; rad-seq","Article","ISI"

However, detection of selected loci can be difficult when populations are weakly differentiated. This is the case of marine fish populations, often characterized by high levels of gene flow and connectivity, and particularly of fish living in the Antarctic marine environment, characterized by a complex and strong circulating system promoting individual dispersal all around the continent. With the final aim of identifying outlier loci putatively under selection in the Chionodraco genus, we used 21 microsatellites, including both genomic (Type II) and EST-linked loci (Type I), to investigate the genetic differentiation among the three recently derived Chionodraco species that are endemic to the freezing Antarctic waters. Neutrality tests were applied in interspecific comparisons in order to identify candidate loci showing high levels of genetic differentiation, which might reveal imprints of past selection. Three outlier loci were identified, detecting a higher differentiation between species than did neutral loci. Outliers showed sequence similarity to a calmodulin gene, to an antifreeze glycoprotein/trypsinogen-like protease gene and to nonannotated fish mRNAs. Selective pressures acting on outlier loci identified in this study might reflect past evolutionary processes, which led to species divergence and local adaptation in the Chionodraco genus.

RADassembler integrates the algorithms for choosing the optimal number of mismatches within and across individuals at the clustering stage, and then uses a two-step assembly approach at the assembly stage. RADassembler also uses data reduction and parallelization strategies to promote efficiency. Compared to other tools, both the assembly results based on simulation and real RAD datasets demonstrated that RADassembler could always assemble the appropriate number of contigs with high qualities, and more read pairs were properly mapped to the assembled contigs.

Southern Gulf of St. Lawrence cod larvae experienced faster growth in warmer water and low, uniform survival across all experimental temperatures (3, 7, 11 degrees C), consistent with previous studies on this spring-spawning population. In contrast, larvae from fall-spawning Southwestern Scotian Shelf cod collected near Sambro, Nova Scotia, lacked plasticity for growth but experienced much lower survival at higher temperatures. Phenotypes that are positively associated with fitness were observed at temperatures closest to those experienced in the wild, consistent with the hypothesis that these populations are adapted to local thermal regimes. The lack of growth plasticity observed in Sambro cod might be due to costly maintenance of plasticity in stable environments or energy savings at cold temperatures.

"Transcriptomic responses to seawater acidification among sea urchin populations inhabiting a natural pH mosaic","10.1111/mec.14038","Evans, TG; Pespeni, MH; Hofmann, GE; Palumbi, SR; Sanford, E","Increasing awareness of spatial and temporal variation in ocean pH suggests some marine populations may be adapted to local pH regimes and will therefore respond differently to present-day pH variation and to long-term ocean acidification. In the Northeast Pacific Ocean, differences in the strength of coastal upwelling cause latitudinal variation in prevailing pH regimes that are hypothesized to promote local adaptation and unequal pH tolerance among resident populations. In this study, responses to experimental seawater acidification were compared among embryos and larvae from six populations of purple sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) inhabiting areas that differ in their frequency of low pH exposure and that prior research suggests are locally adapted to seawater pH. Transcriptomic analyses demonstrate urchin populations most frequently exposed to low pH seawater responded to experimental acidification by expressing genes within major ATP-producing pathways at greater levels than populations encountering low pH less often. Multiple genes within the tricarboxylic acid cycle, electron transport chain and fatty acid beta oxidation pathways were upregulated in urchin populations experiencing low pH conditions most frequently. These same metabolic pathways were significantly over-represented among genes both expressed in a population-specific manner and putatively under selection to enhance low pH tolerance. Collectively, these data suggest natural selection is acting on metabolic gene networks to redirect ATP toward maintaining acid-base homeostasis and enhance tolerance of seawater acidification. As a trade-off, marine populations more tolerant of low pH may have less energy to put towards other aspects of fitness and to respond to additional ocean change.",2017,"climate change; genomics; ocean acidification; population; transcriptomics; urchin","Article","ISI"

Production of monosex female stocks is desirable in commercial production since females grow faster and mature later than males. Understanding the sex determination mechanism and developing sex-associated markers will shorten the time for the development of monosex female production, thus decreasing the costs of farming. Results: Halibut juveniles were masculinised with 17 alpha-methyldihydrotestosterone (MDHT) and grown to maturity. Progeny groups from four treated males were reared and sexed. Two of these groups (n = 26 and 70) consisted of only females, while the other two (n = 30 and 71) contained balanced sex ratios (50% and 48% females respectively). DNA from parents and offspring from the two mixed-sex families were used as a template for Restriction-site Associated DNA (RAD) sequencing. The 648 million raw reads produced 90,105 unique RAD-tags. A linkage map was constructed based on 5703 Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) markers and 7 microsatellites consisting of 24 linkage groups, which corresponds to the number of chromosome pairs in this species. A major sex determining locus was mapped to linkage group 13 in both families. Assays for 10 SNPs with significant association with phenotypic sex were tested in both population data and in 3 additional families. Using a variety of machine-learning algorithms 97% correct classification could be obtained with the 3% of errors being phenotypic males predicted to be females. Conclusion: Altogether our findings support the hypothesis that the Atlantic halibut has an XX/XY sex determination system. Assays are described for sex-associated DNA markers developed from the RAD sequencing analysis to fast track progeny testing and implement monosex female halibut production for an immediate improvement in productivity. These should also help to speed up the inclusion of neomales derived from many families to maintain a larger effective population size and ensure long-term improvement through selective breeding.",2013,"hippoglossus hippoglossus; sex determination; monosex; qtl mapping; rad-seq; aquaculture","Article","ISI"

The Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida), patchily distributed from Baja California to the central coast of Canada, has a long history of population declines due to anthropogenic stressors. For such coastal marine species, population structure could follow a continuous isolation-by-distance model, contain regional blocks of genetic similarity separated by barriers to gene flow, or be consistent with a null model of no population structure. To distinguish between these hypotheses in O. lurida, 13,424 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were used to characterize rangewide population structure, genetic connectivity, and adaptive divergence. Samples were collected across the species range on the west coast of North America, from southern California to Vancouver Island. A conservative approach for detecting putative loci under selection identified 235 SNPs across 129 GBS loci, which were functionally annotated and analyzed separately from the remaining neutral loci. While strong population structure was observed on a regional scale in both neutral and outlier markers, neutral markers had greater power to detect fine-scale structure. Geographic regions of reduced gene flow aligned with known marine biogeographic barriers, such as Cape Mendocino, Monterey Bay, and the currents around Cape Flattery. The outlier loci identified as under putative selection included genes involved in developmental regulation, sensory information processing, energy metabolism, immune response, and muscle contraction. These loci are excellent candidates for future research and may provide targets for genetic monitoring programs. Beyond specific applications for restoration and management of the Olympia oyster, this study lends to the growing body of evidence for both population structure and adaptive differentiation across a range of marine species exhibiting the potential for panmixia. Computational notebooks are available to facilitate reproducibility and future open-sourced research on the population structure of O. lurida.",2019,"connectivity; genotype-by-sequencing; management recommendations; olympia oyster; outlier loci; population genomics","Article","ISI"

Here, we sequence restriction site-associated DNA to characterize genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a broadly distributed and highly migratory large pelagic fish, striped marlin (Kajikia audax). Assessment of over 4,000 SNPs resolved spatiotemporal patterns of genetic connectivity throughout the species range in the Pacific and, for the first time, Indian oceans. Individual-based cluster analyses identified six genetically distinct populations corresponding with the western Indian, eastern Indian, western South Pacific, and eastern central Pacific oceans, as well as two populations in the North Pacific Ocean (F-ST = 0.0137-0.0819). F-ST outlier analyses identified a subset of SNPs (n = 59) putatively under the influence of natural selection and capable of resolving populations separated by comparatively high degrees of genetic differentiation. Temporal collections available for some regions demonstrated the stability of allele frequencies over three to five generations of striped marlin. Relative migration rates reflected lower levels of genetic connectivity between Indian Ocean populations (m(R) <= 0.37) compared with most populations in the Pacific Ocean (m(R) >= 0.57) and highlight the importance of the western South Pacific in facilitating gene flow between ocean basins. Collectively, our results provide novel insights into rangewide population structure for striped marlin and highlight substantial inconsistencies between genetically distinct populations and stocks currently recognized for fisheries management. More broadly, we demonstrate that species capable of longdistance dispersal in environments lacking obvious physical barriers to movement can display substantial population subdivision that persists over multiple generations and that may be facilitated by both neutral and adaptive processes. Importantly, surveys of genome-wide markers enable inference of population-level relationships using sample sizes practical for large pelagic fishes of conservation concern.",2020,"dart; genetic connectivity; highly migratory; large pelagic fish; population genomics; snps; striped marlin; temporal stability","Article","ISI"

However, it is largely unknown if the embryos of populations from different thermal regimes will respond differently to increased warming, potentially due to adaptations to natal environmental conditions. The effects of temperature on respiration rates and oxygen content of the intracapsular fluid were studied during the intracapsular development of Ocenebra erinaceus in two subtidal populations, one from the middle of their geographic distribution, the Solent, UK and another towards the southern portion: Arcachon, France. In this laboratory study, embryos were exposed to temperatures in the range of 14-20 degrees C. The encapsulation period for both populations was shorter at higher temperatures and intracapsular oxygen availability decreased as development progressed. However, the embryonic aerobic response differed between populations. Encapsulated embryos from the southern population (Arcachon) showed higher respiration rates and metabolic adjustment to elevated temper atures; however, encapsulated embryos from the Solent showed no metabolic adjustment, high capsular mortalities and limited acclimation to high temperatures. Our results suggest that aerobic response of encapsulated embryos is locally adapted to the temperature history of their natal environment and illustrates the importance of local environmental history in determining the fate of key life stages in response to a changing marine climate.",2020,"temperature; encapsulation; aerobic metabolism; local adaptation; oxygen consumption; intracapsular fluid","Article","ISI"

Phenotypically parallel wave-adapted and crab-adapted ecotypes that hybridize within the middle shore are replicated along the northwestern coast of Spain and have likely arisen from two separate glacial refugia. We tested whether greater geographic separation corresponding to reduced opportunity for contemporary or historical gene flow between parallel ecotypes resulted in less parallel genomic divergence. We sequenced double-digested restriction-associated DNA (ddRAD) libraries from individual snails from upper, mid, and low intertidal levels of three separate sites colonized from two separate refugia. Outlier analysis of 4256 SNP markers identified 34.4% sharing of divergent loci between two geographically close sites; however, these sites each shared only 9.9%-15.1% of their divergent loci with a third more-distant site. STRUCTURE analysis revealed that genotypes from only three of 166 phenotypically intermediate mid-shore individuals appeared to result from recent hybridization, suggesting that hybrids cannot be reliably identified using shell traits. Hierarchical AMOVA indicated that the primary source of genomic differentiation was geographic separation, but also revealed greater similarity of the same ecotype across the two geographically close sites than previously estimated with dominant markers. These results from a model system for ecological speciation suggest that genomic parallelism is affected by the opportunity for historical or contemporary gene flow between populations.",2018,"ecological speciation; genomics; local adaptation; marine snail; parallelism; rad sequencing","Article","ISI"

This pattern is presumably due to high propagule pressure and repeated introductions. The opposite pattern is reported in this study of the brown seaweed, Sargassum muticum, an emblematic species for circumglobal invasions. Albeit demonstrating polymorphism in the native range, microsatellites failed to detect any genetic variation over 1,269 individuals sampled from 46 locations over the Pacific-Atlantic introduction range. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) obtained from ddRAD sequencing revealed some genetic variation, but confirmed severe founder events in both the Pacific and Atlantic introduction ranges. Our study thus exemplifies the need for extreme caution in interpreting neutral genetic diversity as a proxy for invasive potential. Our results confirm a previously hypothesized transoceanic secondary introduction from NE Pacific to Europe. However, the SNP panel unexpectedly revealed two additional distinct genetic origins of introductions. Also, conversely to scenarios based on historical records, southern rather than northern NE Pacific populations could have seeded most of the European populations. Finally, the most recently introduced populations showed the lowest selfing rates, suggesting higher levels of recombination might be beneficial at the early stage of the introduction process (i.e., facilitating evolutionary novelties), whereas uniparental reproduction might be favored later in sustainably established populations (i.e., sustaining local adaptation).",2020,"biological invasion; non-native species; population genomics; rad sequencing; seaweed; selfing","Article","ISI"

Here, genomic regions of elevated divergence were observed on three chromosomes of the highly mobile fish Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) within geographically fine-scaled coastal areas. The genomic islands extended at least 5, 9.5, and 13 megabases on linkage groups 2, 7, and 12, respectively, and coincided with large blocks of linkage disequilibrium. For each of these three chromosomes, pairs of segregating, highly divergent alleles were identified, with little or no gene exchange between them. These patterns of recombination and divergence mirror genomic signatures previously described for large polymorphic inversions, which have been shown to repress recombination across extensive chromosomal segments. The lack of genetic exchange permits divergence between noninverted and inverted chromosomes in spite of gene flow. For the rearrangements on linkage groups 2 and 12, allelic frequency shifts between coastal and oceanic environments suggest a role in ecological adaptation, in agreement with recently reported associations between molecular variation within these genomic regions and temperature, oxygen, and salinity levels. Elevated genetic differentiation in these genomic regions has previously been described on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, and we therefore suggest that these polymorphisms are involved in adaptive divergence across the species distributional range.",2016,"chromosomal rearrangements; gene flow; marine organisms; population genomics; ecological adaptation; structural polymorphisms","Article","ISI"

In line with the results of F (st) statistics, significant population structure was detected by applying PCoA and STRUCTURE analysis, which showed discrepant genetic patterns compared to previous studies using neutral markers. Selection tests showed that purifying selection was the predominant evolutionary force acting on the analyzed sequences. Valine substitution by Alanine in a single codon 372 in CYTB gene was detected predominantly (93%) in FA population and temperature was a potentially relevant environmental feature. These findings suggest that local adaptation might be shaping the population structure of marbled rockfish.

Here, 4,122 SNP-containing loci were used to assess structure in southern flounder (Paralichthys lethostigma) sampled across its range in the US Atlantic Ocean (Atlantic) and Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) and relationships among components of genomic variation and spatial and environmental variables were assessed across estuarine population samples in the Gulf. While hierarchical Amova revealed significant heterogeneity within and between the Atlantic and Gulf, pairwise comparisons between samples within ocean basins demonstrated that all significant heterogeneity occurred within the Gulf. The distribution of Tajima's D estimated at a genome-wide scale differed significantly from equilibrium in all estuaries, with more negative values occurring in the Gulf. Components of genomic variation were significantly associated with environmental variables describing individual estuaries, and environment explained a larger component of variation than spatial proximity. Overall, results suggest that there is genetic spatial autocorrelation caused by shared larval sources for proximal nurseries (migration/drift), but that it is modified by environmentally driven differentiation (selection).

Using a large collection of samples covering most parts of the species distribution range, we subjected thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms to coalescent analyses in order to reconstruct a robust worldwide phylogeny of extant G. aculeatus populations, as well as their ancestral geographic distributions using Statistical-Dispersal Vicariance and Bayesian Binary MCMC analyses. The results suggest that contemporary populations originated from the Pacific Ocean in the Late Pleistocene, and the Atlantic was colonized through the Arctic Ocean by a lineage that diverged from Pacific sticklebacks ca 44.6 Kya. This lineage contains two branches: one that is distributed in the Mediterranean area, from the Iberian Peninsula to the Black Sea ('Southern European Clade'), and another that is comprised of populations from northern Europe and the east coast of North America ('Trans-Atlantic Clade').

However, the distinctive biological characteristics and life history of this species, including large body size, long life span, late sexual maturity, and specialization to freezing polar waters, make it particularly vulnerable to overfishing and global climate change. It is therefore of fundamental importance to administer sound management and conservation actions to avoid depletion of this unique species. The crucial issue of whether this species consists of distinct biological units or stocks, which is needed to inform appropriate management and conservation, is currently unresolved. We report here the first RAD-seq analysis of Antarctic toothfish populations, a powerful approach of genome-wide discovery of SNP loci, to assess genetic differentiation between the geographically distant individuals from CCAMLAR Subarea 48.1 locations (South Shetland Islands and West Antarctic Peninsula coasts) and Subarea 88.1 (Ross Sea and McMurdo Sound). We recovered 19,611 SNPs belonging to 13,251 widely shared loci. Comprehensive population structure analyses unambiguously indicated absence of any significant level of population differentiation, thus the null hypothesis of panmixia cannot be rejected.

Even so, regional populations have been shown to be genetically differentiated, including among different foraging specialists (ecotypes) in sympatry. Given the strong matrifocal social structure of this species together with strong resource specializations, understanding the process of differentiation will require an understanding of the relative importance of both genetic drift and local adaptation. Here we provide a high-resolution analysis based on nuclear single-nucleotide polymorphic markers and inference about differentiation at both neutral loci and those potentially under selection. We find that all population comparisons, within or among foraging ecotypes, show significant differentiation, including populations in parapatry and sympatry. Loci putatively under selection show a different pattern of structure compared to neutral loci and are associated with gene ontology terms reflecting physiologically relevant functions (e.g. related to digestion). The pattern of differentiation for one ecotype in the North Pacific suggests local adaptation and shows some fixed differences among sympatric ecotypes. We suggest that differential habitat use and resource specializations have promoted sufficient isolation to allow differential evolution at neutral and functional loci, but that the process is recent and dependent on both selection and drift.",2014,"adaptation; cetacea; ecological genetics; population genomics; sympatric divergence","Article","ISI"

Genotyping a large number of samples can improve the detection of subtle genetic structure, but this may substantially increase sequencing cost and downstream bioinformatics computational time. To overcome this challenge, alternative, cost-effective sequencing approaches, namely Pool-seq and Rapture, have been developed. We empirically measured the power of resolution and congruence of these two methods in documenting weak population structure in nonmodel species with high gene flow comparatively to a conventional genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) approach. For this, we used the American lobster (Homarus americanus) as a case study. First, we found that GBS, Rapture, and Pool-seq approaches gave similar allele frequency estimates (i.e., correlation coefficient over 0.90) and all three revealed the same weak pattern of population structure. Yet, Pool-seq data showed F-ST estimates three to five times higher than GBS and Rapture, while the latter two methods returned similar F-ST estimates, indicating that individual-based approaches provided more congruent results than Pool-seq. We conclude that despite higher costs, GBS and Rapture are more convenient approaches to use in the case of species exhibiting very weak differentiation. While both GBS and Rapture approaches provided similar results with regard to estimates of population genetic parameters, GBS remains more cost-effective in project involving a relatively small numbers of genotyped individuals (e.g., <1,000).

However, determining these boundaries can be difficult when population structure is subtle. Emperor penguins are highly reliant on sea ice, and some populations may be in jeopardy as climate change alters sea-ice extent and quality. An understanding of emperor penguin population structure is therefore urgently needed. Two previous studies have differed in their conclusions, particularly whether the Ross Sea, a major stronghold for the species, is isolated or not. We assessed emperor penguin population structure using 4,596 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), characterized in 110 individuals (10-16 per colony) from eight colonies around Antarctica. In contrast to a previous conclusion that emperor penguins are panmictic around the entire continent, we find that emperor penguins comprise at least four metapopulations, and that the Ross Sea is clearly a distinct metapopulation. Using larger sample sizes and a thorough assessment of the limitations of different analytical methods, we have shown that population structure within emperor penguins does exist and argue that its recognition is vital for the effective conservation of the species. We discuss the many difficulties that molecular ecologists and managers face in the detection and interpretation of subtle population structure using large SNP data sets, and argue that subtle structure should be taken into account when determining management strategies for threatened species, until accurate estimates of demographic connectivity among populations can be made.",2017,"antarctica; dispersal; population genomics; rad-seq; ross sea; southern ocean","Article","ISI"

Environmental salinity serves as a key barrier to the distribution of nearly all aquatic organisms, and species diversification is likely to be enabled by adaptation to alternative osmotic environments. The threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) is a euryhaline species with populations found both in marine and freshwater environments. It has evolved both highly plastic and locally adapted phenotypes due to salinity-derived selection, but the physiological and genetic basis of adaptation to salinity is not fully understood. We integrated comparative cellular morphology of the kidney, a key organ for osmoregulation, and candidate gene expression to explore the underpinnings of evolved variation in osmotic plasticity within two populations of sticklebacks from distinct salinity zones in the Baltic Sea: the high salinity Kattegat, representative of the ancestral marine habitat; and the low salinity Bay of Bothnia. A common-garden experiment revealed that kidney morphology in the ancestral high-salinity population had a highly plastic response to salinity conditions whereas this plastic response was reduced in the low-salinity population. Candidate gene expression in kidney tissue revealed a similar pattern of population specific differences, with a higher degree of plasticity in the native high-salinity population. Together these results suggest that renal cellular morphology has become canalized to low salinity, and that these structural differences may have functional implications for osmoregulation.",2017,"osmoregulation; local adaptation; adaptive plasticity; kidney morphology","Article","ISI"

We use opsin gene expression to test for local adaptation and matching of spectral sensitivity in multiple independent lake populations of threespine stickleback populations derived since the last ice age from an ancestral marine form. We show that sensitivity across the visual spectrum is shifted repeatedly towards longer wavelengths in freshwater compared with the ancestral marine form. Laboratory rearing suggests that this shift is largely genetically based. Using a new metric, we found that the magnitude of shift in spectral sensitivity in each population corresponds strongly to the transition in the availability of different wavelengths of light between the marine and lake environments. We also found evidence of local adaptation by sympatric benthic and limnetic ecotypes to different light environments within lakes. Our findings indicate rapid parallel evolution of the visual system to altered light conditions.

The salmonids are a taxonomic group with abundant genome-wide datasets due to their importance in aquaculture and fisheries. However, the number of documented SVs in salmonids is surprisingly low and is most likely due to removing loci in high linkage disequilibrium when analyzing structure and gene flow. Here we re-analyze RAD-seq data from several populations of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) and document a novel similar to 1.2 MB SV at the distal end of LG12. This variant contains 15 protein-coding genes connected to a wide-range of functions including cell adhesion and signal transduction. Interestingly, we studied the frequency of this polymorphism in four disjointed populations of charr-one each from Nunavut, Newfoundland, Eastern Russia, and Scotland-and found evidence of the variant only in Nunavut, Canada, suggesting the polymorphism is novel and recently evolved.",2021,"chromosomal inversion; salmonids; population genomics; rad-seq; structural variants","Article","ISI"

Studies of highly mobile marine fish populations provide an opportunity to investigate this kind of heterogeneous genomic differentiation, but most studies to this effect have focused on a relatively low number of genetic markers and/or few populations. Hence, the patterns and extent of genomic divergence in high-gene-flow marine fish populations remain poorly understood. Results: We here investigated genome-wide patterns of genetic variability and differentiation in ten marine populations of three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) distributed across a steep salinity and temperature gradient in the Baltic Sea, by utilizing >30,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms obtained with a pooled RAD-seq approach. We found that genetic diversity and differentiation varied widely across the genome, and identified numerous fairly narrow genomic regions exhibiting signatures of both divergent and balancing selection. Evidence was uncovered for substantial genetic differentiation associated with both salinity and temperature gradients, and many candidate genes associated with local adaptation in the Baltic Sea were identified. Conclusions: The patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation, as well as candidate genes associated with adaptation, in Baltic Sea sticklebacks were similar to those observed in earlier comparisons between marine and freshwater populations, suggesting that similar processes may be driving adaptation to brackish and freshwater environments. Taken together, our results provide strong evidence for heterogenic genomic divergence driven by local adaptation in the face of gene flow along an environmental gradient in the post-glacially formed Baltic Sea.",2015,"gasterosteus aculeatus; rad-sequencing; snp; population differentiation; local adaptation; baltic sea","Article","ISI"

Spatial genetic differentiation has been reported in many microbial species indicating significant dispersal barriers among different habitats. Temporal differentiation has been less studied and its frequency, drivers, and magnitude are thus relatively poorly understood. The toxic dinoflagellate species Gambierdiscus caribaeus was sampled during 2 years in the Florida Keys, and repeatedly from 2006 to 2016 at St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands (USVI), including a 3-year period with monthly sampling, enabling a comparison of spatial and temporal genetic differentiation. Samples from the USVI site showed high temporal variability in local population structure, which correlated with changes in salinity and benthic habitat cover. In some cases, temporal variability exceeded spatial differentiation, despite apparent lack of connectivity and dispersal across the Greater Caribbean Region based on the spatial genetic data. Thus, local processes such as selection might have a stronger influence on population structure in microorganisms than geographic distance. The observed high temporal genetic diversity challenges the prediction of harmful algal blooms and toxin concentrations, but illustrates also the evolutionary potential of microalgae to respond to environmental change.",2018,"gambierdiscus; microalgae; population structure; microsatellites; local adaptation; genetic drift","Article","ISI"
"Integrating patterns of thermal tolerance and phenotypic plasticity with population genetics to improve understanding of vulnerability to warming in a widespread copepod","10.1111/gcb.14811","Sasaki, MC; Dam, HG","Differences in population vulnerability to warming are defined by spatial patterns in thermal adaptation. These patterns may be driven by natural selection over spatial environmental gradients, but can also be shaped by gene flow, especially in marine taxa with high dispersal potential. Understanding and predicting organismal responses to warming requires disentangling the opposing effects of selection and gene flow. We begin by documenting genetic divergence of thermal tolerance and developmental phenotypic plasticity. Ten populations of the widespread copepod Acartia tonsa were collected from sites across a large thermal gradient, ranging from the Florida Keys to Northern New Brunswick, Canada (spanning over 20 degrees latitude). Thermal performance curves (TPCs) from common garden experiments revealed local adaptation at the sampling range extremes, with thermal tolerance increasing at low latitudes and decreasing at high latitudes. The opposite pattern was observed in phenotypic plasticity, which was strongest at high latitudes. No relationship was observed between phenotypic plasticity and environmental variables. Instead, the results are consistent with the hypothesis of a trade-off between thermal tolerance and the strength of phenotypic plasticity. Over a large portion of the sampled range, however, we observed a remarkable lack of differentiation of TPCs. To examine whether this lack of divergence is the result of selection for a generalist performance curve or constraint by gene flow, we analyzed cytochrome oxidase I mtDNA sequences, which revealed four distinct genetic clades, abundant genetic diversity, and widely distributed haplotypes. Strong divergence in thermal performance within genetic clades, however, suggests that the pace of thermal adaptation can be relatively rapid. The combined insight from the laboratory physiological experiments and genetic data indicate that gene flow constrains differentiation of TPCs. This balance between gene flow and selection has implications for patterns of vulnerability to warming. Taking both genetic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity into account, our results suggest that local adaptation does not increase vulnerability to warming, and that low-latitude populations in general may be more vulnerable to predicted temperature change over the next century.",2019,"climate change; climate variability hypothesis; copepod; gene flow; local adaptation; macrophysiology; phenotypic plasticity; plankton; rapid adaptation; thermal performance","Article","ISI"
"Evolutionary and biogeographical patterns of barnacles from deep-sea hydrothermal vents","10.1111/mec.13054","Herrera, S; Watanabe, H; Shank, TM","The characterization of evolutionary and biogeographical patterns is of fundamental importance to identify factors driving biodiversity. Due to their widespread but discontinuous distribution, deep-sea hydrothermal vent barnacles represent an excellent model for testing biogeographical hypotheses regarding the origin, dispersal and diversity of modern vent fauna. Here, we characterize the global genetic diversity of vent barnacles to infer their time of radiation, place of origin, mode of dispersal and diversification. Our approach was to target a suite of multiple loci in samples representing seven of the eight described genera. We also performed restriction-site associated DNA sequencing on individuals from each species. Phylogenetic inferences and topology hypothesis tests indicate that vent barnacles have colonized deep-sea hydrothermal vents at least twice in history. Consistent with preliminary estimates, we find a likely radiation of barnacles in vent ecosystems during the Cenozoic. Our analyses suggest that the western Pacific was the place of origin of the major vent barnacle lineage, followed by circumglobal colonization eastwards through the Southern Hemisphere during the Neogene. The inferred time of radiation rejects the classic hypotheses of antiquity of vent taxa. The timing and the mode of origin, radiation and dispersal are consistent with recent inferences made for other deep-sea taxa, including nonvent species, and are correlated with the occurrence of major geological events and mass extinctions. Thus, we suggest that the geological processes and dispersal mechanisms discussed here can explain the current distribution patterns of many other marine taxa and have played an important role shaping deep-sea faunal diversity. These results also constitute the critical baseline data with which to assess potential effects of anthropogenic disturbances on deep-sea ecosystems.",2015,"cenozoic; dispersal; hydrothermal vents; polyphyly; southern hemisphere; species delimitation; rad-seq","Article","ISI"

We report 17 polymorphic rearrangements in a single locality for the coastal marine snail, Littorina saxatilis. Patterns of diversity in the field and of recombination in controlled crosses provide strong evidence that at least the majority of these rearrangements are inversions. Most show clinal changes in frequency between habitats, suggestive of divergent selection, but only one appears to be fixed for different arrangements in the two habitats.

We assessed DNA yield, purity, efficacy and cost of each method. Extraction efficacy was quantified using the proportion of successful polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of two molecular markers for metazoans (mitochondrial COI and nuclear histone 3) and one for Ochrophyta (mitochondrial nad6) at four time points - 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 years following extraction. DNA yield and purity were quantified using NanoDrop absorbance ratios. Cost was estimated in terms of time and material expense. Results show differences in DNA yield, purity and PCR success between extraction methods and that performance also varied by taxon.

Utilizing genotype data in the absence of a reference genome, however, presents a number of challenges. One major challenge is the trade-off between splitting alleles at a single locus into separate clusters (loci), creating inflated homozygosity, and lumping multiple loci into a single contig (locus), creating artefacts and inflated heterozygosity. This issue has been addressed primarily through the use of similarity cut-offs in sequence clustering. Here, two commonly employed, postclustering filtering methods (read depth and excess heterozygosity) used to identify incorrectly assembled loci are compared with haplotyping, another postclustering filtering approach. Simulated and empirical data sets were used to demonstrate that each of the three methods separately identified incorrectly assembled loci; more optimal results were achieved when the three methods were applied in combination. The results confirmed that including incorrectly assembled loci in population-genetic data sets inflates estimates of heterozygosity and deflates estimates of population divergence. Additionally, at low levels of population divergence, physical linkage between SNPs within a locus created artificial clustering in analyses that assume markers are independent. Haplotyping SNPs within a locus effectively neutralized the physical linkage issue without having to thin data to a single SNP per locus. We introduce a Perl script that haplotypes polymorphisms, using data from single or paired-end reads, and identifies potentially problematic loci.",2017,"nonmodel species; population genomics; single-nucleotide polymorphisms","Article","ISI"

Here, we adopted a combined approach, integrating restriction-siteassociated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) and acoustic telemetry to establish country-wide demographic structure, diversity and connectivity, and the origins of Nassau grouper using an active fish spawning aggregation (FSA) in the central Bahamas. RAD-seq analysis of 94 Nassau grouper sampled from nine locations in The Bahamas generated a working dataset of 13,241 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Similar levels of genetic diversity were found among sampled locations. Evidence of population sub-structuring across The Bahamas was demonstrated and supported by discriminate analysis of principal components (DAPCs) along with analyses of molecular variance (AMOVAs). Associated acoustic telemetry data indicated Nassau grouper tagged at an active FSA in the central Bahamas during the 2016-2017 spawning season migrated to the Exumas at the conclusion of the spawning period. Telemetry data suggest the likely origins of five individuals, which traveled one-way distances of up to 176 km from the FSA in the central Bahamas to two sites within a no-take marine protected area (MPA). Analyses of high-resolution SNP markers (including candidate loci under selection) illustrated patterns of spatial structure and genetic connectivity not reflected by telemetry data alone.

Individual- and population-level variation in body size and growth often correlates with many fitness traits. Predation and food availability are expected to affect body size and growth as important agents of both natural selection and phenotypic plasticity. How differences in predation and food availability affect body size/growth during ontogeny in populations adapted to different predation and competition regimes is rarely studied. 2. Nine-spined stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) populations originating from habitats with varying levels of predation and competition are known to be locally adapted to their respective habitats in terms of body size and growth. Here, we studied how different levels of perceived predation risk and competition during ontogeny affect the reaction norms of body size and growth in (i) marine and pond populations adapted to different levels of predation and competition and (ii) different sexes. We reared nine-spined stickleback in a factorial experiment under two levels of perceived predation risk (present/absent) and competition (high/low food supply). 3. We found divergence in the reaction norms at two levels: (i) predation-adapted marine stickleback had stronger reactions to predatory cues than intraspecific competition-adapted pond stickleback, the latter being more sensitive to available food than the marine fish and (ii) females reacting more strongly to the treatments than males. 4. The repeated, habitat-dependent nature of the differences suggests that natural selection is the agent behind the observed patterns. Our results suggest that genetic adaptation to certain environmental factors also involves an increase in the range of expressible phenotypic plasticity.

To determine whether fluctuations in population sizes are localised or indicative of large-scale ecosystem change, we must first understand population structure and dispersal. King penguins are long-lived seabirds that occupy a niche across the sub-Antarctic zone close to the Polar Front. Colonies have very different histories of exploitation, population recovery, and expansion. Results: We investigated the genetic population structure and patterns of colonisation of king penguins across their current range using a dataset of 5154 unlinked, high-coverage single nucleotide polymorphisms generated via restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RADSeq). Despite breeding at a small number of discrete, geographically separate sites, we find only very slight genetic differentiation among colonies separated by thousands of kilometers of open-ocean, suggesting migration among islands and archipelagos may be common. Our results show that the South Georgia population is slightly differentiated from all other colonies and suggest that the recently founded Falkland Island colony is likely to have been established by migrants from the distant Crozet Islands rather than nearby colonies on South Georgia, possibly as a result of density-dependent processes. Conclusions: The observed subtle differentiation among king penguin colonies must be considered in future conservation planning and monitoring of the species, and demographic models that attempt to forecast extinction risk in response to large-scale climate change must take into account migration. It is possible that migration could buffer king penguins against some of the impacts of climate change where colonies appear panmictic, although it is unlikely to protect them completely given the widespread physical changes projected for their Southern Ocean foraging grounds.

We detected substantial genetic differentiation between the lake and the putative ancestral refuge river in five species but we also found that these species have experienced different population dynamics. Some species appear to have colonized the lake after the Last Glacial Maximum, while others harbour levels of genetic differentiation consistent with the presence of refugia in the lake that could have persisted during glacial maxima or suggestive of colonization from a distinct source.

Fish were exposed to a daily hypoxia challenge of 6h below 62% saturation, down to a minimum of 10 +/- 5% saturation, followed by a return to normoxia. Respiratory and haematological variables were assessed after 8 and 16 days of daily hypoxia exposure. Hypoxia tolerance (measured as the critical oxygen tension; [O-2](crit)) was not different between populations and not different from control fish after 8 days ([O-2](crit)=20.7 +/- 2.8% saturation), but improved similarly in both populations after 16 days ([O-2](crit)=16.5 +/- 3.1% saturation). This improvement corresponded with increases in haematocrit and haemoglobin, but not an increase in the mean cell haemoglobin concentration.

However, recent evidence suggests that native prey sometimes exhibit induced defenses to introduced predators, as a result of rapid evolution or other processes. We examined whether Olympia oysters (Ostrea lurida) display inducible defenses in the presence of an invasive predator, the Atlantic oyster drill (Urosalpinx cinerea), and whether these responses vary among oyster populations from estuaries with and without this predator. We spawned oysters from six populations distributed among three estuaries in northern California, USA, and raised their offspring through two generations under common conditions to minimize effects of environmental history. We exposed second-generation oysters to cue treatments: drills eating oysters, drills eating barnacles, or control seawater. Oysters from all populations grew smaller shells when exposed to drill cues, and grew thicker and harder shells when those drills were eating oysters. Oysters exposed to drills eating other oysters were subsequently preyed upon at a slower rate. Although all oyster populations exhibited inducible defenses, oysters from the estuary with the greatest exposure to drills grew the smallest shells suggesting that oyster populations have evolved adaptive differences in the strength of their responses to predators.

However, wide application of ddRAD-seq technology in plant species has not been achieved so far. Here, we aim to develop an optimized ddRAD library preparation protocol be accessible to most angiosperm plant species without much startup pre-experiment and costs. Results: We first tested several combinations of enzymes by in silico analysis of 23 plant species covering 17 families of angiosperm and 1 family of bryophyta and found AvaII + MspI enzyme pair produced consistently higher number of fragments in a broad range of plant species. Then we removed two purifying and one quantifying steps of the original protocol, replaced expensive consumables and apparatuses by conventional experimental apparatuses. Besides, we shortened P1 adapter from 37 to 25 bp and designed a new barcode-adapter system containing 20 pairs of barcodes of varying length. This is an optimized ddRAD strategy for angiosperm plants that is economical, time-saving and requires little technical expertise or investment in laboratory equipment. We refer to this simplified protocol as MiddRAD and we demonstrated the utility and flexibility of our approach by resolving phylogenetic relationships of two genera of woody bamboos (Dendrocalamus and Phyllostachys). Overall our results provide empirical evidence for using this method on different model and non-model plants to produce consistent data. Conclusions: As MiddRAD adopts an enzyme pair that works for a broad range of angiosperm plants, simplifies library constructing procedure and requires less DNA input, it will greatly facilitate designing a ddRAD project. Our optimization of this method may make ddRAD be widely used in fields of plant population genetics, phylogenetics, phylogeography and molecular breeding.",2016,"rad-seq; ddrad; middrad; genotype-by-sequencing; next-generation sequencing","Article","ISI"

In many cases delimitations rely on subjective interpretations of morphological and/or DNA data. Species with inadequate genetic resources needed to answer questions regarding evolutionary relatedness and genetic uniqueness are particularly problematic. In this study, we demonstrate the utility of restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) to objectively resolve unambiguous phylogenetic relationships in a recalcitrant group of deep-sea corals with divergences >80 million years. We infer robust species boundaries in the genus Paragorgia by testing alternative delimitation hypotheses using a Bayes Factors delimitation method. We present substantial evidence rejecting the current morphological species delimitation model for the genus and infer the presence of cryptic species associated with environmental variables. We argue that the suitability limits of RAD-seq for phylogenetic inferences cannot be assessed in terms of absolute time, but are contingent on taxon-specific factors. We show that classical taxonomy can greatly benefit from integrative approaches that provide objective tests to species delimitation hypotheses. Our results lead the way for addressing further questions in marine biogeography, community ecology, population dynamics, conservation, and evolution. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Recent decline in cod stocks in the North Sea-Skagerrak-Kattegat shifts the sources of larval supply","10.1111/fog.12146","Jonsson, PR; Corell, H; Andre, C; Svedang, H; Moksnes, PO","Cod stocks in the North Sea, including the Kattegat and the Skagerrak, have declined dramatically since the 1970s. Occasionally there is a high recruitment of juveniles in Kattegat/Skagerrak, without leading to the rebuilding of adult cod stocks despite reduced fishing mortality. In a biophysical model of egg and larval drift, we examined the potential importance of extant and historical spawning grounds for recruitment of cod in the Kattegat/Skagerrak seas using data of spawning stock biomass from the 1970s and from today's reduced stocks. The results suggest that Kattegat in the 1970s relied on largely locally retained (83%) larvae with little annual variation in recruitment. Kattegat also provided a substantial proportion of larvae recruiting in Swedish Skagerrak (72%). This is in contrast to present conditions where the Kattegat spawning stock has been reduced by 94%, and Kattegat only provides 34% of locally retained larvae and 30% to Swedish Skagerrak. Instead, the protected area in the oresund and the Belt Sea are expected today to provide most larvae recruiting in Kattegat. Also, the inflow of larvae from the North Sea to Skagerrak and Kattegat can be significant although highly variable between years, with a positive correlation to the North-Atlantic Oscillation index (NAO). The rebuilding of healthy spawning areas in the Kattegat may be key for restoring local cod stocks in both Kattegat and along the Skagerrak coast. This poses a management challenge if cod with local Kattegat' adaptations, e.g., in terms of egg density and migration patterns, are lost or reduced to non-resilient densities.",2016,"biophysical model; egg and larval dispersal; gadus morhua; kattegat; local adaptation; management; overfishing; skagerrak","Article","ISI"
"Genetic and morphological variation in two littorinid gastropods: evidence for recent population expansions along the East African coast","10.1111/j.1095-8312.2012.02041.x","Silva, SE; Silva, IC; Madeira, C; Sallema, R; Paulo, OS; Paula, J","In marine species, population diversity and differentiation is affected by the population history and by the complex interaction between oceanographic dynamics and ecological traits. In the present study, we examined two species of marine gastropods (the mangrove periwinkle Littoraria scabra and the rocky shore Littoraria glabrata) along the East African coast, using both genetic and geometric morphometric methods. We report a greater variation of shell shape in L.scabra compared to the slightly smaller variation in L.glabrata. This variation was probably associated with variation of environmental factors along the coast, such as temperature and hydrodynamics. Despite morphological variation, we found low mitochondrial genetic differentiation among samples from different localities for both species, which is probably a consequence of the ongoing gene flow during the free-swimming larval stage of these gastropods. Additionally, high levels of haplotype diversity, low nucleotide diversity, and star-like' genealogies were found in both species. These observations and the results from mismatch distributions, indicate a possible signature of recent population expansions in both species, which probably started during interglacial periods of the Pleistocene and led to the colonization of the Indian Ocean coast.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 108, 494-508.",2013,"haplotypes; littoraria glabrata; littoraria scabra; local adaptation; mtdna; population expansion; shell morphometrics; western indian ocean","Article","ISI"
"The genomic signature of parallel adaptation from shared genetic variation","10.1111/mec.12720","Roesti, M; Gavrilets, S; Hendry, AP; Salzburger, W; Berner, D","Parallel adaptation is common and may often occur from shared genetic variation, but the genomic consequences of this process remain poorly understood. We first use individual-based simulations to demonstrate that comparisons between populations adapted in parallel to similar environments from shared variation reveal a characteristic genomic signature around a selected locus: a low-divergence valley centred at the locus and flanked by twin peaks of high divergence. This signature is initiated by the hitchhiking of haplotype tracts differing between derived populations in the broader neighbourhood of the selected locus (driving the high-divergence twin peaks) and shared haplotype tracts in the tight neighbourhood of the locus (driving the low-divergence valley). This initial hitchhiking signature is reinforced over time because the selected locus acts as a barrier to gene flow from the source to the derived populations, thus promoting divergence by drift in its close neighbourhood. We next empirically confirm the peak-valley-peak signature by combining targeted and RAD sequence data at three candidate adaptation genes in multiple marine (source) and freshwater (derived) populations of threespine stickleback. Finally, we use a genome-wide screen for the peak-valley-peak signature to discover additional genome regions involved in parallel marine-freshwater divergence. Our findings offer a new explanation for heterogeneous genomic divergence and thus challenge the standard view that peaks in population divergence harbour divergently selected loci and that low-divergence regions result from balancing selection or localized introgression. We anticipate that genome scans for peak-valley-peak divergence signatures will promote the discovery of adaptation genes in other organisms.",2014,"barrier to gene flow; evolutionary genomics; gasterosteus aculeatus; genetic hitchhiking; genome scan; population divergence","Article","ISI"

However, the effects of heatwaves may differ among geographically separated populations depending on their capacity for thermal plasticity. Here, we compared the response to simulated summer heatwave temperatures (+1.5 and +3.0 degrees C above average) in two populations of a coral reef damselfish with different capacities for thermal plasticity. We found that the more thermally tolerant population had greater plasticity of gene expression and had significantly more downregulated genes, which may provide more energy to repair damage associated with thermal stress and to maintain basic functions at these extreme temperatures. In contrast, the thermally sensitive population exhibited higher basal levels of heat shock proteins and had three times fewer changes in gene expression overall. The limited changes in gene regulation suggest that individuals have reduced genome plasticity to tolerate thermal fluctuations and consequently may not have enough energy to repair damage and resume cellular homeostasis at extreme temperatures. Thus, we have identified the molecular signatures of how two genetically distinct fish populations cope with an extreme thermal event, and why they differ in their capacity for thermal plasticity.",2018,"climate change; heatwaves; ocean warming; transcriptomics; genomics; local adaptation; plasticity","Article","ISI"
"Differences in induced thermotolerance among populations of Olympia oysters","10.1016/j.cbpa.2019.110563","Bible, JM; Evans, TG; Sanford, E","An organism's ability to cope with thermal stress is an important predictor of survival in a changing climate. One way in which organisms may acclimatize to thermal stress in the short-term is through induced thermotolerance, whereby exposure to a sublethal heat shock enables the organism to subsequently survive what might otherwise be a lethal event. Whether induced thermotolerance is related to basal thermotolerance is not well understood for marine organisms. Furthermore, whether populations often differ in their capacity for induced thermotolerance is also unclear. Here, we tested for differences in basal thermotolerance and induced thermotolerance among six populations of Olympia oysters (Ostrea lurida) from three California estuaries. Oysters were raised under common-garden laboratory conditions for a generation and then exposed to two treatments (control or sublethal heat shock) followed by a spectrum of temperatures that bound the upper critical temperature in order to determine LT50 (temperature at which 50% of the population dies). All populations exhibited induced thermotolerance by increasing their LT50 to a similar maximum temperature when extreme thermal stress was preceded by a sublethal heat shock. However, populations differed in their basal thermotolerance and their plasticity in thermotolerance. Populations with the highest basal thermotolerance were least able to modify upper critical temperature, while the population with the lowest basal thermotolerance exhibited the greatest plasticity in the upper critical temperature. Our results highlight that populations with high basal thermotolerance may be most vulnerable to climate warming because they lack the plasticity required to adjust their upper thermal limits.",2020,"thermotolerance; induced thermotolerance; heat shock protein; local adaptation; climate change; olympia oyster; ostrea lurida","Article","ISI"

New power to assay these genome-wide effects of selection comes from associating multi-locus patterns of polymorphism with gene expression and function. Here, we performed one of the first genome-wide surveys in a marine species, comparing purple sea urchins, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, from two distant locations along the species' wide latitudinal range. We examined 9112 polymorphic loci from upstream non-coding and coding regions of genes for signatures of selection with respect to gene function and tissue-and ontogenetic gene expression. We found that genetic differentiation (F-ST) varied significantly across functional gene classes. The strongest enrichment occurred in the upstream regions of E3 ligase genes, enzymes known to regulate protein abundance during development and environmental stress. We found enrichment for high heterozygosity in genes directly involved in immune response, particularly NALP genes, which mediate pro-inflammatory signals during bacterial infection. We also found higher heterozygosity in immune genes in the southern population, where disease incidence and pathogen diversity are greater. Similar to the major histocompatibility complex in mammals, balancing selection may enhance genetic diversity in the innate immune system genes of this invertebrate. Overall, our results show that how genome-wide polymorphism data coupled with growing databases on gene function and expression can combine to detect otherwise hidden signals of selection in natural populations.",2012,"population genomics; natural selection; gene flow; strongylocentrotus purpuratus; ubiquitin; innate immunity","Article","ISI"

Intrinsic reproductive isolation is often emphasized in the former and local adaptation in the latter, although both reduce gene flow between groups. Rarely are these two patterns of spatial distribution reported in the same study system. Here, we report that the long-snouted seahorse Hippocampus guttulatus is subdivided into discrete panmictic entities by both types of hybrid zones. Along the European Atlantic coasts, a northern and a southern lineage meet in the southwest of France where they coexist in sympatryi.e., in the same geographical zonewith little hybridization. In the Mediterranean Sea, two lineages have a mosaic distribution, associated with lagoon-like and marine habitats. A fifth lineage was identified in the Black Sea. Genetic homogeneity over large spatial scales contrasts with isolation maintained in sympatry or close parapatry at a fine scale. A high variation in locus-specific introgression rates provides additional evidence that partial reproductive isolation must be maintaining the divergence. We find that fixed differences between lagoon and marine populations in the Mediterranean Sea belong to the most differentiated SNPs between the two Atlantic lineages, against the genome-wide pattern of structure that mostly follow geography. These parallel outlier SNPs cluster on a single chromosome-wide island of differentiation. Since Atlantic lineages do not map to lagoon-sea habitat variation, genetic parallelism at the genomic island suggests a shared genetic barrier contributes to reproductive isolation in contrasting contexts-i.e., spatial versus ecological. We discuss how a genomic hotspot of parallel differentiation could have evolved and become associated both with space and with a patchy environment in a single study system.",2019,"clinal hybrid zone; ecological speciation; local adaptation; mosaic hybrid zone; parallel evolution; reproductive isolation","Article","ISI"

As females have the higher growth rate and economic value, the production of all female stocks is extremely essential in aquaculture. However, the sex determination mechanism is still unclear. Development of sex-specific genetic markers based on next-generation sequencing proved to be an effective tool for discovering sex determination system in various animals.ResultsRestriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) was employed to isolate sex-specific SNP markers for S. paramamosain. A total of 335.6 million raw reads were obtained from 20 individuals, of which 204.7 million were from 10 females and 130.9 million from 10 males. After sequence assembly and female-male comparison, 20 SNP markers were identified to be sex-specific. Furthermore, ten SNPs in a short sequence (285bp) were confirmed heterozygous in females and homozygous in males in a large population by PCR amplification and sequencing. Subsequently, a female-specific primer was successfully designed according to the female-specific nucleotide which could amplify an expected band from females but not from males. Thus, a rapid and effective method for molecular sexing in S. paramamosain was developed, meanwhile, this method could successfully identify the sex of S. tranquebarica and S. serrata. Finally, nine and four female-specific SNP markers were detected in S. tranquebarica and S. serrata, respectively.ConclusionsSex-specific SNP markers were firstly identified in crab species and showed female heterogamety and male homogamety, which provided strong genetic evidence for a WZ/ZZ sex determination system in mud crabs S. paramamosain, S. tranquebarica and S. serrata.

"Local adaptation along a continuous coastline: Prey recruitment drives differentiation in a predatory snail","10.1890/09-0536.1","Sanford, E; Worth, DJ","Recent work demonstrates that nearshore oceanography can generate strong variation in the delivery of resources (nutrients and larvae) to benthic marine communities over spatial scales of. tens to hundreds of kilometers. Moreover, variation in the strength of these bottom-up inputs is often spatially consistent. linked to regional centers of upwelling. coastal topography, and other stable features of the coastline. Whereas the ecological effects of these oceanographic links are increasingly clear, the possibility that these same bottom-up forces might impose spatially varying selection on consumers has not been addressed. Here, we test the hypothesis that a carnivorous snail (Nucella canaliculata) with direct development is locally adapted to persistent differences in prey recruitment within two adjacent oceanographic regions (northern California and Oregon. USA). Previous laboratory studies demonstrated that snails from Oregon rarely drilled the thick-shelled mussel Mytilus californianus. whereas snails from California readily drilled this prey. To test whether these differences reflect local adaptation, snails from two populations in each region were raised through two laboratory generations to minimize the potential influence of nongenetic effects. We then reciprocally outplanted these F2 generation snails to field enclosures at each of the four sites and monitored their growth for 11 months. Recruitment and availability of preferred prey (the acorn barnacle Balanus glandula and blue mussel Mytilus trossulus) at the experimental sites were 1-3 orders of magnitude lower in California than in Oregon. At the California sites, snails that originated from Oregon sources failed to drill larger californianus, encountered few alternative prey, and showed almost no growth. In contrast. snails from California drilled M. californianus and showed substantial growth. These results strongly suggest that the capacity of California snails to drill M. californianus allows these snails to succeed in an oceanographic region where the recruitment of alternative, preferred prey is low. More broadly, our results suggest that persistent spatial variation in recruitment and other oceanographically mediated processes may lead to adaptive differentiation among populations of consumers in adjacent coastal regions.",2010,"bottom-up effects; coastal oceanography; divergent natural selection; geographic variation; larval recruitment; local adaptation; mytilus; nucella; reciprocal transfer experiment; rocky intertidal communities","Article","ISI"

Genetic approaches can provide indirect measures of connectivity, allowing the identification of genetically differentiated - unconnected - populations. In this study, we applied a 2b-RAD approach based on hundreds of polymorphic loci to provide the first detailed insight into the population genomics of the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis in part of its native geographical range. We sampled 19 localities within the Mediterranean and Black Seas, and analyzed a total of 478 samples. We detected strong differences between the two seas, whereas no differences were found between samples from the Western and Central Mediterranean and within Western Mediterranean samples. In the Central Mediterranean a significant differentiation emerged comparing Central Adriatic samples with those from South Adriatic and Ionian Seas. Furthermore, an East-to-West genetic structuring was found in the Central Adriatic Sea, which was not present in the Southern Adriatic and Ionian Seas. These results possibly reflect the local oceanography, with a Middle Adriatic gyre unable to prevent genetic differentiation in this species, and a Southern Adriatic gyre that effectively mixes propagules in Southern areas. In the Black Sea, no signal of genetic structure was found, although samples were spaced at similar distances as in the Adriatic-Ionian area. Genetic connectivity patterns of M. galloprovincialis reveal peculiar species-specific features respect to other species with similar larval duration, suggesting caution in using genetic connectivity data of single species in defining conservation units. We recommend of using genetic connectivity data of many species representing a variety of life history traits, and we call for new investigations using high resolution population genomics, particularly in the Black Sea, to understand if areas separated by hundreds of kilometers can be considered genetically connected as mussels' data suggest.

This ocean acidification has negative but variable impacts on individual performance in many marine species. However, little is known about the adaptive capacity of species to respond to an acidified ocean, and, as a result, predictions regarding future ecosystem responses remain incomplete. Here we demonstrate that ocean acidification generates striking patterns of genome-wide selection in purple sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) cultured under different CO2 levels. We examined genetic change at 19,493 loci in larvae from seven adult populations cultured under realistic future CO2 levels. Although larval development and morphology showed little response to elevated CO2, we found substantial allelic change in 40 functional classes of proteins involving hundreds of loci. Pronounced genetic changes, including excess amino acid replacements, were detected in all populations and occurred in genes for biomineralization, lipid metabolism, and ion homeostasis-gene classes that build skeletons and interact in pH regulation. Such genetic change represents a neglected and important impact of ocean acidification that may influence populations that show few outward signs of response to acidification. Our results demonstrate the capacity for rapid evolution in the face of ocean acidification and show that standing genetic variation could be a reservoir of resilience to climate change in this coastal upwelling ecosystem.

We compared populations of J. singaporensis with that of the non-threatened, widespread, abundant, and eurytopic freshwater crab, Parathelphusa maculata, and found surprisingly high congruence between their population genomic histories.

We investigated the genomic signatures of local adaptation in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.) along a natural salinity gradient, ranging from 35% in the North Sea to 7% within the Baltic Sea. By utilizing a 12K SNPchip, we simultaneously assessed neutral and adaptive genetic divergence across the Atlantic cod genome. Combining outlier analyses with a landscape genomic approach, we identified a set of directionally selected loci that are strongly correlated with habitat differences in salinity, oxygen, and temperature. Our results show that discrete regions within the Atlantic cod genome are subject to directional selection and associated with adaptation to the local environmental conditions in the Baltic-and the North Sea, indicating divergence hitchhiking and the presence of genomic islands of divergence. We report a suite of outlier single nucleotide polymorphisms within or closely located to genes associated with osmoregulation, as well as genes known to play important roles in the hydration and development of oocytes. These genes are likely to have key functions within a general osmoregulatory framework and are important for the survival of eggs and larvae, contributing to the buildup of reproductive isolation between the low-salinity adapted Baltic cod and the adjacent cod populations. Hence, our data suggest that adaptive responses to the environmental conditions in the Baltic Sea may contribute to a strong and effective reproductive barrier, and that Baltic cod can be viewed as an example of ongoing speciation.",2015,"atlantic cod; baltic sea; ecological divergence; genomic adaptation; population genomics; snps; speciation","Article","ISI"
"Genomic Architecture of Rapid Parallel Adaptation to Fresh Water in a Wild Fish","10.1093/molbev/msaa290","Zong, SB; Li, YL; Liu, JX","Rapid adaptation to novel environments may drive changes in genomic regions through natural selection. However, the genetic architecture underlying these adaptive changes is still poorly understood. Using population genomic approaches, we investigated the genomic architecture that underlies rapid parallel adaptation of Coilia nasus to fresh water by comparing four freshwater-resident populations with their ancestral anadromous population. Linkage disequilibrium network analysis and population genetic analyses revealed two putative large chromosome inversions on LG6 and LG22, which were enriched for outlier loci and exhibited parallel association with freshwater adaptation. Drastic frequency shifts and elevated genetic differentiation were observed for the two chromosome inversions among populations, suggesting that both inversions would undergo divergent selection between anadromous and resident ecotypes. Enrichment analysis of genes within chromosome inversions showed significant enrichment of genes involved in metabolic process, immunoregulation, growth, maturation, osmoregulation, and so forth, which probably underlay differences in morphology, physiology and behavior between the anadromous and freshwater-resident forms. The availability of beneficial standing genetic variation, large optimum shift between marine and freshwater habitats, and high efficiency of selection with large population size could lead to the observed rapid parallel adaptive genomic change. We propose that chromosomal inversions might have played an important role during the evolution of rapid parallel ecological divergence in the face of environmental heterogeneity in C. nasus. Our study provides insights into the genomic basis of rapid adaptation of complex traits in novel habitats and highlights the importance of structural genomic variants in analyses of ecological adaptation.",2021,"parallel evolution; local adaptation; chromosome inversion; complex traits; standing genetic variation","Article","ISI"

In several Mediterranean fish species, alternative migration patterns exist between individuals entering coastal lagoons that offer favourable conditions for growth and those staying in the sea where environmental conditions are less subject to rapid and stressful change. Whether these coexisting strategies are phenotypically plastic or include a role for local adaptation through differential survival needs to be determined. Here, we explore the genetic basis of alternate habitat use in western Mediterranean populations of the gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata). Samples from lagoonal and open-sea habitats were typed for three candidate gene microsatellite loci, seven anonymous microsatellites and 44 amplified fragment length polymorphism markers to test for genotypeenvironment associations. While anonymous markers globally indicated high levels of gene flow across geographic locations and habitats, non-neutral differentiation patterns correlated with habitat type were found at two candidate microsatellite loci located in the promoter region of the growth hormone and prolactin genes. Further analysis of these two genes revealed that a mechanism based on habitat choice alone could not explain the distribution of genotype frequencies at a regional scale, thus implying a role for differential survival between habitats. We also found an association between allele size and habitat type, which, in the light of previous studies, suggests that polymorphisms in the proximal promoter region could influence gene expression by modulating transcription factor binding, thus providing a potential explanatory link between genotype and growth phenotype in nature.",2012,"gene flow; genotype-environment association; growth hormone; habitat choice; local adaptation; prolactin","Article","ISI"

In Pocillopora corals, nine recently identified genetic lineages disagree fundamentally with the 17 recognized Pocillopora species, including 5 major Indo-Pacific reef-builders. Pocillopora corals hybridize in the Tropical Eastern Pacific, so it is possible that some of the disagreement between the genetics and taxonomy may be due to introgressive hybridization. Here we used 6769 genome-wide SNPs from Restriction-site Associated DNA Sequencing (RAD-Seq) to conduct phylogenomic comparisons among three common, Indo-Pacific Pocillopora species - P. damicomis, P. eydouxi and P. elegans - within and between populations in the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP) and the Central Pacific. Genome-wide RAD-Seq comparisons of Central and TEP Pocillopora confirm that the morphospecies P. damicornis, P. eydouxi and P. elegans are not monophyletic, but instead fall into three distinct genetic groups. However, hybrid samples shared fixed alleles with their respective parental species and, even without strict monophyly, P. damicomis share a common set of 33 species-specific alleles across the Pacific. RAD-Seq data confirm the pattern of one-way introgressive hybridization among TEP Pocillopora, suggesting that introgression may play a role in generating shared, polyphyletic lineages among currently recognized Pocillopora species. Levels of population differentiation within genetic lineages indicate significantly higher levels of population differentiation in the Tropical Eastern Pacific than in the Central West Pacific.

We analyzed a total of 256 markers (120 microsatellites and 136 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms SNPs), several of them associated to Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) for growth and resistance to pathologies, with the aim to identify potential adaptive variation in turbot Scophthalmus maximus L The study area in the Northeastern Atlantic Ocean, from Iberian Peninsula to the Baltic Sea, involves a gradual change in temperature and an abrupt change in salinity conditions. We detected 27 candidate loci putatively under selection. At least four of the five SNPs identified as outliers are located within genes coding for ribosomal proteins or directly related with the production of cellular proteins. One of the detected outliers, previously identified as part of a QTL for growth, is a microsatellite linked to a gene coding for a growth factor receptor. A similar set of outliers was detected when natural populations were compared with a sample subjected to strong artificial selection for growth along four generations. The observed association between F-ST outliers and growth-related QTL supports the hypothesis of changes in growth as an adaptation to differences in temperature and salinity conditions. However, further work is needed to confirm this hypothesis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2015,"adaptation; atlantic ocean; fish; population genomics","Article","ISI"
"Genetic heterogeneity and local adaptation of Asian seabass across Indonesian Archipelago revealed with gene-associated SNP markers","10.1016/j.fishres.2015.06.012","Wang, L; Wan, ZY; Lim, HS; Yue, GH","Asian seabass is an important marine foodfish species in Asia-Pacific region. Previous studies using microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA sequences showed that the populations in Australia are significantly different from those in Southeast Asia. However, within Australian and Southeast Asian populations, there are some conflicts regarding to population differentiations. It is essential for us to use more DNA markers to examine the population structure of Asian seabass. We collected Asian seabass samples from seven wild populations distributed across Indonesian Archipelago from Southeast Asia to Australia and Papua New Guinea. We measured the genetic diversity within each population and analyzed the genetic relationships among the wild populations using 96 SNPs. We detected significant population differentiations among the seven wild populations of Asian seabass. The genetic diversity in Southeast Asian populations was significantly higher than that in Australian and Papua New Guinean populations. There were significant genetic differentiations among the Australian and Papua New Guinean populations while the differentiation in Southeast Asian populations was minor. In addition, we identified footprints of directional selection at three loci using outlier tests. Our data supply useful information about the management of wild stocks of Asian seabass and the use of wild Asian seabass to start a breeding program. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, for many threatened species, we still know surprisingly little about the extent of naturally occurring adaptive variation in heat-tolerance. Here, we show that the thermal tolerances of green turtle (Chelonia mydas) embryos in a single, island-breeding population have diverged in response to the contrasting incubation temperatures of nesting beaches just a few kilometres apart. In natural nests and in a common-garden rearing experiment, the offspring of females nesting on a naturally hot (black sand) beach survived better and grew larger at hot incubation temperatures compared with the offspring of females nesting on a cooler (pale sand) beach nearby. These differences were owing to shallower thermal reaction norms in the hot beach population, rather than shifts in thermal optima, and could not be explained by egg-mediated maternal effects. Our results suggest that marine turtle nesting behaviour can drive adaptive differentiation at remarkably fine spatial scales, and have important implications for how we define conservation units for protection. In particular, previous studies may have underestimated the extent of adaptive structuring in marine turtle populations that may significantly affect their capacity to respond to environmental change.",2012,"local adaptation; phenotypic plasticity; climate change; natal homing; population structure; evolutionary significant unit","Article","ISI"
"Local adaptation to salinity in the three-spined stickleback?","10.1111/jeb.12289","DeFaveri, J; Merila, J","Different lines of evidence suggest that the occurrence and extent of local adaptation in high gene flow marine environments - even in mobile and long-lived vertebrates with complex life cycles - may be more widespread than earlier thought. We conducted a common garden experiment to test for local adaptation to salinity in Baltic Sea sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Fish from three different native salinity regimes (high, mid and low) were subjected to three salinity treatments (high, mid and low) in a full-factorial experimental design. Irrespective of their origin, fish subjected to low (and mid) salinity treatments exhibited higher juvenile survival, grew to largest sizes and were in better condition than fish subjected to the high salinity treatment. However, a significant interaction between native and treatment salinities - resulting mainly from the poor performance of fish native to low salinity in the high salinity treatment - provided clear cut evidence for adaptation to local variation in salinity. Additional support for this inference was provided by the fact that the results concur with an earlier demonstration of significant differentiation in a number of genes with osmoregulatory functions across the same populations and that the population-specific responses to salinity treatments exceeded that to be expected by random genetic drift.",2014,"gasterosteus aculeatus; genetic differentiation; growth; local adaptation; mortality; salinity","Article","ISI"
"Environment and phenology shape local adaptation in thermal performance","10.1098/rspb.2021.0741","Villeneuve, AR; Komoroske, LM; Cheng, BS","Populations within species often exhibit variation in traits that reflect local adaptation and further shape existing adaptive potential for species to respond to climate change. However, our mechanistic understanding of how the environment shapes trait variation remains poor. Here, we used common garden experiments to quantify thermal performance in eight populations of the marine snail Urosalpinx cinerea across thermal gradients on the Atlantic and the Pacific coasts of North America. We then evaluated the relationship between thermal performance and environmental metrics derived from time-series data. Our results reveal a novel pattern of 'mixed' trait performance adaptation, where thermal optima were positively correlated with spawning temperature (cogradient variation), while maximum trait performance was negatively correlated with season length (countergradient variation). This counterintuitive pattern probably arises because of phenological shifts in the spawning season, whereby 'cold' populations delay spawning until later in the year when temperatures are warmer compared to 'warm' populations that spawn earlier in the year when temperatures are cooler. Our results show that variation in thermal performance can be shaped by multiple facets of the environment and are linked to organismal phenology and natural history. Understanding the impacts of climate change on organisms, therefore, requires the knowledge of how climate change will alter different aspects of the thermal environment.",2021,"countergradient variation; environmental drivers; latitudinal gradients; local adaptation; seasonality; thermal performance curve","Article","ISI"

We tested for genetic structure across the full circumpolar range of the white-chinned petrel (Procellaria aequinoctialis) to unravel the potential drivers of population differentiation and test alternative population differentiation hypotheses. Following range-wide comprehensive sampling, we applied genomic (genotyping-by-sequencing or GBS; 60,709 loci) and standard mitochondrial-marker approaches (cytochrome b and first domain of control region) to quantify genetic diversity within and among island populations, test for isolation by distance, and quantify the number of genetic clusters using neutral and outlier (non-neutral) loci. Our results supported the multi-region hypothesis, with a range of analyses showing clear three-region genetic population structure, split by ocean basin, within two evolutionary units. The most significant differentiation between these regions confirmed previous work distinguishing New Zealand and nominate subspecies. Although there was little evidence of structure within the island groups of the Indian or Atlantic oceans, a small set of highly-discriminatory outlier loci could assign petrels to ocean basin and potentially to island group, though the latter needs further verification.

The sea trout has considerable ecological and economic significance. It reproduces naturally in rivers flowing into, and is common in, the Baltic Sea. In Poland spawning aggregations occur in the Vistula River and the rivers of Pomerania. Two populations from the Vistula River (TW) and a Pomeranian river, the Slupia (TP) were mixed in the past by stocking. The main purpose of this study was an assessment of the applicability of the Atlantic salmon custom design Illumina iSelect SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) array containing 15,225 markers for identification of genetic diversity between sea trout populations. A diagnostic panel of 39 SNPs with a mean F-ST = 0.1298 was selected from a pool of 15,225. At each locus, minor allele frequency was higher than 0.01 and mean expected heterozygosity for TW and TP populations were 0.343 and 0.271 respectively. Individuals tested were clustered in one of two groups which corresponded to their origins where the TW population was genetically more homogenous (membership coefficients ranked from 88.8% to 98.6%) while the TP population was more diverse (membership coefficients ranked from 53.8% to 98.5%).

Despite its broad distribution along strong temperature and pH gradients and strong barriers to dispersal, the potential for local adaptation to climate change variables among kelp populations remains poorly understood. We assessed this potential by exposing giant kelp early life stages from genetically disparate populations in Chile and California to current and projected temperature and pH levels in common garden experiments. We observed high resistance at the haploid life stage to elevated temperatures with developmental failure appearing at the egg and sporophyte production stages among Chilean and high-latitude California populations, suggesting a greater vulnerability to climate- or ENSO-driven warming events. Additionally, populations that experience low pH events via strong upwelling, internal waves, or estuarine processes, produced more eggs per female under experimental low-pH conditions, which could increase fertilization success. These results enhance our ability to predict population extinctions and ecosystem range shifts under projected declines in ocean pH and increases in ocean temperature.",2020,"giant kelp; global warming; ocean acidification; local adaptation; reproduction; gametophyte","Article","ISI"

This is very useful, for example, in the field of conservation biology and evolutionary biology. Thanks to Next Generation Sequencing, genomic resources are growing exponentially, improving genome scan analyses in non-model species. Thousands of SNPs called using Reduced Representation Sequencing are increasingly used in genome scans. Besides, genome sequences are also becoming increasingly available, allowing better processing of short-read data, offering physical localization of variants, and improving haplotype reconstruction and data imputation. Ultimately, genome sequences are also becoming the raw material for selection inferences. Here, we discuss how the increasing availability of such genomic resources, notably genome sequences, influences the detection of signals of selection. Mainly, increasing data density and having the information of physical linkage data expand genome scans by (i) improving the overall quality of the data, (ii) helping the reconstruction of demographic history for the population studied to decrease false-positive rates and (iii) improving the statistical power of methods to detect the signal of selection. Of particular importance, the availability of a high-quality reference genome can improve the detection of the signal of selection by (i) allowing matching the potential candidate loci to linked coding regions under selection, (ii) rapidly moving the investigation to the gene and function and (iii) ensuring that the highly variable regions of the genomes that include functional genes are also investigated. For all those reasons, using reference genomes in genome scan analyses is highly recommended.",2016,"conservation biology; landscape genetics; landscape genomics; local adaptation; natural population; population genomics","Article","ISI"

Range expansion can lead to reduced genetic diversity and increased frequency of deleterious mutations that were rare in core populations, potentially limiting the ability for adaptation and persistence in novel environments. Successful expansions that overcome these founder effects and colonize new habitat have been attributed to multiple introductions from different sources, hybridization with native populations, or rapid adaptive evolution. Here, we investigate population genomic patterns of the reef-building coral Acropora hyacinthus along a latitudinal cline that includes a well-established range expansion front in Japan using 2b-RAD sequencing. A total of 184 coral samples were collected across seven sites spanning from similar to 24 degrees N to near its northern range front at similar to 33 degrees N. We uncover the presence of three cryptic lineages of A. hyacinthus, which occupy discrete reefs within this region. Only one lineage is present along the expansion front and we find evidence for its historical occupation of marginal habitats. Within this lineage we also find evidence of bottleneck pressures associated with expansion events including higher clonality, increased linkage disequilibrium, and lower genetic diversity in range edge populations compared to core populations. Asymmetric migration between populations was also detected with lower migration from edge sites. Lastly, we describe genomic signatures of local adaptation potentially attributed to lower winter temperatures experienced at the more recently expanded northern populations. 'together these data illuminate the genomic consequences of range expansion in a coral and highlight how adaptation to discrete environments along expansion fronts may facilitate further range expansion in this temperate coral lineage.",2022,"range expansion; coral; 2brad-seq; cryptic lineage; adaptation; population genomics","Article","ISI"
"Telemetry and genetics reveal asymmetric dispersal of a lake-feeding salmonid between inflow and outflow spawning streams at a microgeographic scale","10.1002/ece3.5937","Finlay, R; Poole, R; Coughlan, J; Phillips, KP; Prodohl, P; Cotter, D; McGinnity, P; Reed, TE","The degree of natal philopatry relative to natal dispersal in animal populations has important demographic and genetic consequences and often varies substantially within species. In salmonid fishes, lakes have been shown to have a strong influence on dispersal and gene flow within catchments; for example, populations spawning in inflow streams are often reproductively isolated and genetically distinct from those spawning in relatively distant outflow streams. Less is known, however, regarding the level of philopatry and genetic differentiation occurring at microgeographic scales, for example, where inflow and outflow streams are separated by very small expanses of lake habitat. Here, we investigated the interplay between genetic differentiation and fine-scale spawning movements of brown trout between their lake-feeding habitat and two spawning streams (one inflow, one outflow, separated by <100 m of lake habitat). Most (69.2%) of the lake-tagged trout subsequently detected during the spawning period were recorded in just one of the two streams, consistent with natal fidelity, while the remainder were detected in both streams, creating an opportunity for these individuals to spawn in both natal and non-natal streams. The latter behavior was supported by genetic sibship analysis, which revealed several half-sibling dyads containing one individual that was sampled as a fry in the outflow and another that was sampled as fry in the inflow. Genetic clustering analyses in conjunction with telemetry data suggested that asymmetrical dispersal patterns were occurring, with natal fidelity being more common among individuals originating from the outflow than the inflow stream. This was corroborated by Bayesian analysis of gene flow, which indicated significantly higher rates of gene flow from the inflow into the outflow than vice versa. Collectively, these results reveal how a combination of telemetry and genetics can identify distinct reproductive behaviors and associated asymmetries in natal dispersal that produce subtle, but nonetheless biologically relevant, population structuring at microgeographic scales.",2020,"dispersal; lake; local adaptation; philopatry; sympatric populations; telemetry","Article","ISI"

However, how these processes are in synteny to trait evolution in species of open and xeric areas is poorly studied. Here, we investigate the spatial and temporal dimensions of evolution and candidate traits associated with biome shifts in xeric vegetation, focusing on the family Cactaceae. Location Xeric and open areas of South America. Taxon Genus Cereus Mill. (Cactaceae, Cereeae). Methods We applied biogeographical reconstructions on a time-calibrated phylogeny inferred from multilocus data (ddRAD-Seq) using Bayesian analyses on BEAST2, species distribution modelling in Maxent, the reconstruction of biome affinities and niche shift analyses based on abiotic traits (climate and soil) using Mk-model in BioGeoBEARS, and phenotypic trait-based analysis in Mesquite. Results The Cerrado domain is the ancestral area of Cereus, with most diversification events occurring in a time of intense orogenesis, climatic changes, and marine regressions within the last 5 Mya. Events of biome transition from the seasonally dry tropical forest (SDTF) were also associated with trait and niche shifts. Main conclusions The diversification of the xerophyte genus Cereus is associated with the climatic and geomorphological instabilities of the Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs. The Cerrado domain states an important region of dispersal for the genus. Some geographical range movements involved biome shifts associated with niche evolution while others were restricted to a simple biogeographical transition without niche change. Particular clades that experienced biome shifts displayed some phenotypic state changes, suggesting a role of biotic traits for environment transition. The results observed in Cereus may be a biogeographical pattern that should be tested with other cactus species, such as Pilosocereus spp., or species of xeric habitats, such as Annonaceae and Vochysiaceae.",2021,"biogeography; biome transition; niche shifts; plio-pleistocene; rad-seq; sdtf; trait shift","Article","ISI"

A series of five uplifted marine terraces along the northern coast of California represents one such system where morphologically distinct populations of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) are distributed across sharp soil gradients ranging from fertile soils near the coast to podzolic soils ca. 5 km inland. Methods: A total of 92 trees was sampled across four coastal marine terraces (N = 10-46 trees/terrace) located in Mendocino County, California and sequenced for a set of 24 candidate genes for growth and responses to various soil chemistry variables. Statistical analyses relying on patterns of nucleotide diversity were employed to identify genes whose diversity patterns were inconsistent with three null models. Key results: Most genes displayed patterns of nucleotide diversity that were consistent with null models (N = 19) or with the presence of paralogs (N = 3). Two genes, however, were exceptional: an aluminum responsive ABC-transporter with F-ST = 0.664 and an inorganic phosphate transporter characterized by divergent haplotypes segregating at intermediate frequencies in most populations. Conclusions: Spatially variable natural selection along gradients of aluminum and phosphate ion concentrations likely accounted for both outliers.

Although adults grow relatively slowly, juveniles exhibit low feed conversion ratios and can reach market size in 1-2 years, making P. oxygeneios a strong candidate for aquaculture. However, they can take over 5 years to reach sexual maturity in captivity and are not externally sexually dimorphic, complicating many aspects of broodstock management. Understanding the sex determination system of P. oxygeneios and developing accurate assays to assign genetic sex will contribute significantly towards its full-scale commercialisation. Results: DNA from parents and sexed offspring (n = 57) from a single family of captive bred P. oxygeneios was used as a template for double digestion Restriction-site Associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing. Two libraries were constructed using SbfI - SphI and SbfI - NcoI restriction enzyme combinations, respectively. Two runs on an Illumina MiSeq platform generated 70,266,464 raw reads, identifying 19,669 RAD loci. A combined sex linkage map (1367 cM) was constructed based on 1575 Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) markers that resolved into 35 linkage groups. Sex-specific linkage maps were of similar size (1132 and 1168 cM for male and female maps respectively). A single major sex-determining locus, found to be heterogametic in males, was mapped to linkage group 14. Several markers were found to be in strong linkage disequilibrium with the sex-determining locus. Allele-specific PCR assays were developed for two of these markers, SphI6331 and SphI8298, and demonstrated to accurately differentiate sex in progeny within the same pedigree. Comparative genomic analyses indicated that many of the linkage groups within the P. oxygeneios map share a relatively high degree of homology with those published for the European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax). Conclusion: P. oxygeneios has an XX/XY sex determination system. Evaluation of allele-specific PCR assays, based on the two SNP markers most closely associated with phenotypic sex, indicates that a simple molecular assay for sexing P. oxygeneios should be readily attainable. The high degree of synteny observed with D. labrax should aid further molecular genetic study and exploitation of hapuku as a food fish.",2016,"hapuku; sex chromosome; mariculture; rad-seq; new zealand groper","Article","ISI"

Risk management requires genetic information to establish appropriate management units and infer introduction and dispersal routes. We investigated one of the most successful marine invaders, the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi, and used genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) to explore the spatial population structure in its nonindigenous range in the North Sea. We analyzed 140 specimens collected in different environments, including coastal and estuarine areas, and ports along the coast. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were called in approximately 40 k GBS loci. Population structure based on the neutral SNP panel was significant (F-ST .02; p < .01), and a distinct genetic cluster was identified in a port along the Belgian coast (Ostend port; pairwise F-ST .02-.04; p < .01). Remarkably, no population structure was detected between geographically distant regions in the North Sea (the Southern part of the North Sea vs. the Kattegat/Skagerrak region), which indicates substantial gene flow at this geographical scale and recent population expansion of nonindigenous M. leidyi. Additionally, seven specimens collected at one location in the indigenous range (Chesapeake Bay, USA) were highly differentiated from the North Sea populations (pairwise F-ST .36-.39; p < .01).

Coralline algae are ecosystem engineers that play significant functional roles in oceans worldwide and are considered vulnerable to ocean acidification. Using different stages of coralline algae, we tested the hypothesis that populations living in environments with higher environmental variability and exposed to higher levels of pCO(2) would be less affected by high pCO(2) than populations from a more stable environment experiencing lower levels of pCO(2). Our results show that spores are less sensitive to elevated pCO(2) than adults. Spore growth and mortality were not affected by pCO(2) level; however, elevated pCO(2) negatively impacted the physiology and growth rates of adults, with stronger effects in populations that experienced both lower levels of pCO(2) and lower variability in carbonate chemistry, suggesting local adaptation. Differences in physiological plasticity and the potential for adaptation could have important implications for the ecological and evolutionary responses of coralline algae to future environmental changes.",2016,"california; life-history stages; local adaptation; ocean acidification; photosynthesis; physiological plasticity; spore; upwelling","Article","ISI"

Due to long coastal migrations that span multiple jurisdictions, a detailed understanding of population genomics is required to untangle demographic patterns, understand local adaptation, and characterize population movements. This study used 1,256 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci to investigate genetic structure of 477 Striped Bass sampled from 15 locations spanning the North American Atlantic coast from the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada, to the Cape Fear River, United States. We found striking differences in neutral divergence among Canadian sites, which were isolated from each other and US populations, compared with US populations that were much less isolated. Our SNP dataset was able to assign 99% of Striped Bass back to six reporting groups, a 39% improvement over previous genetic markers. Using this method, we found (a) evidence of admixture within Saint John River, indicating that migrants from the United States and from Shubenacadie River occasionally spawn in the Saint John River; (b) Striped Bass collected in the Mira River, Cape Breton, Canada, were found to be of both Miramichi River and US origin; (c) juveniles in the newly restored Kennebec River population had small and nonsignificant differences from the Hudson River; and (d) tributaries within the Chesapeake Bay showed a mixture of homogeny and small differences among each other.

As a first step towards testing the hypothesis that compromised smoltification is implicated, we investigated whether genetic differences in hypo-osmoregulatory ability exist between two iBoF stocks (Stewiacke and Gaspereau) and two other Nova Scotia stocks (Sackville and Medway), all reared under the same conditions from the egg stage. In addition, LaHave and Saint John stocks were included, though their rearing history differed from the other four stocks. Plasma osmolality and muscle water content following biweekly 96 h 35 ppt salinity challenge tests (constant 6 degrees C), was significantly affected by the interaction between genotype and challenge test date. iBoF Stewiacke stock exhibited relatively poor hypo-osmoregulatory ability during April and early May compared to the other five stocks, indicating a later completion of smolting. By comparison, the iBoF Gaspereau stock exhibited similar temporal changes in hypo-osmoregulatory ability to the other stocks. From late May to early July, all stocks exhibited similarly good hypo-osmoregulatory ability. This unusually long smolt window was associated with rearing at 6 degrees C in well water.

"Tolerance Patterns and Transcriptomic Response to Extreme and Fluctuating Salinities across Populations of the Intertidal Copepod Tigriopus californicus","10.1086/712031","Lee, J; Phillips, MC; Lobo, M; Willett, CS","Populations that tolerate extreme environmental conditions with frequent fluctuations can give valuable insights into physiological limits and adaptation. In some estuarine and marine ecosystems, organisms must adapt to extreme and fluctuating salinities, but not much is known about how varying salinities impact local adaptation across a wide geographic range. We used eight geographically and genetically divergent populations of the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus to test whether northern populations have greater tolerance to low salinity stresses, as they experience greater precipitation and less evaporation. We used a common-garden experiment approach and exposed all populations to acute low (1 and 3 ppt) and high (110 and 130 ppt) salinities for 24 h and to a fluctuation between baseline salinity and moderate low (7 ppt) and high (80 ppt) salinities for over 49 h. We also performed RNA sequencing at several time points during the fluctuation between baseline and salinity of 7 ppt to understand the molecular basis of divergence between two populations with differing physiological responses. We present these novel findings: (1) acute low salinity conditions caused more deaths than high salinity; (2) molecular processes that elevate proline levels increased in salinity of 7 ppt, which contrasts with other physiological studies in T. californicus that mainly associated accumulation of proline with hyperosmotic stress; and (3) tolerance to a salinity fluctuation did not follow a latitudinal trend but was instead governed by a complex interplay of factors, including population and duration of salinity stress. This highlights the importance of including a wider variety of environmental conditions in empirical studies to understand local adaptation.",2021,"acute salinity; fluctuating environment; intertidal; invertebrate; local adaptation; proline regulation; rna sequencing (rna-seq); low salinity tolerance","Article","ISI"

Targeted gene analyses and more recently genome-wide studies have challenged such view, suggesting that adaptive divergence might occur even when neutral markers provide genetic homogeneity across populations. Here, 381 SNPs located in transcribed regions were used to assess large- and fine-scale population structure in the European hake (Merluccius merluccius), a widely distributed demersal species of high priority for the European fishery. Analysis of 850 individuals from 19 locations across the entire distribution range showed evidence for several outlier loci, with significantly higher resolving power. While 299 putatively neutral SNPs confirmed the genetic break between basins (F-CT = 0.016) and weak differentiation within basins, outlier loci revealed a dramatic divergence between Atlantic and Mediterranean populations (F-CT range 0.275-0.705) and fine-scale significant population structure. Outlier loci separated North Sea and Northern Portugal populations from all other Atlantic samples and revealed a strong differentiation among Western, Central and Eastern Mediterranean geographical samples. Significant correlation of allele frequencies at outlier loci with sea-water surface temperature and salinity supported the hypothesis that populations might be adapted to local conditions. Such evidence highlights the importance of integrating information from neutral and adaptive evolutionary patterns towards a better assessment of genetic diversity.

Here, we report a population genetic study of the deep-sea mussel Bathymodiolus platifrons (Bivalvia: Mytilidae) widely distributed in chemosynthesis-based ecosystems in the Northwest Pacific. Three mitochondrial genes (i.e., atp6, cox1, and nad4) and 6,398 genomewide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained from 110 individuals from four hydrothermal vents and two methane seeps. When using the three mitochondrial genes, nearly no genetic differentiation was detected for B. platifrons in the Northwest Pacific. Nevertheless, when using SNP datasets, all individuals in the South China Sea (SCS) and three individuals in Sagami Bay (SB) together formed one genetic cluster that was distinct from the remaining individuals. Such genetic divergence indicated a genetic barrier to gene flow between the SCS and the open Northwest Pacific, resulting in the co-occurrence of two cryptic semi-isolated lineages. When using 125 outlier SNPs identified focusing on individuals in the Okinawa Trough (OT) and SB, a minor genetic subdivision was detected between individuals in the southern OT (S-OT) and those in the middle OT (M-OT) and SB. This result indicated that, although under the influence of the Kuroshio Current and the North Pacific Intermediate Water, subtle geographic barriers may exist between the S-OT and the M-OT. Introgression analyses based on these outlier SNPs revealed that Hatoma Knoll in the S-OT represents a possible contact zone for individuals in the OT-SB region. Furthermore, migration dynamic analyses uncovered stronger gene flow from Dai-yon Yonaguni Knoll in the S-OT to the other local populations, compared to the reverse directions. Taken together, the present study offered novel perspectives on the genetic connectivity of B. platifrons mussels, revealing the potential interaction of ocean currents and geographic barriers with adaption and reproductive isolation in shaping their migration patterns and genetic differentiation in the Northwest Pacific.",2018,"bathymodiolus; deep-sea; genetic structure; introgression; migration patterns; mitochondrial genes; population connectivity; rad-seq","Article","ISI"

Microsporidian genomes have undergone extreme reductive evolution but there are major differences in genome size and structure within the group: some are prokaryote-like in size and organisation (<3 Mb of gene-dense sequence) while others have more typically eukaryotic genome architectures. To gain fine-scale, population-level insight into the evolutionary dynamics of these tiny eukaryotic genomes, we performed the broadest microsporidian population genomic study to date, sequencing geographically isolated strains of Spraguea, a marine microsporidian infecting goosefish worldwide. Our analysis revealed that population structure across the Atlantic Ocean is associated with a conserved difference in ploidy, with American and Canadian isolates sharing an ancestral whole genome duplication that was followed by widespread pseudogenisation and sorting-out of paralogue pairs. While past analyses have suggested de novo gene formation ofmicrosporidian-specific genes, we found evidence for the origin of new genes from noncoding sequence since the divergence of these populations. Some of these genes experience selective constraint, suggesting the evolution of new functions and local host adaptation. Combining our data with published microsporidian genomes, we show that nucleotide composition across the phylum is shaped by a mutational bias favoring A and T nucleotides, which is opposed by an evolutionary force favoring an increase in genomic GC content. This study reveals ongoing dramatic reorganization of genome structure and the evolution of new gene functions in modern microsporidians despite extensive genomic streamlining in their common ancestor.",2016,"microsporidia; reductive genome evolution; gene birth; population genomics","Article","ISI"

Where these phenotypes contribute to reproductive isolation, they further support a role for divergent, habitat-associated selection in speciation. However, the observation of pairs of divergent ecotypes currently occupying contrasting habitats in distinct geographical regions is not sufficient to infer parallel origins. Here we show striking parallel phenotypic divergence between populations of the rocky-shore gastropod, Littorina saxatilis, occupying contrasting habitats exposed to either wave action or crab predation. This divergence is associated with barriers to gene exchange but, nevertheless, genetic variation is more strongly structured by geography than by ecotype. Using approximate Bayesian analysis of sequence data and amplified fragment length polymorphism markers, we show that the ecotypes are likely to have arisen in the face of continuous gene flow and that the demographic separation of ecotypes has occurred in parallel at both regional and local scales. Parameter estimates suggest a long delay between colonization of a locality and ecotype formation, perhaps because the postglacial spread of crab populations was slower than the spread of snails. Adaptive differentiation may not be fully genetically independent despite being demographically parallel.

LocationSubtropical coastal (Solitary Islands, Flinders Reef) and offshore (Lord Howe Island, Middleton Reef, Elizabeth Reef) eastern Australia and the southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). MethodsCoral genetic diversity and identity were assessed by sequence analysis of a mitochondrial (mtDNA) region (ORF), a PCR-based mtDNA screening assay, and microsatellite loci. The identity of the Symbiodinium was determined using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of nuclear rDNA ITS2. ResultsThe mitochondrial haplotype Pocillopora damicornis Type was present at all locations: 100% on the GBR and Flinders Reef, 85% and 87% respectively at Middleton Reef and Elizabeth Reef, 25% at Lord Howe Island and 5% at the Solitary Islands.

"Assessing the effect of genetic diversity on the early establishment of the threatened seagrass Posidonia australis using a reciprocal-transplant experiment","10.1111/rec.12595","Evans, SM; Sinclair, EA; Poore, AGB; Bain, KF; Verges, A","Two common goals for restoration are rapid plant establishment and long-term plant persistence. The success of transplanted populations may be jeopardized if the donor transplants are not genetically diverse, and/or poorly matched to their new environment. Here, we test the effects of local adaptation and plot-level genetic diversity on the early establishment phase of a threatened seagrass species, Posidonia australis, by performing a reciprocal transplant experiment across two genetically and geographically distinct populations in southeastern Australia. Posidonia australis is a long-lived, slow-growing species that has no seed bank, and the successful transplantation of live shoots and seedlings is the only available restoration method. Our results show a strong effect of local adaptation and genetic diversity on P. australis survivorship and performance over the first 6months following transplantation. High-genetic diversity plots displayed higher survival rates and exhibited reduced productivity and increased carbohydrate reserves within the rhizome. This suggests that high-diversity plots included shoots that were conserving energy stores by actively reducing growth rates during the early stages of transplantation. The lowest diversity plots exhibited high leaf and root productivity and corresponding low carbohydrate reserves. This may be a sign of stress in the low-diversity transplants, potentially explaining the very low survival rate. We suggest that future restoration efforts source donor transplants from multiple local sources to ensure both local adaptation and sufficient genetic diversity to increase the likelihood of early establishment success.",2018,"carbohydrate storage; home-site advantage; local adaptation; microsatellite dna; restoration; survival","Article","ISI"

Understanding the impacts that temperature can have on organismal function can lead to insights into the nature of adaptive variation in thermotolerance. This approach has been widely used to understand the spatial distribution of related species within the context of evolutionary time scales. Here, we measured the upper lethal thermal threshold of the invasive European green crab, Carcinus maenas (Linnaeus, 1758), sampled from two populations from the southern and northern limits of its recipient range on the west coast of North America: Sea Drift Lagoon, Stinson Beach, California (CA), and Pipestem Inlet, Vancouver Island, British Columbia (BC). These two populations differ in their natural thermal regimes: sea surface temperatures near the southern, CA population range from similar to 23 degrees C to similar to 11 degrees C while temperatures near the northern population in BC range from similar to 14 degrees C to similar to 6 degrees C during summer and winter, respectively. We demonstrate that after laboratory acclimation to 6 degrees C or 23 degrees C, the CA group had a significantly higher mean critical thermal maximum (CTmax) than its northern counterpart, in both acclimation groups. After acclimation to 6 degrees C, the CA group displayed a mean CTmax of 34.7 degrees C whereas the mean CTmax of the BC group was 31.7 degrees C. In the 23 degrees C acclimation groups, mean CTmax was 36.2 degrees C in the CA population and 35.5 degrees C in the BC one. To establish whether these differences in whole-organism thermotolerance were manifested at the molecular scale, levels of the inducible stress protein, heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), were quantified in the chelae of the crabs used in the CTmax assay, at each individual's time-of-death. In the 6 degrees C acclimation comparison, the CA population had significantly greater Hsp70 levels than the BC population. No difference in Hsp70 levels was observed between the 23 degrees C acclimation groups. In a separate experiment, collection site-specific differences were found in the thermal threshold for induction of Hsp70 in isolated chelae tissue. The two populations also differed morphologically. Significant differences in carapace widths (ON) were measured for adult male and female green crabs from the two populations, sampled during 2008-2009. Observable divergences in both morphology and in physiological responses to heat stress have occurred within the relatively recent time span (similar to 20 years) of the invasion of the European green crab on the west coast of North America and it is possible that a large, northern cold-water phenotype may have already arisen.

"The population genomics of repeated freshwater colonizations by Gulf pipefish","10.1111/mec.15841","Flanagan, SP; Rose, E; Jones, AG","How organisms adapt to the novel challenges imposed by the colonization of a new habitat has long been a central question in evolutionary biology. When multiple populations of the same species independently adapt to similar environmental challenges, the question becomes whether the populations have arrived at their adaptations through the same genetic mechanisms. In recent years, genetic techniques have been used to tackle these questions by investigating the genome-level changes underlying local adaptation. Here, we present a genomic analysis of colonization of freshwater habitats by a primarily marine fish, the Gulf pipefish (Syngnathus scovelli). We sample pipefish from four geographically distinct freshwater locations and use double-digest restriction site associated DNA sequencing to compare them to 12 previously studied saltwater populations. The two most geographically distant and isolated freshwater populations are the most genetically distinct, although demographic analysis suggests that these populations are experiencing ongoing migration with their saltwater neighbours. Additionally, outlier regions were found genome-wide, showing parallelism across ecotype pairs. We conclude that these multiple freshwater colonizations involve similar genomic regions, despite the large geographical distances and different underlying mechanisms. These similar patterns are probably facilitated by the interacting effects of intrinsic barriers, gene flow among populations and ecological selection in the Gulf pipefish.",2021,"ecological speciation; isolation by distance; isolation by ecology; population genomics; radseq; syngnathus scovelli","Article","ISI"

Although immigrant inviability is a well-established concept, the fact that immigrants also need to be able to effectively reproduce in foreign environments has not been fully appreciated in the study of adaptive divergence and speciation. Fertilization and reproduction are sensitive life-history stages that could be detrimentally affected for immigrants in non-native habitats. We propose that immigrant reproductive dysfunction is a hitherto overlooked aspect of reproductive isolation caused by natural selection on immigrants. This idea is supported by results from experiments on an externally fertilizing fish (sand goby, Pomatoschistus minutus). Growth and condition of adults were not affected by non-native salinity whereas males spawning as immigrants had lower sperm motility and hatching success than residents. We interpret these results as evidence for local adaptation or acclimation of sperm, and possibly also components of paternal care. The resulting loss in fitness, which we call immigrant reproductive dysfunction, has the potential to reduce gene flow between populations with locally adapted reproduction, and it may play a role in species distributions and speciation.",2017,"ecological speciation; immigrant inviability; immigrant reproductive dysfunction; local adaptation; multifarious selection; transporter hypothesis","Article","ISI"
"Collective behavior as a driver of critical transitions in migratory populations","10.1186/s40462-016-0083-8","Berdahl, A; van Leeuwen, A; Levin, SA; Torney, CJ","Background: Mass migrations are among the most striking examples of animal movement in the natural world. Such migrations are major drivers of ecosystem processes and strongly influence the survival and fecundity of individuals. For migratory animals, a formidable challenge is to find their way over long distances and through complex, dynamic environments. However, recent theoretical and empirical work suggests that by traveling in groups, individuals are able to overcome these challenges and increase their ability to navigate. Here we use models to explore the implications of collective navigation on migratory, and population, dynamics, for both breeding migrations (to-and-fro migrations between distinct, fixed, end-points) and feeding migrations (loop migrations that track favorable conditions). Results: We show that while collective navigation does improve a population's ability to migrate accurately, it can lead to Allee effects, causing the sudden collapse of populations if numbers fall below a critical threshold. In some scenarios, hysteresis prevents the migration from recovering even after the cause of the collapse has been removed. In collectively navigating populations that are locally adapted to specific breeding sites, a slight increase in mortality can cause a collapse of genetic population structure, rather than population size, making it more difficult to detect and prevent. Conclusions: Despite the large interest in collective behavior and its ubiquity in many migratory species, there is a notable lack of studies considering the implications of social navigation on the ecological dynamics of migratory species. Here we highlight the potential for a previously overlooked Allee effect in socially migrating species that may be important for conservation and management of such species.",2016,"collective navigation; migration; population collapse; dispersal; local adaptation; anadromous fish; migratory ungulates; migratory birds; migratory marine fish","Article","ISI"

We analyzed 13 populations from five coastal habitats, using linear and geometric morphometry, and tested the correlation of body shape variation with environmental variables to understand which environmental factors may influence body shape and size variation. Jenynsia lineata showed differences in body shape and size among populations, and these differences are specific to each sex.

For the test of microsatellite development, we calculated the number of alleles (Na), observed heterozygosities (Ho), expected heterozygosities (He) and exact tests for deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). Twelve polymorphic loci were used to access the genetic diversity and population structure of four B. virescens populations.ResultsIn this study, 50,729 microsatellites of B. virescens were detected. Twenty-two polymorphic microsatellite loci were developed for B. virescens. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 6 to 15, and expected heterozygosities varied from 0. 567 to 0.911. All the PIC values of the 22 loci were greater than 0.5, indicating that these markers were highly informative for further genetic analysis. Twelve loci were selected to analyze genetic diversity and population structure of four B. virescens populations collected from different geographical regions along the southern coast of China.

Such plasticity can permit local adaptation but it can also be constrained by physiological and behavioral mechanisms. Here, we explore how different temperature regimes along a latitudinal gradient spanning the natural range of a species of fiddler crab may affect the ability of crabs to change color rapidly in response to acute changes of temperature. Uca pugilator populations from New York (NY), North Carolina (NC) and Florida (FL) were exposed in air to 5 degrees C and 35 degrees C and carapace shade intensity (from dark to light color) and contrast was recorded. In general, individuals darkened when exposed to cold conditions, and lightened when exposed to warm conditions. Males from different populations differed in the magnitude of response to temperature, but had similar directional changes in shade (dark under cold conditions and light under warm conditions) suggesting differences among populations in the ability to change color. Females showed similar directional changes but there were no differences among populations. Differential responses of crabs to temperature suggest that crabs have local physiological adaptations and can acclimate quickly to withstand fluctuating or extreme temperatures.

Interestingly, significant correlation was detected between methylation levels and the two environmental factors at some CpGs in these two genes. When the data of all CpGs was subjected to principal component analysis, individuals were assigned back to their population orgins.

These listings relied heavily on evidence from other species that these populations were 'discrete' taxonomic units because little information was available for these species in PS. To fill this data gap, we collaborated with recreational fishing communities in PS to collect tissue samples and used population genetics analyses to determine whether samples from PS were genetically differentiated from samples collected from the outer coasts of the U.S. and Canada. Multiple analyses using restriction-site associated DNA sequencing data showed that yelloweye rockfish in PS and British Columbia, Canada were genetically different from coastal populations, while canary rockfish showed no genetic differentiation. These results support hypotheses that the genetic connectivity of rockfish populations is based on interactions between life-history characteristics and oceanographic conditions. These data also support the ESA designation status and the expansion of protected geographical boundaries for yelloweye rockfish but also suggest canary rockfish in PS are not a 'discrete' population and may not meet the first criterion of the ESA, as initially assumed. Collaboration among agencies and fishing communities, and cost-efficient genetic analyses provided a framework for collecting and analyzing data essential to the conservation and management of threatened and endangered species.",2018,"endangered species act; population connectivity; fishing; local ecological knowledge; population genetics; rad-seq","Article","ISI"

We analyzed the pattern of genetic and morphometric variation of the razor clam Ensis macha along its entire geographic distribution. This species is one of the most important shellfish resources of South America. To uncover the genetic variation across this species, we used sequences of the COI mitochondrial gene and of 856 nuclear orthologs. To describe morphological variation in the shape of the shell, we used elliptic Fourier analysis followed by multivariate statistics. Two main genetic lineages were found, designated as Northern and Southern clades. This genetic distinction is concordant with a biogeographic transition along the Pacific coast of Southern South America, which is also known for other taxa. Based on the genetic distance between the two lineages, each lineage can be considered an incipient species. Morphological approaches revealed similar results, though there was no strict concordance between the morphometric and the genetic results. Geological history and ecological processes could both be responsible for the variation across the range of E. macha. In particular, fragmentation and isolation between populations may have favored genetic diversification, while the environment may have molded the variation shell shape. Lastly, our results have important implications for fisheries management, to preserve biological diversity of the world's southernmost razor clam species.",2020,"genetic analysis; elliptic fourier analysis; patagonia; phylogeography; phenotypic plasticity; local adaptation","Article","ISI"
"A High Incidence of Selection on Physiologically Important Genes in the Three-Spined Stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus","10.1093/molbev/msq181","Shimada, Y; Shikano, T; Merila, J","Genome scan approaches to detect footprints of directional selection in the genomes of wild animal and plant populations have become popular tools to study local adaptation and speciation at the molecular level. Most studies thus far have used random molecular markers and found footprints of directional selection at, on average, 5% (range: 1-15%) of the examined loci. We focused on physiologically important genes that exhibit transcriptional responses to specific environmental or developmental conditions and assessed if these genes have been subject to directional selection and are responsible for local adaptation in the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Using microsatellite markers located within or closely linked to (< 6 kb) target genes, we investigated footprints of directional selection for 157 genes with known physiological functions in three marine and six freshwater populations. A high incidence (16.6%) of footprints of directional selection for these genes was revealed by four different outlier tests. In a subset of four populations screened with both physiologically important and random genes, footprints of directional selection were more frequent in physiologically important genes (13.4%) as compared with random genes (2.4%). In general, our findings indicate strong selective pressures on physiologically important genes, suggesting that these genes have significant functions in evolutionary adaptation to environmental heterogeneity.",2011,"genome scan; local adaptation; natural selection; microsatellites; three-spined stickleback; gasterosteus aculeatus","Article","ISI"

This uniquely dense coat led to the near-extinction of sea otters during the 18th-20th century fur trade and an extreme population bottleneck. We used the de novo genome of the southern sea otter (E. l. nereis) to reconstruct its evolutionary history, identify genes influencing aquatic adaptation, and detect signals of population bottlenecks. We compared the genome of the southern sea otter with the tropical freshwater-living giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis) to assess common and divergent genomic trends between otter species, and with the closely related northern sea otter (E. l. kenyoni) to uncover population-level trends. We found signals of positive selection in genes related to aquatic adaptations, particularly limb development and polygenic selection on genes related to hair follicle development. We found extensive pseudogenization of olfactory receptor genes in both the sea otter and giant otter lineages, consistent with patterns of sensory gene loss in other aquatic mammals. At the population level, the southern sea otter and the northern sea otter showed extremely low genomic diversity, signals of recent inbreeding, and demographic histories marked by population declines. These declines may predate the fur trade and appear to have resulted in an increase in putatively deleterious variants that could impact the future recovery of the sea otter.",2019,"sea otter; giant otter; genomics; population genetics; adaptation; olfaction; demography; deleterious variation; pseudogenes","Article","ISI"
"Age-structured genetic analysis reveals temporal and geographic variation within and between two cryptic rockfish species","10.3354/meps09329","Burford, MO; Carr, MH; Bernardi, G","The spatial patterns of genetic structure among juveniles of long-lived species can reveal the extent of interannual and geographic variation in realized larval dispersal as well as the processes that determine ecologically relevant patterns of population connectivity. However, few studies examine this temporal and spatial variation over large portions of a species' geographic range or between cryptic species that overlap in their range. Despite the potential for long-distance dispersal in blue rockfish Sebastes mystinus, a previous study of adults revealed two geographically distinct, cryptic species. To determine year-to-year variation in the patterns of spatial connectivity and to elucidate the potential ecological mechanisms involved in shaping new year-classes and maintaining cryptic species, we sampled juveniles within California, USA, where both cryptic species coexist. Using microsatellite markers, we found geographic and temporal variation in the number of individuals from these distinct cryptic species within 2 new year-classes of juvenile S. mystinus. We also found differences in the geographic patterns of genetic structure of the 2 cryptic species. Whereas one species exhibited little or no spatial genetic structure across the study region, the other exhibited a complex geographic pattern of genetic structure, with little or no genetic structure among regions, but small-scale structure within a region. The results of this study demonstrate that the spatial scales and patterns of realized dispersal of pelagic larvae vary geographically, interannually, and between closely related species with similar life-history strategies. Therefore, estimates of dispersal based on larval duration and patterns of adult structure need to be interpreted cautiously.",2011,"cryptic species; range expansion; ecological genetics; local adaptation; sebastes spp.","Article","ISI"

"The 'last mile' for climate data supporting local adaptation","10.1017/sus.2021.12","Celliers, L; Costa, MM; Williams, DS; Rosendo, S","Non-technical summary The 'last mile' is a transportation planning term that describes the movement of people and goods from a transportation hub to a final destination; a local place such as a home or a shop. This is the final step of the logistics process that unites the product with its new owner. We present and explain challenges of science-guided adaptation at the local level, and how this is an equivalent 'last mile' challenge for climate adaptation. Technical summary The 'last mile' issue, a term used in transportation planning, describes the movement of people and goods from a transportation hub to a final destination, a local place such as a home or a shop. This is the critical final step of the logistics process that unites the product with its new owner, and the point of the value chain. This analogy aptly describes the last steps between presenting scientific evidence of climate change to decision-makers for use in local adaptation and planning. Climate change data (observational and model simulation data e.g. climate change projections and predictions) remain under-utilised, especially by local institutions and actors for which adaptation is a priority. The assumptions and assertions of the classical data-information-knowledge-wisdom are challenged, and a derivative form of the information hierarchy is proposed. Elements of the classical information hierarchy are offset by four balancing elements of access (to data); usability (of information); governance (of knowledge) and politics (of wisdom). These balancing elements and their relatedness coincide with newer models of innovation relating to the interaction between different stakeholders across the different levels of governance, the inclusion of stakeholder expectations, transparency and accountability.

Insects have evolved a diverse range of mechanisms to reduce the efficacy of the commonly used classes of insecticides, and finding the genetic basis of resistance is a major aid to management. In a previously unstudied population, we performed an F-2 resistance mapping cross for the common bed bug, Cimex lectularius, for which insecticide resistance is increasingly widespread. Using 334 SNP markers obtained through RAD-sequencing, we constructed the first linkage map for the species, consisting of 14 putative linkage groups (LG), with a length of 407 cM and an average marker spacing of 1.3 cM. The linkage map was used to reassemble the recently published reference genome, facilitating refinement and validation of the current genome assembly. We detected a major QTL on LG12 associated with insecticide resistance, occurring in close proximity (1.2 Mb) to a carboxylesterase encoding candidate gene for pyrethroid resistance. This provides another example of this candidate gene playing a major role in determining survival in a bed bug population following pesticide resistance evolution. The recent availability of the bed bug genome, complete with a full list of potential candidate genes related to insecticide resistance, in addition to the linkage map generated here, provides an excellent resource for future research on the development and spread of insecticide resistance in this resurging pest species.",2016,"ectoparasite; household pest; insecticide; rad-seq","Article","ISI"
"Next-generation transcriptome profiling reveals insights into genetic factors contributing to growth differences and temperature adaptation in Australian populations of barramundi (Lates calcarifer)","10.1016/j.margen.2013.07.002","Newton, JR; Zenger, KR; Jerry, DR","Identification of genetically-regulated adaptation in fish is a precursor to understanding how populations will respond to future climate induced stressors like temperature. Australian populations of barramundi (Lates calcarifer) show strong evidence of local adaptation to temperature. However, the phenotypic consequences of this adaptation are unknown and the genetic mechanisms underlying this response are poorly understood. In the current study, two populations of barramundi from temperature extremes of the species Australian distribution were communally reared at cool (22 degrees C), control (28 degrees C) and hot (36 degrees C) water temperatures for 3.5 months. Southern populations of barramundi originating from a cooler environment grew significantly faster at 22 degrees C than northern populations of warm adapted barramundi. However, no difference in population growth was present at either 28 degrees C or 36 degrees C. The underlying transcriptome profile of barramundi was examined via Illumina mRNA deep sequencing to determine the major contributing gene categories giving rise to phenotypic differences in barramundi population growth. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed enrichment in categories relating to the regulation of peptidase activity as well as microtubule, cytoplasmic and cellular metabolic based processes. Further analysis of the GO category microtubule based process with associated genes from the response to stress category revealed an apparent re-organization of cytoskeletal elements in response to an induced cold stress in northern barramundi reared at 22 degrees C, when compared with northern barramundi reared at 36 degrees C. Between southern barramundi and northern barramundi reared at 36 degrees C, an analysis of the endopeptidase inhibitor activity GO category in conjunction with stress genes indicated a suppression of the complement system in southern barramundi along with an increase in the cellular stress response. The results of the present study show that southern populations of barramundi exhibit underlying molecular adaptation to cooler water temperatures, but still retain a tolerance for warm water temperatures. Furthermore, GO profiling has revealed groups of genes that underlie population differences in temperature tolerance as a means to prioritize the analysis of differential gene expression in studies of local adaptation in the future.

This research determined if the biological units matched the administrative and stock assessment units along the west coast of the BCP and the implications for fishery management. To test this hypothesis, a double digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing approach was used to generate 1 733 neutral and 6 putative outlier loci for population genomic analysis. Neutral markers detected a smooth partition in two regional groups, the southern (San Juanico, La Bocana, Bahia Asuncion, Puerto Escondido, Punta Eugenia, and Natividad Island) and northern regions (Cedros Island, Faro San Jose, San Jeronimo Island, and Guadalupe Island).

These declines could reduce genetic variation and thus hamper the species' ability to adapt. Active restoration strategies are a common conservation approach to mitigate species' declines and require genetic data on surviving populations to efficiently respond to declines while maintaining the genetic diversity needed to adapt to changing conditions. To evaluate active restoration strategies for the staghorn coral, the genetic diversity of A. cervicornis within and among populations was assessed in 77 individuals collected from 68 locations along the Florida Reef Tract (FRT) and in the Dominican Republic. Results: Genotyping by Sequencing (GBS) identified 4,764 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Pairwise nucleotide differences (p) within a population are large (similar to 37 %) and similar to p across all individuals. This high level of genetic diversity along the FRT is similar to the diversity within a small, isolated reef. Much of the genetic diversity (> 90 %) exists within a population, yet GBS analysis shows significant variation along the FRT, including 300 SNPs with significant F-ST values and significant divergence relative to distance. There are also significant differences in SNP allele frequencies over small spatial scales, exemplified by the large F-ST values among corals collected within Miami-Dade county. Conclusions: Large standing diversity was found within each population even after recent declines in abundance, including significant, potentially adaptive divergence over short distances. The data here inform conservation and management actions by uncovering population structure and high levels of diversity maintained within coral collections among sites previously shown to have little genetic divergence. More broadly, this approach demonstrates the power of GBS to resolve differences among individuals and identify subtle genetic structure, informing conservation goals with evolutionary implications.",2016,"genotyping by sequencing; coral reefs; population genomics; restoration genetics; florida reef tract","Article","ISI"
"A phylogenomic perspective on diversity, hybridization and evolutionary affinities in the stickleback genus Pungitius","10.1111/mec.15204","Guo, BC; Fang, BH; Shikano, T; Momigliano, P; Wang, C; Kravchenko, A; Merila, J","Hybridization and convergent evolution are phenomena of broad interest in evolutionary biology, but their occurrence poses challenges for reconstructing evolutionary affinities among affected taxa. Sticklebacks in the genus Pungitius are a case in point: evolutionary relationships and taxonomic validity of different species and populations in this circumpolarly distributed species complex remain contentious due to convergent evolution of traits regarded as diagnostic in their taxonomy, and possibly also due to frequent hybridization among taxa. To clarify the evolutionary relationships among different Pungitius species and populations globally, as well as to study the prevalence and extent of introgression among recognized species, genomic data sets of both reference genome-anchored single nucleotide polymorphisms and de novo assembled RAD-tag loci were constructed with RAD-seq data. Both data sets yielded topologically identical and well-supported species trees. Incongruence between nuclear and mitochondrial DNA-based trees was found and suggested possibly frequent hybridization and mitogenome capture during the evolution of Pungitius sticklebacks. Further analyses revealed evidence for frequent nuclear genetic introgression among Pungitius species, although the estimated proportions of autosomal introgression were low. Apart from providing evidence for frequent hybridization, the results challenge earlier mitochondrial and morphology-based hypotheses regarding the number of species and their affinities in this genus: at least seven extant species can be recognized on the basis of genetic data. The results also shed new light on the biogeographical history of the Pungitius-complex, including suggestion of several trans-Arctic invasions of Europe from the Northern Pacific. The well-resolved phylogeny should facilitate the utility of this genus as a model system for future comparative evolutionary studies.",2019,"biogeography; gasterosteidae; introgression; phylogenomics; rad-seq","Article","ISI"

Recent advances in genomic analyses allow for genome-wide surveys of intraspecific diversity and offer new opportunities for exploring genomic patterns of divergence. Here, we analysed genome-wide polymorphisms to measure genetic differentiation between an offshore migratory and a nonmigratory population and to define conservation units of Atlantic Cod (Gadus morhua) in coastal Labrador. A total of 141 individuals, collected from offshore sites and from a coastal site within Gilbert Bay, Labrador, were genotyped using an similar to 11ksingle nucleotide polymorphism array. Analyses of population structure revealed strong genetic differentiation between migratory offshore cod and nonmigratory Gilbert Bay cod. Genetic differentiation was elevated for loci within a chromosomal rearrangement found on linkage group 1 (LG1) that coincides with a previously found double inversion associated with migratory and nonmigratory ecotype divergence of cod in the northeast Atlantic. This inverted region includes several genes potentially associated with adaptation to differences in salinity and temperature, as well as influencing migratory behaviour. Our work provides evidence that a chromosomal rearrangement on LG1 is associated with parallel patterns of divergence between migratory and nonmigratory ecotypes on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.",2018,"atlantic cod; chromosomal rearrangement; conservation units; local adaptation; population divergence; single nucleotide polymorphism","Article","ISI"
"Detecting genotypic changes associated with selective mortality at sea in Atlantic salmon: polygenic multilocus analysis surpasses genome scan","10.1111/mec.12798","Bourret, V; Dionne, M; Bernatchez, L","Wild populations of Atlantic salmon have declined worldwide. While the causes for this decline may be complex and numerous, increased mortality at sea is predicted to be one of the major contributing factors. Examining the potential changes occurring in the genome-wide composition of populations during this migration has the potential to tease apart some of the factors influencing marine mortality. Here, we genotyped 5568 SNPs in Atlantic salmon populations representing two distinct regional genetic groups and across two cohorts to test for differential allelic and genotypic frequencies between juveniles (smolts) migrating to sea and adults (grilses) returning to freshwater after 1 year at sea. Given the complexity of the traits potentially associated with sea mortality, we contrasted the outcomes of a single-locus FST based genome scan method with a new multilocus framework to test for genetically based differential mortality at sea. While numerous outliers were identified by the single-locus analysis, no evidence for parallel, temporally repeated selection was found. In contrast, the multilocus approach detected repeated patterns of selection for a multilocus group of 34 covarying SNPs in one of the two populations. No significant pattern of selective mortality was detected in the other population, suggesting different causes of mortality among populations. These results first support the hypothesis that selection mainly causes small changes in allele frequencies among many covarying loci rather than a small number of changes in loci with large effects. They also point out that moving away from the a strict 'selective sweep paradigm' towards a multilocus genetics framework may be a more useful approach for studying the genomic signatures of natural selection on complex traits in wild populations.",2014,"conservation; local adaptation; mortality at sea; salmonids; single nucleotide polymorphism","Article","ISI"
"Comparison between parapatric mangrove sister species revealed higher photochemical efficiency in subtropical than tropical coastal vegetation under chilling stress","10.1016/j.aquabot.2020.103323","Short, AW; Chen, RJ; Wee, AKS","The distribution range of coastal plants with widespread marine seed dispersal across latitudes is often limited by their ecological adaptation to narrow temperature ranges. Such a narrow temperature range is a tradeoff between maintaining productivity at lower temperatures, and the ability to compete with more rapidly-growing species at higher temperatures. Kandelia candel and Kandelia obovata are sister mangrove species that display geographic divergence, with K. obovata being largely subtropical and K. candel being exclusively tropical. We leveraged on the parapatric distribution of these species to study the relationship between chilling tolerance and species distribution. Specifically, we compared the photochemical efficiency of photosystem II values of northern and southern populations of these species under chilling conditions. Kandelia obovata maintained significantly higher photochemical efficiency under chilling and more quickly recovered to pre-chilling levels than K. candel. Furthermore, the northern population of K. obovata maintained significantly higher photochemical efficiency than the southern population under chilling, while no intra-specific differences in chilling tolerance were found between K. candel populations. Hence, K. obovata is better adapted to the minimum temperatures encountered in the subtropics than K. candel, with populations at higher latitudes displaying higher chilling tolerance. These results underscore the importance of adaptation to different temperature brackets to the divergence of K. obovata and K. candel, and hint at the role of photosynthetic efficiency as a driving force behind the geographic divergence and speciation of coastal vegetation.",2021,"mangroves; chilling stress; geographic distribution; kandelia candel; kandelia obovate; speciation; local adaptation","Article","ISI"

Cnidarians have recently become a model group in this regard, yet species delimitation analyses have been mostly performed in octocorals. In this study, we used RAD sequencing to test the species hypotheses in a wide-spread complex of sea anemones (genus Anthothoe), contrasting this new line of evidence with their current classification. The alternative hypotheses were tested using a Bayes Factors delimitation method, and the most probable species tree was then evaluated under different biogeographic scenarios. Our results decisively rejected the current morphology-informed delimitation model and infer the presence of several cryptic species associated with distinct marine ecoregions. This spatial pattern was remarkably consistent throughout the study, highlighting the role of geographic distribution as a powerful explanatory variable of lineages diversification. The southern Gondwana pattern with episodic, jump dispersal events is the biogeographic historical representation that best fits the Anthothoe species tree. The high population differentiation possibly amplified by the occurrence of asexual reproduction makes it difficult to identify genes responsible for local adaptation, however, these seem to be mainly associated with cellular and metabolic processes. We propose a new set of species hypotheses for the Southern Hemispheric Anthothoe Glade, based on the pronounced genomic divergence observed among lineages. Although the link between the genetic and phenotypic differentiation remains elusive, newer sequencing technologies are bringing us closer to understanding the evolution of sea anemone diversity and, therefore, how to appropriately classify them.",2018,"rad sequencing; species delimitation; anthothoe; actiniaria; southern gondwana pattern; local adaptation","Article","ISI"

Restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) provides high-resolution population genomic data at low cost, and has become an important component in ecological and evolutionary studies. As with all high-throughput technologies, analytic strategies require critical validation to ensure precise and unbiased interpretation. 2. To test the impact of bioinformatic data processing on downstream population genetic inferences, we analysed mammalian RAD-seq data (>100 individuals) with 312 combinations of methodology (de novo vs. mapping to references of increasing divergence) and filtering criteria (missing data, HWE, F-IS, coverage, mapping and genotype quality). In an effort to identify commonalities and biases in all pipelines, we computed summary statistics (nr. loci, nr. SNP, pi, Het(obs), F-IS, F-ST, N-e and m) and compared the results to independent null expectations (isolation-by-distance correlation, expected transition-to-transversion ratio T-s/T-v and Mendelian mismatch rates of known parent-offspring trios). 3. We observed large differences between reference-based and de novo approaches, the former generally calling more SNPs and reducing F-IS and T-s/T-v. Data completion levels showed little impact on most summary statistics, and FST estimates were robust across all pipelines. The site frequency spectrum was highly sensitive to the chosen approach as reflected in large variance of parameter estimates across demographic scenarios (single-population bottlenecks and isolation-with-migration model). Null expectations were best met by reference-based approaches, although contingent on the specific criteria. 4. We recommend that RAD-seq studies employ reference-based approaches to a closely related genome, and due to the high stochasticity associated with the pipeline advocate the use of multiple pipelines to ensure robust population genetic and demographic inferences.",2017,"bioinformatics; gbs; genotyping by sequencing; population genetics; rad-seq","Article","ISI"

Focusing on 40 diverse coastal communities in a study region in Canada, the study utilised data from the communities' Official Community Plans to characterise their approaches to managing coastal flood risk in terms of land use regulations, construction specifications, and/or structural flood protection tools. The data revealed considerable diversity in the portfolio of tools that the communities have adopted. Tool adoption was found to correlate strongly with hazard vulnerability; that is, communities with similar physical and socio-economic vulnerability conditions tended to take similar adaptation actions. For example, established communities with highly urbanised coastlines tended to rely on structural flood protection while suburban communities with semi-developed coastlines predominantly utilised land use regulations. Institutional factors such as resource availability and local leadership, which were operationalised using survey data, exhibited surprisingly little correlation with the types of tools that communities adopted.",2020,"adaptation; coastal flooding; community; institutional capacity; land use; local government; structural flood protection; vulnerability","Article","ISI"
"PMERGE: Computational filtering of paralogous sequences from RAD-seq data","10.1002/ece3.4219","Ravindran, PN; Bentzen, P; Bradbury, IR; Beiko, RG","Restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) can identify and score thousands of genetic markers from a group of samples for population-genetics studies. One challenge of de novo RAD-seq analysis is to distinguish paralogous sequence variants (PSVs) from true single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with orthologous loci. In the absence of a reference genome, it is difficult to differentiate true SNPs from PSVs, and their impact on downstream analysis remains unclear. Here, we introduce a network-based approach, PMERGE that connects fragments based on their DNA sequence similarity to identify probable PSVs. Applying our method to de novo RAD-seq data from 150 Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) samples collected from 15 locations across the Southern Newfoundland coast allowed the identification of 87% of total PSVs identified through alignment to the Atlantic salmon genome. Removal of these paralogs altered the inferred population structure, highlighting the potential impact of filtering in RAD-seq analysis. PMERGE is also applied to a green crab (Carcinus maenas) data set consisting of 242 samples from 11 different locations and was successfully able to identify and remove the majority of paralogous loci (62%).

"Impacts of fragment genotype, habitat, and size on outplanted elkhorn coral success under thermal stress","10.3354/meps12488","Pausch, RE; Williams, DE; Miller, MW","Active coral restoration through coral 'gardening' aims to remediate some of the drastic coral cover lost on Caribbean reefs, with increasing attention to the imperiled, iconic foundation species elkhorn coral Acropora palmata. We documented 2 experiments quantifying effects of A. palmata outplant characteristics and habitat on outplant success. Two thermal stress events (summer 2014 and 2015) occurred while the experiments were underway and thus lend insight into environmental interactions and coral restoration outcomes under projected thermal regimes. In the first experiment comparing 2 size classes of a single genotype, smaller fragments produced significantly more live tissue area, experienced less bleaching, and demonstrated equal survivorship compared to larger fragments. The second experiment compared 4 genotypes outplanted to both fore reef and mid-channel patch reef habitats. Genotypes varied significantly in survivorship, bleaching severity, and net change in size, with one (CN2g) performing well in all 3 metrics, and another (SLg) exhibiting poor survivorship, the most bleaching, and smaller changes in size. Overall, bleaching was less severe and survivorship less varied between genotypes in fore reef versus patch reef habitats. Fragments returned to the site of genotype origin did not consistently outperform 'foreign' genotypes from a different habitat type. Recognizing unique attributes associated with size and specific genotypes may improve the efficacy of active coral restoration in the face of future climate scenarios.",2018,"acropora palmata; genet; bleaching; transplant; local adaptation; florida keys","Article","ISI"

Various methodological approaches are applied to measure connectivity. Biophysical modelling can explore systematically the influence of atmospheric, oceanic and ecological forcing, while genetics measures connectivity patterns within the sampling strategy limit. In the Pacific Ocean pearl farming lagoons, the activity relies on spat collecting of the black lipped pearl oyster Pinctada margaritifera occurring after the larval dispersal phase, which follows spawning from wild or farmed populations. Biophysical 3D modelling and genomic studies have both separately brought insights on within-lagoon connectivity and on the origin of spats. Here, we combined previous genetics results with new realistic biophysical modelling scenarios to elucidate connectivity in Ahe Atoll lagoon.

"Patterns of phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation in the wide elevation range of the alpine plant Arabis alpina","10.1111/1365-2745.12955","de Villemereuil, P; Mouterde, M; Gaggiotti, OE; Till-Bottraud, I","1. Local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity are two important characteristics of alpine plants to overcome the threats caused by global changes. Among alpine species, Arabis alpina is characterised by an unusually wide altitudinal amplitude, ranging from 800 to 3,100 m of elevation in the French Alps. Two non-exclusive hypotheses can explain the presence of A. alpina across this broad ecological gradient: adaptive phenotypic plasticity or local adaptation, making this species especially useful to better understand these phenomena in alpine plant species. 2. We carried out common garden experiments at two different elevations with maternal progenies from six sites that differed in altitude. We showed that (1) key phenotypic traits (morphotype, total fruit length, growth, height) display significant signs of local adaptation, (2) most traits studied are characterised by a high phenotypic plasticity between the two experimental gardens and (3) the two populations from the highest elevations lacked morphological plasticity compared to the other populations. 3. By combining two genome scan approaches (detection of selection and association methods), we isolated a candidate gene (Sucrose-Phosphate Synthase 1). This gene was associated with height and local average temperature in our studied populations, consistent with previous studies on this gene in Arabidopsis thaliana. 4. Synthesis. Given the nature of the traits involved in the detected pattern of local adaptation and the relative lack of plasticity of the two most extreme populations, our findings are consistent with a scenario of a locally adaptive stress response syndrome in high elevation populations. Due to a reduced phenotypic plasticity, an overall low intra-population genetic diversity of the adaptive traits and weak gene flow, populations of high altitude might have difficulties to cope with, e.g. a rise of temperature.",2018,"alpine ecology; arabis alpina; common garden; local adaptation; phenotypic plasticity; rad sequencing","Article","ISI"
"How to infer reliable diploid genotypes from NGS or traditional sequence data: from basic probability to experimental optimization","10.1111/j.1420-9101.2012.02488.x","Chenuil, A","The use of diploid sequence markers is still challenging despite the good quality of the information they provide. There is a common problem to all sequencing approaches [traditional cloning and sequencing of PCR amplicons as well as next-generation sequencing (NGS)]: when no variation is found within the sequences from a given individual, homozygozity can never be asserted with certainty. As a consequence, sequence data from diploid markers are mostly analysed at the population (not the individual level) particularly in animal studies. This study aims at contributing to solve this. Using the Bayes theorem and the binomial law, useful results are derived, among which: (i) the number of sequence reads per individual (or sequencing depth) which is required to ensure, at a given probability threshold, that some heterozygotes are not considered erroneously as homozygotes, as a function of the observed heterozygozity (Ho) of the locus in the population; (ii) a way of estimating Ho from low coverage NGS data; (iii) a way of testing the null hypothesis that a genetic marker corresponds to a single and diploid locus, in the absence of data from controlled crosses; (iv) strategies for characterizing sequence genotypes in populations minimizing the average number of sequence reads per individual; (v) a rationale to decide which are the variations that one needs to consider along the sequence, as a function of the sequencing depth affordable, the level of polymorphism desired and the risk of sequencing error. For traditional sequencing technology, optimal strategies appear surprisingly different from the usual empirical ones. The average number of sequence reads required to obtain 99% of fully determined genotypes never exceeds six, this value corresponding to the worst situation when Ho equals 0.6. This threshold value of Ho is strikingly stable when the tolerated proportion of nonfully resolved genotypes varies in a reasonable range. These results do not rely on the HardyWeinberg equilibrium assumption or on diallelism of nucleotidic sites.",2012,"genomics; population genetics; theory","Article","ISI"
"Intraspecific response of colonial ascidians to variable salinity stress in an era of global change","10.3354/meps11719","Dijkstra, JA; Simkanin, C","Extreme or seasonal climatic events can lead to abrupt changes in environmental conditions. These events can produce a range of organismal responses that may help to protect local-scale populations against changes in climate. Empirical studies examining intraspecific variation in reproductive and physiological responses to varying durations of environmental stress are rare. We performed laboratory experiments under varying episodic and chronic salinities using the botryllid ascidians, Botrylloides nigrum and Botryllus planus. Our study illustrates intraspecific phenotypic variation to salinity stress. Respectively 40 and 20% of B. nigrum and B. planus colonies exhibited a distinct physical behavior when exposed to low salinity treatments. They distended their cloacal cavities, exposing their pharyngeal baskets and neural glands. Physiological signs of salinity stress included higher mortality, lower heart rates and limited asexual reproduction in both species. The physical and physiological differences among clones and colonies highlight phenotypic variation within and between genotypes to selective environmental pressures in real time. Our results underscore the need to examine physiological responses of species under varying durations of environmental stress. Plastic responses of species to fine-scale environmental change may aid their persistence in a future where extreme climatic events are likely to be more common and acute.",2016,"intraspecific variation; phenotypic plasticity; local adaptation; salinity; climate extremes; ascidians","Article","ISI"

Here, the famous Gezhouba Dam and Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River were built in 1988 and 2006, for economic purposes. The natural population of Chinese sturgeon has declined since then, as these dams block its migratory route to the original spawning grounds in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. In 2013 and 2014, there was an absence of spawning where it typically happened near the Gezhouba Dam. Nevertheless, from April to June in 2015, over 1,000 larvae with different body lengths (10-35 cm) were detected along the Shanghai Yangtze Estuary; but only little is currently known about the population genetic structure of the Chinese sturgeon. Herein, we inferred population genetic parameters from 462 available Chinese sturgeon specimens based on a 421-bp fragment of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) D-loop region and 1,481,620 SNPs (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) generated by restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq). For the D-loop dataset, 15 haplotypes were determined. Randomly picked 23 individuals, representing the 15 D-loop haplotype groups, were subsequently used for further RAD-seq validation. The average nucleotide diversity calculated from the mtDNA and RAD datasets was 0.0086 and 0.000478, respectively. The overall effective female population size was calculated to be 1,255 to 2,607, and the long-term effective population size was estimated to range from 11,950 to 119,500. We observed that the genetic variability and the effective female population size of the current population in the Yangtze River are severely low, which are similar to the data reported over 10 years ago. The deduced relatively small effective population of female fish, limiting the genetic connectivity among Chinese sturgeon, should be considered a serious threat to this endangered species.",2018,"acipenser sinensis; genetic diversity; effective female population size; mtdna; rad-seq","Article","ISI"

This species' brief and holobenthic life history suggests gene flow might be limited, leaving distant populations prone to strong genetic divergence. This study used 17,523 genome-wide SNP loci to investigate genetic structuring and local adaptation patterns of H.maculosa among eight sampling sites along its reported range. Within sites, interrelatedness was very high, consistent with the limited dispersal of this taxon. However, inbreeding coefficients were proportionally lower among sites where substructuring was not detected, suggesting H.maculosa might possess a mechanism for inbreeding avoidance. Genetic divergence was extremely high among all sites, with the greatest divergence observed between both ends of the distribution, Fremantle, WA, and Stanley, TAS. Genetic distances closely followed an isolation by geographic distance pattern. Outlier analyses revealed distinct selection signatures at all sites, with the strongest divergence reported between Fremantle and the other Western Australian sites. Phylogenetic reconstructions using the described sister taxon H.fasciata (Hoyle, 1886) further supported that the genetic divergence between distal H. maculosa sites in this study was equivalent to that of between established heterospecifics within this genus. However, it is advocated that taxonomic delineations within this species should be made with caution. These data indicate that H.maculosa forms a clinal species pattern across its geographic range, with gene flow present through allele sharing between adjacent populations.

"Heterogeneous Perceptions of Social-Ecological Change Among Small-Scale Fishermen in the Central Gulf of California: Implications for Adaptive Response","10.3389/fmars.2019.00078","Frawley, TH; Crowder, LB; Broad, K","As changes in climate, governance, and organization reshape the dynamics of small-scale fisheries around the globe, the persistence of many local livelihoods appears contingent upon the ability of resource users to respond and adapt. Though significant scholarship has considered the limiting roles of resources and infrastructure, recent research has highlighted the importance of local learning and knowledge. Rather than being driven by forces exogenous to local communities, it is increasingly recognized that adaptation may be limited by perceptions and processes within them. Here, we explore knowledge production and adaptive response within a small-scale fishery in the central Gulf of California following system perturbation. Using mixed methods from the natural and social sciences, we (1) identify local drivers of social-ecological change, (2) document knowledge concerning their causes and consequences across a diverse group of small-scale fishermen, and (3) identify patterns of intracultural agreement and disagreement associated with divergent adaptive response. Results indicate that perceptions of social-ecological change were heterogeneous and that gear ownership and target species diversification were critical factors in determining the cultural models through which fishermen understood and responded to changes in the resource system. Unlike other user groups, owner-operator fishermen pursuing generalist livelihood strategies held consensus beliefs regarding changes to system structure and function and demonstrated increased ability to modify fishing tactics with the best practices for sustainable use. Our findings highlight how local knowledge can be used to assess the proximate impacts of external drivers of change and provide insight into the cultural models influencing in situ decision-making and adaptive response within modern fishery systems.",2019,"small-scale fisheries; adaptation; gulf of california; local knowledge; cultural models; social-ecological systems","Article","ISI"
"Genomic analysis of a cardinalfish with larval homing potential reveals genetic admixture in the Okinawa Islands","10.1111/mec.14169","Gould, AL; Dunlap, PV","Discrepancies between potential and observed dispersal distances of reef fish indicate the need for a better understanding of the influence of larval behaviour on recruitment and dispersal. Population genetic studies can provide insight on the degree to which populations are connected, and the development of restriction site-associated sequencing (RAD-Seq) methods has made such studies of nonmodel organisms more accessible. We applied double-digest RAD-Seq methods to test for population differentiation in the coral reef-dwelling cardinalfish, Siphamia tubifer, which based on behavioural studies, have the potential to use navigational cues to return to natal reefs. Analysis of 11,836 SNPs from fish collected at coral reefs in Okinawa, Japan, from eleven locations over 3 years reveals little genetic differentiation between groups of S. tubifer at spatial scales from 2 to 140 km and between years at one location: pairwise F-ST values were between 0.0116 and 0.0214. These results suggest that the Kuroshio Current largely influences larval dispersal in the region, and in contrast to expectations based on studies of other cardinalfishes, there is no evidence of population structure for S. tubifer at the spatial scales examined. However, analyses of outlier loci putatively under selection reveal patterns of temporal differentiation that indicate high population turnover and variable larval supply from divergent source populations between years. These findings highlight the need for more studies of fishes across various geographic regions that also examine temporal patterns of genetic differentiation to better understand the potential connections between early life-history traits and connectivity of reef fish populations.",2017,"bioluminescent; population genetics; rad-seq; siphamia tubifer; snps","Article","ISI"

This is a major concern given the expected cascade effects on ecosystem services, such as pollination. Understanding the patterns and drivers of changes in the distribution and abundance of species in our rapidly changing environment is therefore urgent. Cases of species showing trends that run counter to general population declines, especially when they deliver key ecosystem services, are especially interesting. The tree bumblebee (Bombus hypnorum), which belongs to a globally important group of pollinators, has substantially expanded its range in recent years in direct contrast to many other species within this group. Here we reconstructed the likely pattern of colonization of the UK based on RAD-seq population genomic data combined with Bayesian population modelling. This RAD-seq approach also enabled an analysis of genomic regions potentially under selection. We report a complex and dynamic colonization pattern that is most likely ongoing. Current evidence suggests that either a shift in its migration potential, and/or adaptive genomic changes have contributed to the recent range expansion of B. hypnorum. Genomic areas of potential adaptive significance included genes involved in regulation of transcription and gene expression, circadian rhythms and innate immunity. Our results are framed within the general context of understanding the factors driving successful population expansions.",2021,"bombus hypnorum; range expansion; pollinators; invasion genetics; abc population modelling; rad-seq","Article","ISI"

Nevertheless, the importance of these marginal populations as putative reservoirs of adaptive genetic variation has scarcely been considered in conservation biology. This is particularly true in marine ecosystems for which the deep refugia hypothesis proposes that disturbed shallow and marginal populations of a given species can be replenished by mesophotic ones. This hypothesis therefore assumes that identical PEIs exist between populations, neglecting the potential for adaptation at species range margins. Here, we combine reciprocal transplant and common garden experiments with population genetics analyses to decipher the PEIs in the red coral, Corallium rubrum. Our analyses reveal partially contrasting PEIs between shallow and mesophotic populations separated by approximately one hundred meters, suggesting that red coral populations may potentially be locally adapted to their environment. Based on the effective population size and connectivity analyses, we posit that genetic drift may be more important than gene flow in the adaptation of the red coral. We further investigate how adaptive divergence could impact population viability in the context of warming and demonstrate differential phenotypic buffering capacities against thermal stress. Our study questions the relevance of the deep refugia hypothesis and highlights the conservation value of marginal populations as a putative reservoir of adaptive genetic polymorphism.",2015,"common garden; corallium rubrum; deeprefugia hypothesis; marginal populations; phenotypic buffering; potential for local adaptation; reciprocal transplants","Article","ISI"

Here we synthesize high-resolution genotypic and phenotypic data to explore a largely unstudied distribution of threespine stickleback populations living in oceanic and freshwater habitats along coastal and inland regions of Oregon. Many inland aquatic habitats of Oregon remained unglaciated during the last ice age, meaning that some extant Oregon lake and river stickleback may have descended from freshwater populations established long before more well-studied, post-glacial freshwater populations. To address the degree of congruence between genetic and phenotypic divergence, we directly compared Oregon stickleback to much younger (post-glacial) Alaskan populations. We found phenotypic variation in Oregon stickleback to be primarily partitioned between oceanic and freshwater habitats, as has been documented in other stickleback systems. However, the main axis of genetic divergence was between coastal and inland regions regardless of habitat type. Furthermore, when comparing patterns between Oregon and Alaska we found similar levels of phenotypic divergence, but much greater genetic divergence among Oregon's populations.

Nematostella vectensis is a burrowing sea anemone that inhabits estuaries along the Atlantic coast of North America from Nova Scotia (45 degrees N) to Georgia (31 degrees N). Like other estuarine species, N. vectensis is exposed to large daily (>20 degrees C) and seasonal (>25 degrees C) fluctuations in temperature, requiring wide temperature tolerances. At the same time, the natural distribution of this species spans a pronounced thermal cline, which may promote the evolution of different temperature optima and tolerances in populations. We tested the thermal tolerance of N. vectensis adult and developmental stages, which showed all life cycle stages had critical temperatures within 1 degrees C (lethal temperature 39.5 to 40.5 degrees C). When temperature tolerance values were compared with recorded field data, N. vectensis is living in environments very close to their physiological limit. We utilized common garden experiments (13, 21, and 29 degrees C) to test for temperature-specific growth and regeneration rates in N. vectensis from different portions of this species' range. Temperature had a significant effect on growth and regeneration rate in all clonal lines, with a significant negative relationship between latitude of origin and growth rate at 29 degrees C. Individuals from higher latitudes did not exhibit higher growth rates at cooler temperatures. Together, our results show a combination of broad thermal tolerances for developmental and adult stages and evidence for local adaptation to higher temperatures in populations living in lower latitude locations that would be physiologically compromised with future warming.",2013,"growth rate; latitude; local adaptation; nematostella; regeneration; temperature tolerance","Article","ISI"

In the fjords of southern Norway, 2 ecotypes of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua co-exist during their juvenile life stage. Cod of the North Sea ecotype are on average 2 cm larger than the fjord ecotype at the end of their first growing season in October, suggesting either differences in spawning time or differences in growth during the larval and early juvenile phase. We analysed 24 352 daily otolith increments from 145 cod sampled in September 2000, 2003, 2008 and 2015 at 2 locations to estimate individual hatching times and daily growth rates. There was no significant difference in hatching time between ecotypes, locations or years. Population-specific models of the effect of year, temperature and fish length on growth rates showed that the North Sea ecotype grew significantly faster than the fjord ecotype, but growth rate differences were small until the juveniles reached similar to 40 mm and disappeared again in juveniles larger than 110 mm. The size range (40110 mm) corresponds to the period following settling. This study documents how vital rates (e.g. growth rates) may change rapidly at ontogenetic transition points, leading to different phenotypic trajectories in co-existing ecotypes. It also highlights the importance of settlement as a key life-history transition that may amplify small existing differences in growth rates through positive feedback of size on competitive ability and eventually recruitment.",2020,"otoliths; growth; nursery; temperature; competition; local adaptation","Article","ISI"

However. the description of functional microbial diversity occurring in these regions remains only partially documented. In this article, we use a numerical model, simulating a large number of phytoplankton phenotypes to explore the three-dimensional spatial patterns of phytoplankton abundance and diversity in the Iroise Sea (western Brittany). Our results suggest that, in boreal summer, a seasonally marked tidal front shapes the phytoplankton species richness. A diversity maximum is found in the surface mixed layer located slightly west of the tidal front (i.e., not strictly co-localized with high biomass concentrations) which separates tidally mixed from stratified waters. Differences in phenotypic composition between sub-regions with distinct hydrodynamic regimes (defined by vertical mixing, nutrients gradients and light penetration) are discussed. Local growth and/or physical transport of phytoplankton phenotypes are shown to explain our simulated diversity distribution. We find that a large fraction (64%) of phenotypes present during the considered period of September are ubiquitous, found in the frontal area and on both sides of the front (i.e., over the full simulated domain). The frontal area does not exhibit significant differences between its community composition and that of either the well-mixed region or an offshore Deep Chlorophyll Maximum (DCM). Only three phenotypes (out of 77) specifically grow locally and are found at substantial concentration only in the surface diversity maximum. Thus, this diversity maximum is composed of a combination of ubiquitous phenotypes with specific picoplankton deriving from offshore, stratified waters (including specific phenotypes from both the surface and the DCM) and imported through physical transport, completed by a few local phenotypes. These results are discussed in light of the three-dimensional general circulation at frontal interfaces. Processes identified by this study are likely to be common in tidal front environments and may be generalized to other shallow, tidally mixed environments worldwide.

Of these SNPs, 12,712 high-confidence SNPs were subjected to high-throughput genotyping and assigned to 24 consensus linkage groups (LGs). The total length of the genetic linkage map was 3,497.29 cM with an average distance of 0.47 cM between loci, thereby representing the densest genetic map currently reported for Japanese flounder. Nine positive quantitative trait loci (QTLs) forming two main clusters for Vibrio anguillarum disease resistance were detected. All QTLs could explain 5.1-8.38% of the total phenotypic variation. Synteny analysis of the QTL regions on the genome assembly revealed 12 immune-related genes, among them 4 genes strongly associated with V. anguillarum disease resistance.

Half of the combined library was used for probe synthesis, and half was sequenced to evaluate capture efficiency. Genomic DNA was extracted from all individuals, enriched via captured probes, and sequenced directly. We found that EecSeq had an average capture sensitivity of 86.8% across all known exons and had over 99.4% sensitivity for exons with detectable levels of expression in the mRNA library. For all mapped reads, over 47.9% mapped to exons and 37.0% mapped to expressed targets, which is similar to previously published exon capture studies. EecSeq displayed relatively even coverage within exons (i.e., minor edge effects) and even coverage across exon GC content. We discovered 5,951 SNPs with a minimum average coverage of 80x, with 3,508 SNPs appearing in exonic regions. We show that EecSeq provides comparable, if not superior, specificity and capture efficiency compared to costly, traditional methods.",2018,"exome capture; population genomics; selection","Article","ISI"
"Genotyping-by-sequencing for estimating relatedness in nonmodel organisms: Avoiding the trap of precise bias","10.1111/1755-0998.12739","Attard, CRM; Beheregaray, LB; Moller, LM","There has been remarkably little attention to using the high resolution provided by genotyping-by-sequencing (i.e., RADseq and similar methods) for assessing relatedness in wildlife populations. A major hurdle is the genotyping error, especially allelic dropout, often found in this type of data that could lead to downward-biased, yet precise, estimates of relatedness. Here, we assess the applicability of genotyping-by-sequencing for relatedness inferences given its relatively high genotyping error rate. Individuals of known relatedness were simulated under genotyping error, allelic dropout and missing data scenarios based on an empirical ddRAD data set, and their true relatedness was compared to that estimated by seven relatedness estimators. We found that an estimator chosen through such analyses can circumvent the influence of genotyping error, with the estimator of Ritland (Genetics Research, 67, 175) shown to be unaffected by allelic dropout and to be the most accurate when there is genotyping error. We also found that the choice of estimator should not rely solely on the strength of correlation between estimated and true relatedness as a strong correlation does not necessarily mean estimates are close to true relatedness. We also demonstrated how even a large SNP data set with genotyping error (allelic dropout or otherwise) or missing data still performs better than a perfectly genotyped microsatellite data set of tens of markers. The simulation-based approach used here can be easily implemented by others on their own genotyping-by-sequencing data sets to confirm the most appropriate and powerful estimator for their data.",2018,"double-digest restriction site-associated dna; low coverage; next-generation sequencing; pedigree; population genomics; relationships","Article","ISI"
"Stock assessment for eastern oyster seed production and field grow-out in Louisiana","10.1016/j.aquaculture.2016.09.034","Leonhardt, JM; Casas, S; Supan, JE; La Peyre, JF","There is little information on the performance of oyster populations from Louisiana estuaries limiting the ability to choose stocks for hatchery seed production and field grow-out. The objectives of this study were therefore to compare the mortality, growth, dermo (Perkinsus marinus) infection intensity and condition index of the progeny of wild oysters collected from three Louisiana estuaries differing in salinity regime and oysters specifically selected for dermo resistance. Progeny were deployed in cages in the field, along a salinity gradient in coastal Louisiana. Overall, salinity and temperature had major impacts on the mortality, growth, dermo infection intensity and condition index of oysters of all four stocks and a few differences between stocks could be shown at some sites. At the lowest salinity site, the progeny of wild oysters from Sister Lake, a low salinity estuarine lake, had the lowest mortality suggesting enhanced tolerance to low salinity conditions compared to the other stocks. At the highest salinity site, the progeny of wild oysters from Lake Calcasieu, a high salinity estuarine lake, had the lowest mortality during summer concomitant with increasing dermo infection intensities suggesting a better resistance to dermo disease compared to the other wild stocks and confirming an earlier finding. This initial result suggests that the stocks used are genetically differentiated with respect to low salinity tolerance as well as dermo-related mortality at high salinity and that stock selection for aquaculture grow-out or restoration effort will benefit from being site-specific and dependent on the dominant environmental conditions.

Specifically, we identified microsatellites by means of pyrosequencing and variable regions in the mitochondrial genome using RAD-seq libraries that were generated with Illumina sequencing. A total of 4 339 putative microsatellites were found, of which 32 were tested on individuals collected along the southeast coast of South Africa. Of those, five microsatellites cross-amplified consistently in both species, and these were tested on a total of 260 samples. Additionally, we mapped the partial mitochondrial genome of a small number of individuals from both species and identified the most-variable regions by comparing a small number of individuals from all regions where these species have been recorded (including western South Africa and northwest Africa). The genetic markers developed here can be used to conduct population genetic studies, to monitor range shifts under contemporary climate change, and to help in preserving ecosystem functioning along African coastlines.",2021,"ascidians; illumina sequencing; microsatellites; mitochondrial markers; mitogenome; rad-seq; short tandem repeats","Article","ISI"

Among bony fishes, sperm are adapted to function in a narrow salinity range. A notable exception is the family Gobiidae, where several species reproduce across a wide salinity range. The family also contains several wide-spread invasive species. To better understand how these fishes tolerate such varying conditions, we measured sperm performance in relation to salinity from a freshwater and a brackish population within their ancestral Ponto-Caspian region of the round goby, Neogobius melanostomus. These two ancestral populations were then compared to nine additional invaded sites across northern Europe, both in terms of their sperm traits and by using genomic SNP markers. Our results show clear patterns of ancestral adaptations to freshwater and brackish salinities in their sperm performance. Population genomic analyses show that the ancestral ecotypes have generally established themselves in environments that fit their sperm adaptations. Sites close to ports with intense shipping show that both outbreeding and admixture can affect the sperm performance of a population in a given salinity. Rapid adaptation to local conditions is also supported at some sites. Historical and contemporary evolution in the traits of the round goby sperm cells is tightly linked to the population and seascape genomics as well as biogeographic processes in these invasive fishes. Since the risk of a population establishing in an area is related to the genotype by environment match, port connectivity and the ancestry of the round goby population can likely be useful for predicting the species spread.",2021,"gametes; gobiidae; invasive; local adaptation; neogobius melanostomus; nis; ponto-caspian; round goby","Article","ISI"

Using a novel perspective, we investigated the potential influence of endemism on the relationship between larval supply and recruitment in reef fish populations at Lord Howe Island, Australia. Larval supply and recruitment were measured for three regional endemic and four widespread non-endemic species using light traps, artificial collectors, and underwater visual censuses. Recruitment was correlated with larval supply in endemics but not in non-endemics, likely due to a combination of low larval supply and post-settlement survival of non-endemics. Surveys also indicated that endemics were far more abundant and occurred in more locations than closely related non-endemics. These preliminary findings suggest that either local adaptation enhances recruitment in endemics through higher larval replenishment rates or reduced post-settlement mortality, populations of widespread species at the periphery of their range are poorly adapted to local environmental conditions and therefore experience lower and more variable settlement and post-settlement survival rates, or both.",2010,"endemism; larval supply; recruitment; reef fish; local adaptation","Article","ISI"
"The impact of global selection on local adaptation and reproductive isolation","10.1098/rstb.2019.0531","Bisschop, G; Setter, D; Rafajlovic, M; Baird, SJE; Lohse, K","Despite the homogenizing effect of strong gene flow between two populations, adaptation under symmetric divergent selection pressures results in partial reproductive isolation: adaptive substitutions act as local barriers to gene flow, and if divergent selection continues unimpeded, this will result in complete reproductive isolation of the two populations, i.e. speciation. However, a key issue in framing the process of speciation as a tension between local adaptation and the homogenizing force of gene flow is that the mutation process is blind to changes in the environment and therefore tends to limit adaptation. Here we investigate how globally beneficial mutations (GBMs) affect divergent local adaptation and reproductive isolation. When phenotypic divergence is finite, we show that the presence of GBMs limits local adaptation, generating a persistent genetic load at the loci that contribute to the trait under divergent selection and reducing genome-wide divergence. Furthermore, we show that while GBMs cannot prohibit the process of continuous differentiation, they induce a substantial delay in the genome-wide shutdown of gene flow.

Here, we analysed the transcriptome-wide mRNA sequences, as well as the morphology of 18 strains of Alexandrium minutum, a dinoflagellate responsible for harmful algal blooms worldwide, to investigate the functional bases of a divergence event. Analysis of the joint site frequency spectrum (JSFS) pointed towards an ancestral divergence in complete isolations followed by a secondary contact resulting in gene flow between the two diverging groups, but heterogeneous across sites. The sites displaying fixed SNPs were associated with a highly restricted gene flow and a strong overrepresentation of nonsynonymous polymorphism, suggesting the importance of selective pressures as drivers of the divergence. The most divergent transcripts were homologs to genes involved in calcium/potassium fluxes across the membrane, calcium transduction signal and saxitoxin production. The implication of these results in terms of ecological divergence and build-up of reproductive isolation is discussed. Dinoflagellates are especially difficult to study in the field at the ecological level due to their small size and the dynamic nature of their natural environment, but also at the genomic level due to their huge and complex genome and the absence of closely related model organism.

"Experimental evidence for population variability of reproductive traits in Japanese anchovy Engraulis japonicus","10.1016/j.rsma.2021.102123","Yoneda, M; Yamamoto, M; Tsuzaki, T","Small pelagic fishes show spatiotemporal variations in reproductive traits due probably to responses to varying environmental conditions, but potential genetic contributions to such variations have received little attention. This study compared several reproductive traits of Japanese anchovy between two geographically isolated populations, from the central Seto Inland Sea and Omura Bay, western Japan, under common environmental conditions over three generations. There were no significant differences in age and standard length at sexual maturation between populations. Temperature-mediated variation in egg size was found in the two populations with decrease in egg size as temperature increased. However, regression analysis showed that the relationship between egg size and temperature differed significantly between the two populations over three generations. There was also a significant difference in the relative batch fecundity of the F1 and F2 generations between populations. Hence, females from the central Seto Inland Sea could produce a larger number of smaller eggs than females from Omura Bay. Variation in egg size appears to reflect significant differences in larval size at hatch and the onset of feeding in waters of different temperatures. These findings suggest that the thermal reaction norms of egg size observed in the two populations could have genetic contributions and that their egg traits may mediate a possible difference in offspring viability during early life stages.

We used double-digest restriction-side associated DNA (RAD) sequencing to evaluate shifts in genome-wide genetic diversity and investigate the presence of parallel evolution associated with urban-specific selection factors in wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus). Our replicated paired study design involved 12 individuals from each of 4 rural and urban populations to improve our confidence that detected signals of selection are indeed associated with urbanization. Genetic diversity measures were less for urban populations; however, the effect size was small, suggesting little biological consequence. Using an F-ST outlier approach, we identified 37 of 8344 genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms with consistent evidence of directional selection across replicates. A genome-wide association study analysis detected modest support for an association between environment type and 12 of the 37 F-ST outlier loci.

Here, we investigate the influence of the environment, including seasonal temperature and salinity, on the population structure of the invasive European green crab (Carcinus maenas) in eastern North America. Green crab populations in eastern North America are associated with two independent invasions, previously shown to consist of distinct northern and southern ecotypes, with a contact zone in southern Nova Scotia, Canada. Using a RAD-seq panel of 9,137 genomewide SNPs, we detected 41 SNPs (0.49%) whose allele frequencies were highly correlated with environmental data. A principal components analysis of 25 environmental variables differentiated populations into northern, southern, and admixed sites in concordance with the observed genomic spatial structure. Furthermore, a spatial principal components analysis conducted on genomic and geographic data revealed a high degree of global structure (p<.0001) partitioning a northern and southern ecotype. Redundancy and partial redundancy analyses revealed that among the environmental variables tested, winter sea surface temperature had the strongest association with spatial structuring, suggesting that it is an important factor defining range and expansion limits of each ecotype.

"Thermal plasticity in farmed, wild and hybrid Atlantic salmon during early development: has domestication caused divergence in low temperature tolerance?","10.1186/s12862-016-0607-2","Solberg, MF; Dyrhovden, L; Matre, IH; Glover, KA","Background: In the past three decades, millions of domesticated Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L. have escaped from farms into the wild. Their offspring display reduced survival in the natural environment, which demonstrates that gene-flow is likely to have a negative effect on wild populations. However, inter-population differences in introgression of farmed salmon have been observed, and the underlying ecological mechanisms remain enigmatic. We hypothesised that domestication-driven divergence in tolerance to low temperatures during early development may contribute to lower survival of farmed salmon offspring in the wild, which in turn, may influence patterns of introgression among populations exposed to different temperature regimes. We reared the offspring of 35 families of wild, farmed and hybrid origin at three temperatures (3.9, 5.6 and 12 degrees C) from the onset of exogenous feeding and throughout their first summer. Thermal reaction norms for growth and survival were investigated along the gradient. Results: The main results of this study, which is based upon the analysis of juvenile salmon from five wild strains, two farmed strains and two hybrid strains, can be summarised as; (i) salmon of all origins were able to successfully initiate feeding at all temperatures and similar survival reaction norms were detected in all strains across the temperature gradient; (ii) deviating growth reaction norms were detected between strains, although this result was most likely due to an overall lack of growth in the lower temperature treatments. Conclusions: This study revealed no evidence of domesticated-driven divergence in low temperature tolerance in Atlantic salmon during early development. Although the potential interaction between low temperature and other river-specific factors cannot be excluded, our results indicate that the reduced survival of farmed offspring in the wild is not explained by farmed salmon displaying impaired abilities to initiate feeding at low temperatures. We therefore suggest that the observed inter-population patterns of introgression are not low-temperature driven and that other ecological or biological factors may explain why detection of farmed salmon in wild rivers is not synonymous with introgression. In general, our results support the literature indicating that phenotypic plasticity instead of thermal adaption has been selected for in Atlantic salmon.",2016,"ecology; escapees; growth; introgression; local adaptation; reaction norms; salmon strains; survival phenotypic plasticity; salmonids","Article","ISI"

Here, we critically evaluate the feasibility and likely benefits of this approach in conservation. We find that population genetics theory and empirical results show that conserving genome-wide genetic variation is generally the best approach to prevent inbreeding depression and loss of adaptive potential from driving populations toward extinction. Focusing conservation efforts on presumably functional genetic variation will only be feasible occasionally, often misleading, and counterproductive when prioritized over genome-wide genetic variation.

In order to improve our understanding of species in corals we here investigated phylogenetic relationships between morphologically defined species and genetic lineages in the genus Galaxea (Euphyllidae) using a combined phylogenomic and phylogeographic approach. Previous studies revealed the nominal species G. fascicularis included three genetically well-differentiated lineages (L, S & L+) in the western Pacific, but their distribution and relationship to other species in the genus was unknown. Based on genomic (RAD-seq) and mitochondrial sequence data (non-coding region between cytb and ND2) we investigated whether the morphological taxa represent genetically coherent entities and what is the phylogenetic relationship and spatial distribution of the three lineages of G. fascicularis throughout the observed species range. Using the RAD-seq data, we find that the genus Galaxea is monophyletic and contains three distinct clades: an Indo-Pacific, a Pacific, and a small clade restricted to the Chagos Archipelago. The three lineages of G. fascicularis were associated with different RAD-seq clades, with the 'L' lineage showing some morphological distinction from the other two lineages (larger more asymmetrical polyps). In addition to these, three more genetic lineages in G. fascicularis may be distinguished- a Chagossian, an Ogasawaran, and one from the Indian-Red Sea. Among nominal taxa for which we have multiple samples, G. horrescens was the only monophyletic species. The mitochondrial non-coding region is highly conserved apart of the length polymorphism used to define L, S & L+ lineages and lacks the power to distinguish morphological and genetic groups resolved with genomic RAD-sequencing. The polyphyletic nature of most species warrants a careful examination of the accepted taxonomy of this group with voucher collections and their comparison to type specimens to resolve species boundaries.

This study focused onM. margaritiferafrom six locations within two stream systems in central and eastern Massachusetts, USA, to understand the historical impact of damming and habitat fragmentation on local population structure and genetic diversity. Approximately 300 informative single nucleotide polymorphisms were generated from 59 individuals across six geographical locations, using the restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing approach. Genotypes were also gleaned from publicly available RNA sequencing data of 23 FrenchM. margaritiferasamples. Predictions of population structure using discriminant analysis of principal components and fastStructure both indicate the existence of a single genetic population in central and eastern Massachusetts, and a clear separation from French individuals. This observation is further supported by frequency-based calculations of population genetics, which indicate near-complete admixture and a high number of migrants between Massachusetts sites. These results suggest that the effects of habitat fragmentation from damming in the past century have not radiated through the Massachusetts population ofM. margaritifera, potentially because of the long lifespan and generation time of the species. However, the Massachusetts population has similar levels of genetic diversity to the endangered populations in Europe, and these factors should be considered by conservationists when creating conservation and management plans. The findings of this study suggest that populations in North America are reasonably healthy and diverse and that, as one population, the study area represents one conservation unit. This indicates that dam removal, habitat restoration, and captive breeding programmes may be viable options to increase the small population numbers and retain a substantial portion of genetic diversity without sacrificing local adaptation.",2020,"endangered species; freshwater mussel; genetic diversity; habitat fragmentation; population genetics; rad-seq; snps","Article","ISI"

Genome-scan methods are used for screening genomewide patterns of DNA polymorphism to detect signatures of positive selection. There are two main types ofmethods: (i) 'outlier' detection methods based on F-ST that detect loci with high differentiation compared to the rest of the genome and (ii) environmental association methods that test the association between allele frequencies and environmental variables. 2. We present a new F-ST-based genome-scan method, BayeScEnv, which incorporates environmental information in the form of 'environmental differentiation'. It is based on the F model, but, as opposed to existing approaches, it considers two locus-specific effects: one due to divergent selection and the other due to various other processes different from local adaptation (e.g. range expansions, differences in mutation rates across loci or background selection). The method was developped in C++ and is available at http://github.com/devillemereuil/bayescenv. 3. A simulation study shows that our method has a much lower false positive rate than an existing FST-based method, BayeScan, under a wide range of demographic scenarios. Although it has lower power, it leads to a better compromise between power and false positive rate. 4.

Despite strong selection exerted on the host, the evolutionary response of invaders to newly acquired pathogens has rarely been considered. The two independent and genetically distinct invasions of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas into the North Sea represent an ideal model system to study fast evolutionary responses of invasive populations. By exposing both invasion sources to ubiquitous and phylogenetically diverse pathogens (Vibrio spp.), we demonstrate that within a few generations hosts adapted to newly encountered pathogen communities. However, local adaptation only became apparent in selective environments, i.e. at elevated temperatures reflecting patterns of disease outbreaks in natural populations. Resistance against sympatric and allopatric Vibrio spp. strains was dominantly inherited in crosses between both invasion sources, resulting in an overall higher resistance of admixed individuals than pure lines. Therefore, we suggest that a simple genetic resistance mechanism of the host is matched to a common virulence mechanism shared by local Vibrio strains. This combination might have facilitated a fast evolutionary response that can explain another dimension of why invasive species can be so successful in newly invaded ranges.",2015,"local adaptation; multi-locus sequence typing; multi-host parasites; dominant inheritance; host-parasite coevolution","Article","ISI"

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climatic Change (IPCC), the frequency and intensity of warming events will rise due to global changes. Halophyte plants, inhabiting salt marshes are known for being highly tolerant to various abiotic stresses, nonetheless, although it has been acknowledged that the tolerance response is species specific there could also be differences at the population level. The present work aims to determine if the life history of two halophytes (Halimione portulacoides and Spartina patens), namely in terms of contaminant exposure, influences inter-populational heat tolerance. For this purpose, individuals from both species collected at pristine and contaminated sites were exposed to normal and increased temperature conditions, and its physiological fitness evaluated throughout biochemical and biophysical analysis. The photobiological traits, pigment and fatty acid profiles and oxidative stress biomarkers analyses of warming treated individuals, indicate that chronic heavy metal pre-conditioning significantly influences the heat stress tolerance of the native halophyte plants. Halimione portulacoides individuals collected at heavy metal contaminated salt marsh appeared more tolerant to heat stress. On the other hand, the invasive S. patens from the pristine site showed higher tolerance to heat stress. Thus, the pre-conditioning influences the tolerance mechanisms can affect the way in which salt marsh communities will evolve in the future, possibly being different through salt marshes. The contaminated marsh can be more resilient to invasion than the non-contaminated marsh, since the native species has benefited from this pre-conditioning. Moreover, and from the ecophysiological point the set of biophysical and biochemical indicators were tested, show a high efficiency in describing the ecophysiological traits, both between species and populations, facing different pre-conditioning histories.",2020,"intraspecific variability; local adaptation; non-indigenous species; warming stress","Article","ISI"

Spatial conservation units (CUs) for one or more species have been defined using similarities in communities, habitats, and resource management concerns. Additionally, CU boundaries can be informed by population genetic structure. Here, we determined the population structure of the Bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), a migratory grassland bird. Its breeding range spans longitudinally across most of North America in the northern U.S. and southern Canada, and its population has declined by 59% from 1971 to 2014. We sampled blood from Bobolinks at seven breeding sites and used a ddRAD sequencing approach to identify 3236 SNPs for population genetic analyses. Using the Bayesian clustering approach, STRUCTURE, we found low levels of genetic differentiation across the breeding range. F-st values ranged from 0.002 to 0.036 among all population pairs, and genetic structure followed an isolation by distance model. Despite low levels of genetic differentiation, we found evidence for four genetic groupings-breeding populations in Oregon and British Columbia were distinct from each other as well as from Central and eastern North American breeding populations. Investigating the demographic history of the populations using approximate Bayesian computation, we found evidence that western Bobolink populations are not relict populations but instead were founded during a recent westward range expansion, possibly enabled by agricultural expansion. We identify four genetics-based CUs that may serve as a complementary spatial framework, broader in scale compared to the commonly-used Bird Conservation Regions, for defining and achieving population objectives.",2022,"conservation genetics; demographic history; relict population; rad-seq; bobolink; dolichonyx oryzivorus","Article","ISI"

"Lack of spatial and temporal genetic structure of Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica) populations","10.1007/s10592-019-01146-8","Gong, XL; Davenport, ER; Wang, DH; Clark, AG","Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica) is an important food source in East Asia whose population has dramatically declined since the 1970s. Despite past analysis with DNA sequencing, microsatellite and isozyme methods, management decisions remain hampered by contradictory findings. For example, it remains unresolved whether Japanese eels are a single panmictic population or whether they harbor significant substructure. Accurate assessment of population genetic substructure, both spatial and temporal, is essential for determining the relevant number of distinct management units appropriate for this species. In the present study, we assayed genetic variation genome-wide using Restriction Site Associated DNA Sequencing (RAD-seq) technology to analyze the population genetic structure of Japanese eels. For analysis of temporal isolation, five cohort samples were collected yearly from 2005 to 2009 in the Yangtze River Estuary. For analysis of spatial structure, five arrival wave samples were collected in China in 2009, and two arrival wave samples were collected in Japan in 2001. In each cohort of each arrival wave, five individuals were collected for a total of 55 eels sampled. In total, 214,210 loci were identified from these individuals, 106,652 of which satisfied quality checks and were retained for further analysis. There was relatively little population differentiation between arrival waves and cohorts collected either at different locations during the same year (F-st=0.077) or at the same location collected over subsequent years (F-st=0.082), and locations displayed no consistent isolation-by-distance.",2019,"anguilla japonica; japanese eel; population genetic structure; rad-seq; temporal and spatial","Article","ISI"

Apex predators play a disproportionately determinant role through their influence and dependence on the dynamics of prey species. Their demographic fluctuations are thus likely to reflect changes in their respective ecological communities and habitat. Here, we investigate the historical population dynamics of the killer whale based on draft nuclear genome data for the Northern Hemisphere and mtDNA data worldwide. We infer a relatively stable population size throughout most of the Pleistocene, followed by an order of magnitude decline and bottleneck during the Weichselian glacial period. Global mtDNA data indicate that while most populations declined, at least one population retained diversity in a stable, productive ecosystem off southern Africa. We conclude that environmental changes during the last glacial period promoted the decline of a top ocean predator, that these events contributed to the pattern of diversity among extant populations, and that the relatively high diversity of a population currently in productive, stable habitat off South Africa suggests a role for ocean productivity in the widespread decline.",2014,"genomics; demographics; cetacea; population bottleneck","Article","ISI"

An emerging genomic toolset, which has been most comprehensively harnessed in the reconstruction of human evolutionary history, enables molecular ecologists to elucidate complex population histories. Killer whales have limited extrinsic barriers to dispersal and have radiated globally, and are therefore a good candidate model for the application of such tools. Here, we analyse a global data set of killer whale genomes in a rare attempt to elucidate global population structure in a nonhuman species. We identify a pattern of genetic homogenisation at lower latitudes and the greatest differentiation at high latitudes, even between currently sympatric lineages. The processes underlying the major axis of structure include high drift at the edge of species' range, likely associated with founder effects and allelic surfing during postglacial range expansion. Divergence between Antarctic and non-Antarctic lineages is further driven by ancestry segments with up to fourfold older coalescence time than the genome-wide average; relicts of a previous vicariance during an earlier glacial cycle. Our study further underpins that episodic gene flow is ubiquitous in natural populations, and can occur across great distances and after substantial periods of isolation between populations. Thus, understanding the evolutionary history of a species requires comprehensive geographic sampling and genome-wide data to sample the variation in ancestry within individuals.",2019,"admixture; drift; genomics; population structure; secondary contact","Article","ISI"

A population genomic approach, using a classical neutrality test and various F-st-outlier detection methods was employed to evaluate genome-wide polymorphism data in order to identify loci that may be candidates for selection amongst six populations (three cultured and three wild) of the South African abalone, Haliotis midae. Approximately 9% of the genome-wide microsatellite markers were putatively subject to directional selection, whilst 6-18% of the genome is thought to be influenced by balancing selection. Genetic diversity estimates for candidate loci under directional selection was significantly reduced in comparison to candidate neutral loci, whilst candidate balancing selection loci demonstrated significantly higher levels of genetic diversity (Kruskal-Wallis test, P < 0.05). Pairwise F-st estimates based on candidate directional selection loci also demonstrated increased levels of differentiation between study populations. Various candidate loci under selection showed significant inter-chromosomal linkage disequilibrium, suggesting possible gene-networks underling adaptive phenotypes. Furthermore, several loci had significant hits to known genes when performing BLAST searches to NCBI's non-redundant databases, whilst others are known to be derived from expressed sequences even though homology to a known gene could not be established. A number of loci also demonstrated relatively high similarity to transposable elements.

High-throughput sequencing has begun to unravel the mechanisms and evolutionary history of these interesting features by establishing relationships in the genotype-phenotype map. However, some genotype-phenotype analyses require a higher order of contiguity than what initial scaffolded (fragmented genome assembly where contigs have been assemble into scaffolds) genome assemblies can provide. Here, we used 5,685 high-quality RAD-Seq markers from a single mapping family to order 84% of the scaffolded genome assembly to 24 chromosomes. This serves to: 1) expand the killifish genomic toolkit, 2) estimate genome-wide recombination rates, and 3) compare genome synteny to humans and other fishes. After initially building our map, we found that the selection of thresholds for sequence data filtration highly impacted scaffold placement in the map. We outline each step of the approach that dramatically improved our map to help guide others toward more effective linkage mapping for genome assembly. Our final map supports strong conservation of genomic synteny among closely related fish species and reveals previously described chromosomal rearrangements between more distantly related clades. However, we also commonly found minor scaffold misorientations in F. heteroclitus and in other assemblies, suggesting that further mapping (such as optical mapping) is necessary for finer scale resolution of genome structure. Lastly, we discuss the problems that would be expected from misoriented/unplaced scaffolds and stress the importance of a quality mapped genome as a key feature for further investigating population and comparative genomic questions with F. heteroclitus and other taxa.",2019,"atlantic killifish; meiotic linkage map; rad-seq; genome synteny; scaffold inversions","Article","ISI"

Instead, selection from the standing genetic variation permits rapid adaptation via soft sweeps or polygenic adaptation. Empirical evidence of this process in nature is currently limited but accumulating.ResultsWe provide genome-wide analyses of rapid evolution in Fundulus heteroclitus populations subjected to recently elevated temperatures due to coastal power station thermal effluents using 5449 SNPs across two effluent-affected and four reference populations. Bayesian and multivariate analyses of population genomic structure reveal a substantial portion of genetic variation that is most parsimoniously explained by selection at the site of thermal effluents. An F-ST outlier approach in conjunction with additional conservative requirements identify significant allele frequency differentiation that exceeds neutral expectations among exposed and closely related reference populations. Genomic variation patterns near these candidate loci reveal that individuals living near thermal effluents have rapidly evolved from the standing genetic variation through small allele frequency changes at many loci in a pattern consistent with polygenic selection on the standing genetic variation.ConclusionsWhile the ultimate trajectory of selection in these populations is unknown and we survey only a minority of genomic loci, our findings suggest that polygenic models of adaptation may play important roles in large, natural populations experiencing recent selection due to environmental changes that cause broad physiological impacts.",2019,"population genomics - empirical; selective sweeps; polygenic adaptation; adaptation; fish","Article","ISI"

Recently, H. fulgens was chosen for possible stock restoration via translocation of wild adults to depleted habitat and supplementation through releasing cultured individuals. Before a management plan could be developed, however, an understanding of the species' natural population genetic structure was needed. We used a genomic technique called restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RADSeq) to address the issue. RADSeq enabled discovery of 1,209 single nucleotide polymorphisms theoretically spread genome-wide in H. fulgens. Analyses suggested the species may be panmictic throughout our sampled range, with an effective population size (N-e) of 1,100-3,600. Hence, limitations to management, such as requiring local broodstock and restricting translocation potential, might be unnecessary. Sites with larger populations may be suitable sources for restoration of depleted sites (e.g. the Palos Verdes Peninsula), although the extent of local adaptation remains unknown. Despite this potential for restoration, results gathered on a sample of cultured H. fulgens illustrated how quickly genetic diversity can be lost through captive breeding. To help mitigate a drop in Ne due to hatchery supplementation, we recommend collection and replacement of >= 100 wild abalone per generation for broodstock and close management of the proportion of cultured individuals in the wild. Successful implementation will depend on operational capacity and the resilience of the source populations to broodstock collection.",2014,"abalone; genomics; population genetics; restriction site associated dna sequencing; single nucleotide polymorphism; stock enhancement","Article","ISI"

We hypothesized that P. sauciatus shows morphological variations to inhabit contrasting environments. Highly significant differences in shell shape were found depending on both substrate type and coastal exposure. The most marked differences were found between exposed and sheltered environments. Rounded shells in exposed environments may be explained by physiological reasons, since larger muscles are needed to ensure attachment to substrate in areas subject to harsh conditions. On the other side, conically-shaped shells may accommodate a larger body but with a smaller foot, an adaptation to sheltered environments. Slight shape variations were also observed among substrates, mostly in the degree of differentiation of some whorls. Differences could be related to a particular use of habitat and/or to the degree of exposure to water current. These results suggest that P. sauciatus is locally adapted to varying coastal hydrodynamics and may be considered as a good model in studies on adaptations of fauna to certain climate change effects.",2020,"phorcus sauciatus; local adaptation; phenotypes; wave effect; substrate effect; geometric morphometrics","Article","ISI"

We investigated population genetic patterns of temperate anemones (Anthopleura spp.) and their endosymbiont Breviolum 'muscatinei', across an extensive geographical range to identify the spatial scales over which local adaptation is possible. Similar to previously published results, two solitary host species exhibited isolation by distance across hundreds of kilometres.

Identifying the genomic basis underlying divergence with gene flow is a major task in evolutionary genomics. Most approaches (e.g., outlier scans) focus on genomic regions of high differentiation. However, not all genomic architectures potentially underlying divergence are expected to show extreme differentiation. Here, we develop an approach that combines hybrid zone analysis (i.e., focuses on spatial patterns of allele frequency change) with system-specific simulations to identify loci inconsistent with neutral evolution. We apply this to a genome-wide SNP set from an ideally suited study organism, the intertidal snail Littorina saxatilis, which shows primary divergence between ecotypes associated with different shore habitats. We detect many SNPs with clinal patterns, most of which are consistent with neutrality. Among non-neutral SNPs, most are located within three large putative inversions differentiating ecotypes. Many non-neutral SNPs show relatively low levels of differentiation. We discuss potential reasons for this pattern, including loose linkage to selected variants, polygenic adaptation and a component of balancing selection within populations (which may be expected for inversions). Our work is in line with theory predicting a role for inversions in divergence, and emphasizes that genomic regions contributing to divergence may not always be accessible with methods purely based on allele frequency differences. These conclusions call for approaches that take spatial patterns of allele frequency change into account in other systems.",2018,"clines; hybrid zones; inversions; local adaptation; molluscs; speciation","Article","ISI"

This simplification opens RADseq to any lab with the ability to extract DNA and perform a restriction digest. ezRAD also differs from others in its flexibility to use any restriction enzyme (or combination of enzymes) that cuts frequently enough to generate fragments of the desired size range, without requiring the purchase of separate adapters for each enzyme or a sonication step, which can further decrease the cost involved in choosing optimal enzymes for particular species and research questions. We apply this method across a wide taxonomic diversity of non-model organisms to demonstrate the utility and flexibility of our approach.

Given that the Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) is often the only fish species inhabiting these ecosystems, it represents a valuable model for studying the impacts of climate change on species life-history diversity and adaptability. Using a genotyping-by-sequencing approach, we identified 5,976 neutral single nucleotide polymorphisms and found evidence for reduced gene flow between allopatric morphs from two high Arctic lakes, Linne'vatn (Anadromous, Normal, and Dwarf) and EllasjOen (Littoral and Pelagic). Within each lake, the degree of genetic differentiation ranged from low (Pelagic vs. Littoral) to moderate (Anadromous and Normal vs. Dwarf). We identified 17 highly diagnostic, putatively adaptive SNPs that differentiated the allopatric morphs. Although we found no evidence for adaptive differences between morphs within EllasjOen, we found evidence for moderate (Anadromous vs. Normal) to high genetic differentiation (Anadromous and Normal vs. Dwarf) among morphs within Linne'vatn based on two adaptive loci. As these freshwater ecosystems become more productive, the frequency of sympatric morphs in EllasjOen will likely shift based on foraging opportunities, whereas the propensity to migrate may decrease in Linne'vatn, increasing the frequency of the Normal morph. The Dwarf charr was the most genetically distinct group. Identifying the biological basis for small body size should elucidate the potential for increased growth and subsequent interbreeding with sympatric morphs. Overall, neutral and adaptive genomic differentiation between allopatric and some sympatric morphs suggests that the response of Arctic charr to climate change will be variable across freshwater ecosystems.",2019,"arctic charr; climate change; genotyping-by-sequencing; population genomics; salmonids; svalbard","Article","ISI"

Habitat-related adaptive divergence of these traits is therefore common among animals. We studied the genomic architecture of habitat-related divergence in the body shape of Gnathopogon fishes, a novel example of lake-stream ecomorphological divergence, and tested for the action of directional selection on body shape differentiation. Compared to stream-dwelling Gnathopogon elongatus, the sister species Gnathopogon caerulescens, exclusively inhabiting a large ancient lake, had an elongated body, increased proportion of the caudal region and small head, which would be advantageous in the limnetic environment. Using an F-2 interspecific cross between the two Gnathopogon species (195 individuals), quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis with geometric morphometric quantification of body shape and restriction-site associated DNA sequencing-derived markers (1622 loci) identified 26 significant QTLs associated with the interspecific differences of body shape-related traits. These QTLs had small to moderate effects, supporting polygenic inheritance of the body shape-related traits. Each QTL was mostly located on different genomic regions, while colocalized QTLs were detected for some ecomorphologically relevant traits that are proxy of body and caudal peduncle depths, suggesting different degree of modularity among traits. The directions of the body shape QTLs were mostly consistent with the interspecific difference, and QTL sign test suggested a genetic signature of directional selection in the body shape divergence.

"Transcriptome-wide polymorphisms of red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) reveal patterns of gene flow and local adaptation","10.1111/mec.12081","De Wit, P; Palumbi, SR","Global climate change is projected to accelerate during the next century, altering oceanic patterns in temperature, pH and oxygen concentrations. Documenting patterns of genetic adaptation to these variables in locations that currently experience geographic variation in them is an important tool in understanding the potential for natural selection to allow populations to adapt as climate change proceeds. We sequenced the mantle transcriptome of 39 red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) individuals from three regions (Monterey Bay, Sonoma, north of Cape Mendocino) distinct in temperature, aragonite saturation, exposure to hypoxia and disease pressure along the California coast. Among 1.17x106 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in this study (1.37% of the transcriptome), 21579 could be genotyped for all individuals. A principal components analysis concluded that the vast majority of SNPs show no population structure from Monterey, California to the Oregon border, in corroboration with several previous studies. In contrast, an FST outlier analysis indicated 691 SNPs as exhibiting significantly higher than expected differentiation (experiment-wide P<0.05). From these, it was possible to identify 163 genes through BLAST annotation, 34 of which contained more than one outlier SNP. A large number of these genes are involved in biomineralization, energy metabolism, heat-, disease- or hypoxia-tolerance. These genes are candidate loci for spatial adaptation to geographic variation that is likely to increase in the future.",2013,"climate change; gene flow; local adaptation; ocean acidification; population structure; rna-seq; single nucleotide polymorphism discovery; transcriptome","Article","ISI"
"Genome scan of the mitten crab Eriocheir sensu stricto in East Asia: Population differentiation, hybridization and adaptive speciation","10.1016/j.ympev.2012.03.009","Xu, JW; Chu, KH","We examine the genetic structure and evolutionary history of the mitten crab Eriocheir sensu stricto in East Asia by employing a genome scan - amplified fragment length polymorphism. Population analysis reveals three divergent clades in Eriocheir s. s., which dominate the East China Sea-Yellow Sea, the Sea of Japan (plus Okinawa) and the South China Sea, respectively, mostly in agreement with our previous mtDNA analysis. With the tropical South China Sea inferred as the origin, the East China Sea-Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan clades in the north diverged successively from the ancestral clade during the mid-Pleistocene. The divergence of the three clades likely resulted from isolation of the three marginal seas caused by sea level change in the Pleistocene. Two sympatric zones, one of the East China Sea-Yellow Sea and the South China Sea clades in southeast China and the other of the East China Sea-Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan clades in Vladivostok, are demonstrated to be hybrid zones, with hybridization occurring currently in the former but historically in the latter. Adaptive speciation is observed in the divergence process of the three clades, possibly because of selection from accumulated temperature. Our study indicates that the genetic structure and evolutionary history of Eriocheir s. s. have been primarily affected by Pleistocene glacial cycles, secondarily by divergent selection and drainage isolation, but only minimally by human activities.

"Niche divergence along a fine-scale ecological gradient in sympatric color morphs of a coral reef fish","10.1002/ecs2.2015","Whitney, JL; Donahue, MJ; Karl, SA","Color polymorphisms offer unique opportunities for testing the role of ecological adaptation and natural selection in the origin of species. However, the ecological conditions that facilitate the coexistence and speciation of color morphs in nature remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the ecological mechanisms maintaining the color polymorphism in the arc-eye hawkfish (Paracirrhites arcatus), which consists of two common morphs (pink white-striped [PWS] and melanistic [MEL]) and less common intermediates that all coexist on shallow coral reefs throughout the Indo-Pacific. Our approach was to test whether ecologically based disruptive selection on color could explain the maintenance of and possible incipient divergence between sympatric color morphs. We compared patterns of spatial distribution, abundance, habitat use and preference, and niche overlap among color morphs at nine sites along the leeward coast of Hawaii Island. We demonstrate that despite co-occurring at all sites, sympatric color morphs show significant niche divergence along a steep ecological gradient. Morph frequencies correlate strongly with a multivariate gradient in coral community and reef topography, which explained 81% of the variability in relative abundance of the two main color morphs. Melanistic morphs were more frequent in shallow, steep surge zones dominated by Pocillopora corals. In contrast, PWS morphs were more frequent in deeper, sub-surge zones with higher coral cover dominated by Porites corals. Niche overlap analyses highlight how the two main morphs are partitioned on opposite ends of this continuous ecological gradient, while phenotypic intermediates are mostly restricted to intermediate habitats. The strong correlation between phenotype and environment suggests that morphs have fitness advantages in their respective habitats. We speculate that disruptive natural selection on color pattern to increase crypsis in heterogeneous visual environments has led to divergence in habitat preferences. The resulting ecological isolation provides a plausible mechanism for the persistence of multiple coexisting color phenotypes in P. arcatus. If divergence in color also affects mate choice, the evolution of reproductive isolation is likely to be promoted.",2018,"color polymorphism; coral reef fish; disruptive selection; ecological speciation; local adaptation; microhabitat; niche partitioning; sympatry","Article","ISI"

As such, patterns of adaptation and acclimatization of reef-building corals are integral to predictions of the future of coral reefs under climate warming. The common brooding coral, Pocillopora damicornis, exhibits extensive differences in host genetic and microbial symbiont community composition between depth habitats at Heron Island in the southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia. An 18-month reciprocal field transplant experiment was undertaken to examine the environmental and genetic drivers behind variation in survival, weight gain, heat tolerance and algal symbiont community between the reef flat and slope habitats. We observed population-by-habitat interactions for in situ partial mortality and weight gain, where trait-related fitness of natives was greater than transplants in most cases, consistent with local adaptation. On average, flat colonies transplanted to the slope had a relatively low partial mortality but minimal weight gain, whereas slope colonies transplanted to the flat had relatively high partial mortality and average weight gain. Experimental heat tolerance was always higher in colonies sourced from the flat, but increased when slope colonies were transplanted to the flat, providing evidence of acclimatization in these colonies. The performance of certain slope to flat transplants may have been driven by each colony's algal symbiont (Symbiodiniaceae) community, and flat variants were observed in a small number of slope colonies that either had a fixed flat composition before transplantation or shuffled after transplantation. Host genotypes of previously identified genetic outlier loci could not predict survival following transplantation, possibly because of low sample size and/or polygenic basis to the traits examined. Local environmental conditions and Symbiodiniaceae composition may provide insight into the adaptive potential to changing environmental conditions.",2021,"population-by-habitat interaction; local adaptation; acclimatization; reciprocal transplant; pocillopora damicornis; trait-related fitness","Article","ISI"

Recently, a novel mutation in the sodium channel in A. hudsonica was hypothesized to be the mechanism of adaptation to toxic Alexandrium; all copepods express both types of sodium channels. We tested the hypothesis that mutant sodium channel expression in A. hudsonica individuals corresponded to historical co-exposure to A. fundyense. Female A. hudsonica were sampled from historically exposed (Maine) and naive (Connecticut and New Jersey) populations to A. fundyense, throughout the 2011 season of growth of A. hudsonica. There were no consistent differences in wild-type: mutant isoform ratios nor in the relative abundance of individuals that predominately express one type of isoform, either through time within a population or among populations or over time within each location. We also tested the hypothesis that expression of the mutant sodium channel isoform in A. hudsonica should increase during the progression of a toxic Alexandrium bloom. Sodium channel expression was compared before, during, and after the 2011 toxic Alexandrium spp. bloom in Northport Harbor, NY. Moreover, the relative expression of the mutant isoform increased slightly after the peak of the toxic Alexandrium spp. bloom; however, there was no simultaneous increase in individuals that predominately express mutant channel isoforms. Overall, there was little evidence in support of our hypotheses. Other mechanisms must be responsible for the observed geographic differences in adaptation of copepods to toxic Alexandrium.

To fully understand the genetic mechanisms behind this process, the phylogeographic history of the species (inferred from neutral markers) as well as the loci under selection need to be known. Here we sequenced an intron in the arginine kinase gene (Ark), which shows strong clinal variation between two locally adapted ecotypes of the flat periwinkle, Littorina fabalis. The 'small-sheltered' ecotype was almost fixed for one haplotype, H1, in populations on both sides of the North Sea, unlike the 'large-moderately exposed ecotype', which segregated for ten different haplotypes. This contrasts with neutral markers, where the two ecotypes are equally variable. H1 could have been driven to high frequency in an ancestral population and then repeatedly spread to sheltered habitats due to local selection pressures with the colonization of both sides of the North Sea, after the last glacial maximum (similar to 18 000 years ago). An alternative explanation is that a positively selected mutation, in or linked to Ark, arose after the range expansion and secondarily spread through sheltered populations throughout the distribution range, causing this ecotype to evolve in a concerted fashion. Also, we were able to sequence up to four haplotypes consistently from some individuals, suggesting a gene duplication in Ark.

Genetic tools are commonly used for conservation and management of at-risk species. Individuals are often sampled from mixtures that are composed of many populations, which creates a need to assign individuals to their source. This can be problematic when the genetic divergence among source populations is weak but can be improved using adaptive genetic loci, which should show stronger levels of divergence. 2. We previously reported a signature of positive selection in the mitochondrial-encoded ND5 subunit of complex I in diverse taxa. The respiratory machinery of the mitochondria in salmonids is composed of more than 80 nuclear genes and there is substantial interaction between nuclear and mitochondrial expressed gene products. Recent studies report adaptive variation in mitochondrial function as well as co-evolution between mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. We used potentially adaptive ND5-based mitochondrial haplotypes to identify nuclear loci that would display increased levels of genetic divergence compared to neutral nuclear loci in chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta). Populations in a geographic area the size of France have previously demonstrated weak genetic divergence even after substantial discovery efforts by multiple laboratories for allozymes, microsatellites and SNPs over the last two decades. 3. We used RAD-based next-generation sequencing and identified a nuclear-encoded subunit of mitochondrial complex I that was a significant FST outlier and 14 other divergent nuclear markers that improve genetic assignment of individuals to their population of origin relative to assignments based on neutral markers alone. 4.

Differentiation of these ecotypes may involve both historical separation and adaptation to ecologically distinct environments, the genetic basis of which is now beginning to be unravelled. Genomic analyses based on recent sequencing advances are able to document genomic divergence in more detail and may facilitate the exploration of causes and consequences of genome-wide patterns. We examined genomic divergence between the stationary and migratory types of cod in the Northeast Atlantic, using next-generation sequencing of pooled DNA from each of two population samples. Sequence data was mapped to the published cod genome sequence, arranged in more than 6000 scaffolds (611Mb). We identified 25 divergent scaffolds (26Mb) with a higher than average gene density, against a backdrop of overall moderate genomic differentiation. Previous findings of localized genomic divergence in three linkage groups were confirmed, including a large (15Mb) genomic region, which seems to be uniquely involved in the divergence of migratory and stationary cod.

The intertidal mussel Perna perna consists of two distinct genetic lineages in South Africa, but the mechanisms maintaining these lineages remains obscure. We used regional oceanography and lineage-specific responses to environmental conditions as proxies for gene flow and local selection, respectively, to test how these mechanisms could shape population genetic structure. Laboratory experiments supported the field findings that mussels on the east coast (eastern lineage) are physiologically more tolerant of sand inundation and high temperatures than those on the south coast (western lineage). Temperature loggers mimicking mussel body temperatures revealed that mussels experience higher body temperatures during aerial exposure on the subtropical east coast than on the temperate south coast. Translocations showed that, on the east coast, the western lineage suffered higher mortality rates than local individuals, while on the south coast, mortality rates did not differ significantly between the lineages. Nearshore drogues showed remarkably little overlap between the trajectories of drifters released off the south coast and those released off the east coast. Physiological tolerances can thus explain the exclusion of western individuals from the east coast, but they cannot explain the exclusion of the eastern lineage from the south coast. In contrast, however, ocean dynamics may limit larval dispersal between the two lineages, helping to explain the absence of eastern individuals from the south coast. We emphasise the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in a macro-ecological context to understand fully the mechanisms promoting evolutionary divergence between genetic entities. Our results suggest that phylogeographic patterns of Perna perna may be maintained by a combination of local conditions and the isolating effect of the Agulhas Current that reduces gene exchange.",2011,"local adaptation; genetic entities; biogeographic region; gene flow; larval dispersal","Article","ISI"

Reptiles require relatively little energy, and their digestive system can readily respond to internal and external shifts. Ergo, reptiles can colonize even demanding habitats by improving digestive performance. Although many studies address lizard digestion, few examine geographical variation. Here, we examine how the digestion of a single lizard species (Stellagama stellio) differs along a latitudinal and climatic gradient, comprising mainland and insular populations. Apparent digestive efficiency (ADE, the percentage of ingested energy absorbed through the gut) for lipids, proteins and sugars was used to answer the main question: is digestive performance consistent across populations (one species, one pattern) or is it dependent on habitat features (different populations, different patterns). We expected that climate and insularity would affect ADE. Indeed, the northernmost populations, inhabiting colder, rainier, less seasonal regions, achieved the lower ADEs. Insularity, however, had no effect on digestive efficiency, indicating that insular (or mainland) habitats are not all the same and local particularities may play a role. These findings suggest that each population adjusts its physiological repertoire to the local conditions.",2017,"evolutionary physiology; insularity; local adaptations; stellagama","Article","ISI"

Physical tagging data suggest that Albacore from the North and South Pacific Ocean are separate stocks, but results from previous genetic studies did not support this two stock hypothesis. In addition, observed biological differences among juveniles suggest that there may be population substructure in the North Pacific. We used double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing to assess population structure among 308 Albacore caught in 12 sample areas across the Pacific Ocean (10 North, 2 South). Since Albacore are highly migratory and spawning areas are unknown, sample groups were not assumed to be equivalent to populations and the genetic data were analyzed iteratively. We tested for putatively adaptive differences among groups and for genetic variation associated with sex. Results indicated that Albacore in the North and South Pacific can be distinguished using 84 putatively adaptive loci, but not using the remaining 12,788 presumed neutral sites. However, two individuals likely represent F1 hybrids between the North and South Pacific populations, and 43 Albacore potentially exhibit lower degrees of mixed ancestry. In addition, four or five cross-hemisphere migrants were potentially identified. No genetic evidence was found for population substructure within the North Pacific, and no loci appeared to distinguish males from females. Potential functions for the putatively adaptive loci were identified, but an annotated Albacore genome is required for further exploration.

The sites have different salinity regimes and we tested whether crabs were adapted to their site locally or whether they showed phenotypic plasticity. The upper reach had a low salinity (similar to 16) during low tide, unlike the other two sites (similar to 28-31). The exposure of crabs from each site to seven different salinity levels (0-52.5) showed that P. minutus is a hyper-hypo-osmoregulator at all sites and is able to survive in 8.75-52.5 salinity levels for 24 h. Crabs from the upper reach, however, maintained greater hemolymph osmolarity in diluted media, and most of them were able to survive in even 0 salinity medium for 24 h. Crabs from the other two sites were not able to tolerate this condition and all died. Another experiment, involving a 1-wk acclimation to 5 decreasing salinity media (35 to 0), showed that the survival was about 1.3 times greater for crabs from the upper reach than from the other two sites. Because the crab density of the upper reach was significantly less than that of the other two sites, the upper reach is a marginal habitat established by asymmetrical larval dispersal from central saline habitats. Nevertheless, no crab from the saline sites survived exposure to the salinity of zero medium. These results suggest that the high osmoregulatory ability of crabs from the upper reach of the estuary does not represent a local adaptation; crabs acquire it after dispersal through developmental plasticity.",2014,"developmental plasticity; local adaptation; osmoregulation; phenotypic plasticity; pagurus minutus","Article","ISI"

We found that samples from within a river system were more genetically similar to each other regardless of life history type or sampling location than they were to similar types from other rivers. Rainbow trout samples had lower genetic diversity then steelhead samples. We identified two main population groups among the steelhead samples.

Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) exhibit extensive phenotypic plasticity that supports large population sizes in highly fluctuating estuarine environments. Populations have also evolved diverse local adaptations. To yield insights into the genomic variation that supports their adaptability, we sequenced a reference genome and 48 additional whole genomes from a wild population. Evolution of genes associated with cell cycle regulation and apoptosis is accelerated along the killifish lineage, which is likely tied to adaptations for life in highly variable estuarine environments. Genome-wide standing genetic variation, including nucleotide diversity and copy number variation, is extremely high. The highest diversity genes are those associated with immune function and olfaction, whereas genes under greatest evolutionary constraint are those associated with neurological, developmental, and cytoskeletal functions. Reduced genetic variation is detected for tight junction proteins, which in killifish regulate paracellular permeability that supports their extreme physiological flexibility. Low-diversity genes engage in more regulatory interactions than high-diversity genes, consistent with the influence of pleiotropic constraint on molecular evolution. High genetic variation is crucial for continued persistence of species given the pace of contemporary environmental change. Killifish populations harbor among the highest levels of nucleotide diversity yet reported for a vertebrate species, and thus may serve as a useful model system for studying evolutionary potential in variable and changing environments.",2017,"population genomics; genome sequence; comparative genomics; adaptation; genetic diversity","Article","ISI"
"Plasticity matches phenotype to local conditions despite genetic homogeneity across 13 snake populations","10.1098/rspb.2020.2916","Bonnet, X; Brischoux, F; Briand, M; Shine, R","In a widespread species, a matching of phenotypic traits to local environmental optima is generally attributed to site-specific adaptation. However, the same matching can occur via adaptive plasticity, without requiring genetic differences among populations. Adult sea kraits (Laticauda saintgironsi) are highly philopatric to small islands, but the entire population within the Neo-Caledonian Lagoon is genetically homogeneous because females migrate to the mainland to lay their eggs at communal sites; recruits disperse before settling, mixing up alleles. Consequently, any matching between local environments (e.g. prey sizes) and snake phenotypes (e.g. body sizes and relative jaw sizes (RJSs)) must be achieved via phenotypic plasticity rather than spatial heterogeneity in gene frequencies. We sampled 13 snake colonies spread along an approximately 200 km northwest-southeast gradient (n > 4500 individuals) to measure two morphological features that affect maximum ingestible prey size in gape-limited predators: body size and RJS. As proxies of habitat quality (HQ), we used protection status, fishing pressure and lagoon characteristics (lagoon width and distance of islands to the barrier reef). In both sexes, spatial variation in body sizes and RJSs was linked to HQ; albeit in different ways, consistent with sex-based divergences in foraging ecology. Strong spatial divergence in morphology among snake colonies, despite genetic homogeneity, supports the idea that phenotypic plasticity can facilitate speciation by creating multiple phenotypically distinct subpopulations shaped by their environment.",2021,"gape limited; jaw size; laticauda; local adaptation; new caledonia; sea krait","Article","ISI"

Short-term measures of metabolic responses to warmer environments are expected to indicate the sensitivity of species to regional warming.

The tropical reef fish Acanthochromis polyacanthus was used to test whether the ability for developmental thermal acclimation of two populations was indicated by their short-term metabolic response to temperature. 3. While both populations exhibited similar short-term responses of resting metabolic rate (RMR) to temperature, fish from the higher-latitude population were able to fully acclimate RMR, while the lower-latitude population could only partially compensate RMR at the warmest temperature. These differences in acclimation ability are most likely due to genetic differences between the populations rather than differences in thermal regimes. 4. This research indicates that acclimation ability may vary greatly between populations and that understanding such variation will be critical for predicting the impacts of warming environmental temperatures. Moreover, the thermal metabolic reaction norm does not appear to be a good predictor of long-term acclimation ability.",2012,"acclimation; climate change; coral reef fish; global warming; local adaptation; metabolism; phenotypic plasticity","Article","ISI"

The European whitefish, Coregonus lavaretus, is a widely distributed salmonid fish species on mainland Europe, but in Britain it has only seven native populations, all of which are found on the western extremes of the island. The origins and colonization routes of the species into Britain are unknown but likely contributed to contemporary genetic patterns and regional uniqueness. Here, we used up to 25,751 genome-wide polymorphic loci to reconstruct the history and to discern the demographic and evolutionary forces underpinning divergence between British populations. Overall, we found lower genetic diversity in Scottish populations but high differentiation (F-ST = 0.433-0.712) from the English/Welsh and other European populations. Differentiation was elevated genome-wide rather than in particular genomic regions. Demographic modelling supported a postglacial colonization into western Scotland from northern refugia and a separate colonization route for the English/Welsh populations from southern refugia, with these two groups having been separated for more than ca. 50 Ky. We found cyto-nuclear discordance at a European scale, with the Scottish populations clustering closely with Baltic population in the mtDNA analysis but not in the nuclear data, and with the Norwegian and Alpine populations displaying the same mtDNA haplotype but being distantly related in the nuclear tree. These findings suggest that neutral processes, primarily drift and regionally distinct pre-glacial evolutionary histories, are important drivers of genomic divergence in British populations of European whitefish.

In endangered species, adaptive potential may be eroded by decreased population sizes and processes that further reduce gene flow such as philopatry and local adaptations. Here, we focused on the philopatric and endangered loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) nesting in Cape Verde as a model system to investigate the link between adaptive potential and philopatry. We produced a dataset of three complementary genomic regions to investigate female philopatric behaviour (mitochondrial DNA), male-mediated gene flow (microsatellites) and adaptive potential (major histocompatibility complex, MHC). Results revealed genetically distinct nesting colonies, indicating remarkably small-scale philopatric behaviour of females. Furthermore, these colonies also harboured local pools of MHC alleles, especially at the margins of the population's distribution, which are therefore important reserves of additional diversity for the population. Meanwhile, directional male-mediated gene flow from the margins of distribution sustains the adaptive potential for the entire rookery.

This study uses population genomics to examine patterns of genetic structure of the market squid (Doryteuthis opalescens), one of the most important commercially harvested species in California. Data from 662 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci from a total of 149 individuals representing five monthly sampling groups (May-September 2014) in the Northern (Monterey) and Southern (Southern California) regions of the fishery (n = 8) revealed no significant genetic differentiation between regions (FST = 0.008, p > 0.05, FCT = - 0.006, p > 0.05). However, discriminant analysis of principal components and pairwise comparisons of genetic differentiation revealed unexpected complex patterns of fine-scale population structure over time. These results suggest the existence of smaller potentially genetically varied micro-cohorts that continually spawn in California, as opposed to the prevailing notion that spawning occurs in two asynchronous peaks in the Northern and Southern regions of the fishery, with important implications for fisheries management.",2021,"population genomics; fisheries; squid; connectivity; doryteuthis opalescens","Article","ISI"
"Conservation genomics of a critically endangered brown seaweed","10.1111/jpy.13177","Mamo, LT; Wood, G; Wheeler, D; Kelaher, BP; Coleman, MA","Seaweeds provide valuable ecosystem services, but many are undergoing global decline due to climate and anthropogenic stressors. The brown macroalga, Nereia lophocladia (hereafter called Nereia), is among only a handful of seaweeds globally to be listed as critically endangered and is only described from two known locations, but there exists little knowledge about this species. Here, we combine field surveys to verify the distribution of Nereia, with cutting-edge genomics to determine genetic diversity and population structure, and inform ongoing conservation actions. We expand Nereia's known distribution from one to seven locations along a 70-km long coastal stretch in New South Wales but reveal small population sizes at some sites (as few as 8 individuals despite extensive searching). A total of 1,261 genome-wide SNPs were retained from 70 individuals after filtering, and 304 outlier loci under putative selection were detected by one of three methods. Populations showed low genetic diversity (mean expected heterozygosity H-E = 0.055 +/- 0.014) and high levels of inbreeding within populations (mean F-IS = 0.721 +/- 0.085), along with high genetic differentiation among sites (mean F-ST = 0.276), which may increase susceptibility to future environmental change and decrease the species' ability to recover after loss. Given these findings, we recommend the consideration of both in situ and ex situ conservation measures for Nereia, as well as further research into the species' ecology and biology. Nereia remains of conservation concern and its listing as critically endangered is justified until further investigation elucidates the full distribution and adaptive capacity of the species.",2021,"conservation genetics; dartseq; genomics; inbreeding; nereia lophocladia; population structure; threatened species","Article","ISI"

We investigated the presence of coevolution between the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium minutum and two naturally occurring endoparasites during blooms lasting a month in two river estuaries, using cross-inoculation experiments across time and space. Higher parasite abundance was associated with a large daily reduction in relative A. minutum abundances, demonstrating strong parasite-mediated selection. There was genetic variability in infectivity in both parasite species, and in resistance in the host. We found no evidence for coevolution in one estuary; however, in the other estuary, we found high genetic diversity in the two parasite species, fluctuations in infectivity and suggestion that the two parasites are well adapted to their host, as in 'Red Queen' dynamics. Thus, coevolution is possible over the short time span of a bloom, but geographically variable, and may feedback on community dynamics.",2016,"coevolution; harmful algal bloom; dinoflagellate; red queen; local adaptation; time-shift experiment","Article","ISI"

The optimal parameter settings for a given de novo RADseq assembly vary between data sets and can be difficult and computationally expensive to determine. Here, we introduce RADProc, a software package that uses a graph data structure to represent all sequence reads and their similarity relationships. Storing sequence-comparison results in a graph eliminates unnecessary and redundant sequence similarity calculations. De novo locus formation for a given parameter set can be performed on the precomputed graph, making parameter sweeps far more efficient. RADProc also uses a clustering approach for faster nucleotide-distance calculation. The performance of RADProc compares favourably with that of the widely used Stacks software. The run-time comparisons between RADProc and Stacks for 32 different parameter settings using 20 green-crab (Carcinus maenas) samples showed that RADProc took as little as 2 hr 40 min compared to 78 hr by Stacks, while 16 brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) samples were processed by RADProc and Stacks in 23 and 263 hr, respectively.

"The Genetic Architecture of Fitness Drives Population Viability during Rapid Environmental Change","10.1086/713469","Kardos, M; Luikart, G","The rapid global loss of biodiversity calls for improved predictions of how populations will evolve and respond demographically to ongoing environmental change. The heritability (h(2)) of selected traits has long been known to affect evolutionary and demographic responses to environmental change. However, effects of the genetic architecture underlying the h(2) of a selected trait on population responses to selection are less well understood. We use deterministic models and stochastic simulations to show that the genetic architecture underlying h(2) can dramatically affect population viability during environmental change. Polygenic trait architectures (many loci, each with a small phenotypic effect) conferred higher population viability than genetic architectures with the same initial h(2) and large-effect loci under a wide range of scenarios. Population viability also depended strongly on the initial frequency of large-effect beneficial alleles, with moderately low initial allele frequencies conferring higher viability than rare or already-frequent large-effect alleles. Greater population viability associated with polygenic architectures appears to be due to higher short-term evolutionary potential compared with architectures with large-effect loci. These results suggest that integrating information on the trait genetic architecture into quantitative genetic and population viability analysis will substantially improve our understanding and prediction of evolutionary and demographic responses following environmental change.",2021,"adaptation; conservation genomics; extinction; natural selection; population dynamics; quantitative genetics","Article","ISI"

We used genetically divergent populations of the copepod Tigriopus californicus, whose performance at different thermal conditions is well characterized, to investigate transcriptome-wide expression responses under two different thermal regimes: (1) a nonvariable temperature regime and (2) a regime with variable temperature. Our results show the expression profiles of the response to these regimes differed substantially among populations, even for populations that are geographically close. This pattern was accentuated when populations were raised in the variable temperature environment. Less heat-tolerant populations mounted strong but divergent responses to the different thermal regimes, with a large heat-shock response observed in one population, and an apparent reduction in the expression of genes involved in basic cellular processes in the other.

For example, local adaptation, a particular type of genetic by environmental (G*E) interaction in which the fitness of a population in its own habitat is greater than in other habitats, is often invoked in management practices, even in the absence of supporting evidence. Despite increasing attention to the potential for G*E interactions, few studies have tested multiple populations and environments simultaneously, limiting our understanding of the spatial consistency in patterns of adaptive genetic variation. In addition, few studies explicitly differentiate adaptation in response to predation from other biological and environmental factors. We conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment of first-generation eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) juveniles from six populations across three field sites spanning 1000 km in the southeastern Atlantic Bight in both the presence and absence of predation to test for G*E variation in this economically valuable and ecologically important species. We documented significant G*E variation in survival and growth, yet there was no evidence for local adaptation. Condition varied across oyster cohorts: Offspring of northern populations had better condition than offspring from the center of our region. Oyster populations in the southeastern Atlantic Bight differ in juvenile survival, growth, and condition, yet offspring from local broodstock do not have higher survival or growth than those from farther away.

Here, we evaluated genetic population structure in lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus), a commercially and recreationally important fishery species along the west coast of North America. We used 16,749 restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) markers, in 611 individuals collected from across the bulk of the species range from Southeast Alaska to Baja California, Mexico. In contrast to previous population genetic work on this species, we found strong evidence for two distinct genetic clusters. These groups separated latitudinally with a break near Point Reyes off Northern California, and there was a high frequency of admixed individuals in close proximity to the break. F-statistics corroborate this genetic break between northern and southern sampling sites, although most loci are characterized by low F(ST)values, suggesting high gene flow throughout most of the genome. Outlier analyses identified 182 loci putatively under divergent selection, most of which mapped to a single genomic region. When individuals were grouped by cluster assignment (northern, southern, and admixed), 71 loci were fixed between the northern and southern cluster, all of which were identified in the outlier scans. All individuals identified as admixed exhibited near 50:50 assignment to northern and southern clusters and were heterozygous for most fixed loci. Alignments of RADseq loci to a draft lingcod genome assembly and three other teleost genomes with chromosome-level assemblies suggest that outlier and fixed loci are concentrated on a single chromosome. Similar genomic patterns have been attributed to chromosomal inversions in diverse taxonomic groups. Regardless of the evolutionary mechanism, these results represent novel observations of genetic structure in lingcod and designate clear evolutionary units that could be used to inform fisheries management.",2020,"fisheries management; heterogeneous genomic divergence; latitudinal cline; northeast pacific ocean; population genomics; rad sequencing","Article","ISI"

Both species are at a high risk of being negatively affected by climate change. Here, we provide a resource of 38 240 RAD-tags and 52 981 nuclear SNPs shared between both species. We have estimated overall higher levels of nucleotide diversity in white-sided (pi = 0.0492 +/- 0.0006%) than in white-beaked dolphins (pi = 0.0300 +/- 0.0004%).

This is particularly critical for widely distributed and highly mobile deep-water teleosts, such as hoki (Macruronus novaezelandiae). This species is significant to Maori people and supports the largest commercial fishery in New Zealand, but uncertainty about its stock structure presents a challenge for management. Here, we apply a comprehensive genomic analysis to shed light on the demographic structure of this species by (1) assembling the genome, (2) generating a catalogue of genome-wide SNPs to infer the stock structure and (3) identifying regions of the genome under selection. The final genome assembly used short and long reads and is near complete, representing 93.8% of BUSCO genes, and consisting of 566 contigs totalling 501 Mb. Whole-genome re-sequencing of 510 hoki sampled from 14 locations around New Zealand and Australia, at a read depth greater than 10x, produced 227,490 filtered SNPs. Analyses of these SNPs were able to resolve the stock structure of hoki into two genetically and geographically distinct clusters, one including the Australian and the other one all New Zealand locations, indicating genetic exchange between these regions is limited. Location differences within New Zealand samples were much more subtle (global F-ST = 0.0006), and while small and significant differences could be detected, they did not conclusively identify additional substructures. Ten putative adaptive SNPs were detected within the New Zealand samples, but these also did not geographically partition the dataset further. Contemporary and historical N-e estimation suggest the current New Zealand population of hoki is large yet declining.

This is well illustrated by the solitary tunicate, Ciona robusta, native to the North East Pacific and introduced in the North East Atlantic. It is now co-occurring with its congener Ciona intestinalis in the English Channel, and C. roulei in the Mediterranean Sea. Despite their long allopatric divergence, first and second generation crosses showed a high hybridization success between the introduced and native taxa in the laboratory. However, previous genetic studies failed to provide evidence of recent hybridization between C. robusta and C. intestinalis in the wild. Using SNPs obtained from ddRAD-sequencing of 397 individuals from 26 populations, we further explored the genome-wide population structure of the native Ciona taxa. We first confirmed results documented in previous studies, notably (i) a chaotic genetic structure at regional scale, and (ii) a high genetic similarity between C. roulei and C. intestinalis, which is calling for further taxonomic investigation. More importantly, and unexpectedly, we also observed a genomic hotspot of long introgressed C. robusta tracts into C. intestinalis genomes at several locations of their contact zone. Both the genomic architecture of introgression, restricted to a 1.5 Mb region of chromosome 5, and its absence in allopatric populations suggest introgression is recent and occurred after the introduction of the non-native species.

"Variation in Thermal Tolerance and Its Relationship to Mitochondrial Function Across Populations of Tigriopus californicus","10.3389/fphys.2019.00213","Harada, AE; Healy, TM; Burton, RS","Variation in thermal tolerance plays a key role in determining the biogeographic distribution of organisms. Consequently, identifying the mechanistic basis for thermal tolerance is necessary for understanding not only current species range limits but also the capacity for range limits to shift in response to climate change. Although variation in mitochondrial function likely contributes to variation in thermal tolerance, the extent to which mitochondrial function underlies local thermal adaptation is not fully understood. In the current study, we examine variation in thermal tolerance and mitochondrial function among three populations of the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus found across a latitudinal thermal gradient along the coast of California, USA. We tested (1) acute thermal tolerance using survivorship and knockdown assays, (2) chronic thermal tolerance using survivorship of nauplii and developmental rate, and (3) mitochondrial performance at a range of temperatures using ATP synthesis fueled by complexes I, II, and I&II, as well as respiration of permeabilized fibers. We find evidence for latitudinal thermal adaptation: the southernmost San Diego population outperforms the northernmost Santa Cruz in measures of survivorship, knockdown temperature, and ATP synthesis rates during acute thermal exposures. However, under a chronic thermal regime, survivorship and developmental rate are more similar in the southernmost and northernmost population than in the mid-range population (Abalone Cove). Though this pattern is unexpected, it aligns well with population-specific rates of ATP synthesis at these chronic temperatures. Combined with the tight correlation of ATP synthesis decline and knockdown temperature, these data suggest a role for mitochondria in setting thermal range limits and indicate that divergence in mitochondrial function is likely a component of adaptation across latitudinal thermal gradients.",2019,"local adaptation; atp synthesis; intertidal; timescale; ectotherm; copepod; latitudinal gradient","Article","ISI"

The chaetognath species Spadella cephaloptera offers a unique perspective to examine this issue because they display a high level of genetic polymorphism at the population level. Here, we have investigated in detail the extent of nucleotide and structural polymorphism in a region harboring Hox1 and several coding genes and presumptive functional elements. Sequencing of several bacterial artificial chromosome inserts representative of this nuclear region uncovered a high level of structural heterogeneity, which is mainly caused by the polymorphic insertion of a diversity of genetic mobile elements. By anchoring this variation through individual genotyping, we demonstrated that sequence diversity could be attributed to the allelic pool of a single population, which was confirmed by detection of extensive recombination within the genomic region studied. The high average level of nucleotide heterozygosity provides clues of selection in both coding and noncoding domains. This pattern stresses how selective processes remarkably cope with intense sequence turnover due to substitutions, mobile element insertions, and recombination to preserve the integrity of functional landscape. These findings suggest that genome polymorphism could provide pivotal information for future functional annotation of genomes.",2010,"structural polymorphism; mobile elements; hox genes; population genomics; chaetognatha; metazoan evolution","Article","ISI"
"Local adaptation and embryonic plasticity affect antipredator traits in hatchling pond snails","10.1111/fwb.12512","Dalesman, S; Thomas, A; Rundle, SD","The biology of induced defences in very early life history stages is poorly understood in freshwater invertebrates, but may be equally, if not more, important than later stages in influencing population dynamics and survival. Here, we investigated how exposure of embryos of the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis to predator kairomones altered traits associated with protection (crawl out behaviour and shell size) in hatchling snails. We also investigated whether levels of plasticity were influenced by habitat of origin by comparing reaction norms from sites with different levels of predation risk: three high risk (predatory fish present) and three low risk (predatory fish absent). F2 embryos from snails from each population were exposed to kairomones from a predatory fish (Tinca tinca) or control conditions for their entire development up to the point of hatching. Their avoidance behaviour and size (spire height) were then measured 1day and 7days after hatching. One day post-hatching, levels of predator avoidance, primarily time spent at the water line, were significantly greater in high-risk versus low-risk populations; however, avoidance was also increased in hatchling snails exposed to predator cues as embryos, compared with those developing in control conditions. Snails exposed to predator cues during development were smaller, and there was a strong negative relationship between size and avoidance behaviour, suggesting a trade-off or trait compensation between growth and behaviour. At 7days post-hatching, a similar pattern in avoidance behaviour was found, with increased avoidance in snails from high-risk habitats and in those exposed to predator kairomones during their development. The primary avoidance response switched to crawling above the waterline at 7days post-hatching. There was no significant difference in shell size between treatments, suggesting that predator-exposed snails had exhibited catch-up' growth. This enhanced investment in growth between 1day and 7days post-hatching was positively correlated with elevated avoidance behaviour across treatment groups, demonstrating that snails switched to trait co-specialisation of defence traits. During the first few days post-hatching, snails alter the type of avoidance behaviour and also the relationship between morphological and behavioural defence traits. The degree of expression of these defensive traits in hatchling snails is influenced by both their developmental environment and local adaptation to their predation habitat that may have large implications for survival.",2015,"developmental plasticity; embryo; local adaptation; lymnaea stagnalis; predator","Article","ISI"

Starting with classical ecological studies, we identified a set of populations that had evolved population-specific phenotypic traits over a relatively short time span (10-30 generations). These observations led us into evolutionary studies at various levels of biological organization, using population and quantitative genetic, transcriptomic and proteomic approaches. Overall, the results show that the populations exhibit evolutionary responses to local-scale differences in environment (mainly water temperature during early development). Further, plastic responses are important in the early phase of population diversification. Population genomic studies are now becoming possible following the completion of an annotated genome. This will help us and others in addressing questions about the genetic architecture of traits important for local adaptation, thus emphasizing that combining ecological and evolutionary approaches is more important and interesting than ever.",2019,"adaptation; climate; ecology; genomics; grayling; population genetics; proteomics; thymallus thymallus; transcriptomics","Article","ISI"

River impoundments have also rapidly altered freshwater habitats, often resulting in species extirpation or extinction. The Coosa River in Alabama experienced one of the largest faunal declines in modern history after impoundment, making it an ideal system for studying how invertebrate species are affected by reservoir creation. One such species, the Rough Hornsnail, Pleurocera foremani, is an endangered freshwater snail in the family Pleuroceridae. We sampled all known localities of P foremani and used 2bRAD-seq to measure genetic diversity. We assessed riverscape genomic patterns across the current range of P foremani and measured gene flow within and between impoundments. We also investigated the degree to which P foremani displays an isolation by distance pattern and conforms to broad hypotheses that have been put forth for population genetics of riverine species like the Mighty Headwater Hypothesis that predicts greater genetic diversity in headwater reaches compared with mainstem populations. Like most other freshwater species, a pattern of isolation by distance was observed in P foremani.

Additionally, we found that spatial genetic structure of P foremani deviates from what is expected under the Mighty Headwaters Hypothesis, adding to a growing body of research suggesting that the majority of genetic diversity in low-dispersing gastropods is found in mainstem populations.",2021,"population genomics; pleurocerid; conservation; coosa river","Article","ISI"

The methods and massive marker sets present both new data analysis challenges and opportunities to visualize, understand, and apply population and conservation genomic data in novel ways. The large scale and complexity of NGS data also increases the expertise and effort required to thoroughly and thoughtfully analyze and interpret data. To aid in this endeavor, a recent workshop entitled Population Genomic Data Analysis, also known as ConGen 2017, was held at the University of Montana. The ConGen workshop brought 15 instructors together with knowledge in a wide range of topics including NGS data filtering, genome assembly, genomic monitoring of effective population size, migration modeling, detecting adaptive genomic variation, genomewide association analysis, inbreeding depression, and landscape genomics. Here, we summarize the major themes of the workshop and the important take-home points that were offered to students throughout. We emphasize increasing participation by women in population and conservation genomics as a vital step for the advancement of science. Some important themes that emerged during the workshop included the need for data visualization and its importance in finding problematic data, the effects of data filtering choices on downstream population genomic analyses, the increasing availability of whole-genome sequencing, and the new challenges it presents. Our goal here is to help motivate and educate a worldwide audience to improve population genomic data analysis and interpretation, and thereby advance the contribution of genomics to molecular ecology, evolutionary biology, and especially to the conservation of biodiversity.",2018,"bioinformatics pipeline; conservation genomics workshop; diversity in stem; landscape genomics; population genomics","Article","ISI"

Our goals were to describe the clinal variation between biogeographical areas, and between localities along the latitudinal gradient between 30 degrees and 54 degrees S. Specimens were collected from 12 localities throughout the entire geographical distribution range of the species. Geometric morphometric analyses were used to evaluate the morphological variation of A. monodon along the Chilean coast. Relative warps and centroid size scores were used to compare the shape and size and their morphological variation and similarity was evaluated through multivariate analyses between all populations. The first two relative warps explained 78% variance. Size and shape scores decreased southward showing high biogeographical and latitudinal variation, principally due to both the thickness of the lip and the spire length. Multivariate analyses showed two main morphotypes: northern populations with short spires, thick and smooth lips and robust shells; the other with longer spires, thinner ornamented lips and weak shells associated with southern populations. However, three southern populations showed a merging of characteristics from both morphotypes, which could correspond to an intermediate morphotype or a morphological transitional zone. The results suggest the existence of clinal variation along the southeastern Pacific coast showing two morphotypes to north and south of 41 degrees S, with a feature merging zone that probably extends to 45 degrees S, related to biogeographical areas proposed for the Chilean coast. We suggest that the morphotypes reported are the result of site-specific eco-phenotypes responding to local variation.",2012,"biogeography; chile; morphological changes; local adaptation; gastropods; south america; geometric morphometrics","Article","ISI"

Given only subtle allele frequency differences at most loci and the expectation that divergent selection may affect only a tiny fraction of the genome, distinguishing closely related species based on multi-locus data requires substantial genomic coverage. In this study, we used ddRAD-seq to sample the genomes of five recently diverged, New World mallards (Anas spp.), a group of dabbling duck species characterized by diagnosable phenotypic differences but minimal genetic differentiation. With increased genomic sampling, we aimed to characterize population structure within this group and identify genomic regions that may have experienced divergent selection during speciation. We analyzed 3,017 autosomal ddRAD-seq loci and 177 loci from the Z-chromosome. In contrast to previous studies, the ddRAD-seq data were sufficient to assign individuals to their respective species or subspecies and to generate estimates of gene flow in a phylogenetic framework. We find limited evidence of contemporary gene flow between the dichromatic mallard and several monochromatic taxa, but find evidence for historical gene flow between some monochromatic species pairs. We conclude that the overall genetic similarity of these taxa likely reflects retained ancestral polymorphism rather than recent and extensive gene flow. Thus, despite recurring cases of hybridization in this group, our results challenge the current dogma predicting the genetic extinction of the New World monochromatic dabbling ducks via introgressive hybridization with mallards. Moreover, ddRAD-seq data were sufficient to identify previously unknown outlier regions across the Z-chromosome and several autosomal chromosomes that may have been involved in the diversification of species in this recent radiation.",2019,"ddradseq; hybridization; introgression; population genomics; sex chromosome; speciation","Article","ISI"
"Migration-Selection Balance Drives Genetic Differentiation in Genes Associated with High-Altitude Function in the Speckled Teal (Anas flavirostris) in the Andes","10.1093/gbe/evx253","Graham, AM; Lavretsky, P; Munoz-Fuentes, V; Green, AJ; Wilson, RE; McCracken, KG","Local adaptation frequently occurs across populations as a result of migration-selection balance between divergent selective pressures and gene flow associated with life in heterogeneous landscapes. Studying the effects of selection and gene flow on the adaptation process can be achieved in systems that have recently colonized extreme environments. This study utilizes an endemic South American duck species, the speckled teal (Anas flavirostris), which has both high-and low-altitude populations. High-altitude speckled teal (A. f. oxyptera) are locally adapted to the Andean environment and mostly allopatric from low-altitude birds (A. f. flavirostris); however, there is occasional gene flow across altitudinal gradients. In this study, we used next-generation sequencing to explore genetic patterns associated with high-altitude adaptation in speckled teal populations, as well as the extent to which the balance between selection and migration have affected genetic architecture. We identified a set of loci with allele frequencies strongly correlated with altitude, including those involved in the insulin-like signaling pathway, bone morphogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation, responders to hypoxia-induced DNA damage, and feedback loops to the hypoxia-inducible factor pathway. These same outlier loci were found to have depressed gene flow estimates, as well as being highly concentrated on the Z-chromosome. Our results suggest a multifactorial response to life at high altitudes through an array of interconnected pathways that are likely under positive selection and whose genetic components seem to be providing an effective genomic barrier to interbreeding, potentially functioning as an avenue for population divergence and speciation.",2018,"local adaptation; hypoxia; waterfowl","Article","ISI"

Using replicated field mesocosms, stocked with second-generation lab-bred three-spined stickleback hybrids of a lake and a river population, we show local adaptation of MHC genotypes to population-specific parasites, independently of the genetic background. Increased allele divergence of lake MHC genotypes allows lake fish to fight the broad range of lake parasites, whereas more specific river genotypes confer selective advantages against the less diverse river parasites. Hybrids with local MHC genotype gained more body weight and thus higher fitness than those with foreign MHC in either habitat, suggesting the evolutionary significance of locally adapted MHC genotypes.",2012,"adaptive radiation; host-parasite coevolution; local adaptation; major histocompatibility complex","Article","ISI"

With a step-by-step workflow, we illustrate how lowcoverage whole-genome sequencing of hundreds of individually barcoded samples is now a practical alternative strategy for obtaining genomewide data on a population scale. We used a highly efficient protocol to generate high-quality libraries for similar to 6.5 USD from each of 876 Atlantic silversides (a teleost fish with a genome size similar to 730 Mb) that we sequenced to 1-4x genome coverage. In the absence of a reference genome, we developed a bioinformatic pipeline for mapping the genomic reads to a de novo assembled reference transcriptome. This provides an 'in silico' method for exome capture that avoids the complexities and expenses of using wet chemistry for target isolation. Using novel tools for analysis of low-coverage data, we extracted population allele frequencies, individual genotype likelihoods and polymorphism data for 2 504 335 SNPs across the exome for the 876 fish. To illustrate the use of the resulting data, we present a preliminary analysis of geographical patterns in the exome data and a comparison of complete mitochondrial genome sequences for each individual (constructed from the low-coverage data) that show population colonization patterns along the US east coast. With a total cost per sample of less than 50 USD (including sequencing) and ability to prepare 96 libraries in only 5 h, our approach adds a viable new option to the population genomics toolbox.",2017,"exome capture; library preparation; low-coverage sequencing; mitogenomics; nonmodel population genomics","Article","ISI"

This calls for management strategies that are focused on maximizing the evolutionary potential of coral reefs. Fundamental to this is an accurate understanding of the spatial genetic structure in dominant reef-building coral species. In this study, we apply a genotyping- by-sequencing approach to investigate genome-wide patterns of genetic diversity, gene flow, and local adaptation in a reef-building coral, Pocillopora damicornis, across 10 degrees of latitude and a transition from temperate to tropical waters. We identified strong patterns of differentiation and reduced genetic diversity in high-latitude populations. In addition, genome-wide scans for selection identified a number of outlier loci putatively under directional selection with homology to proteins previously known to be involved in heat tolerance in corals and associated with processes such as photoprotection, protein degradation, and immunity. This study provides genomic evidence for both restricted gene flow and local adaptation in a widely distributed coral species, and highlights the potential vulnerability of leading-edge populations to rapid environmental change as they are locally adapted, reproductively isolated, and have reduced levels of genetic diversity.",2017,"gene flow; genotyping-by-sequencing; local adaptation; pocillopora damicornis; western australia","Article","ISI"

Regions of high differentiation can arise due to divergent selection acting on selected loci, genetic hitchhiking of nearby loci, or through repeated selection against deleterious alleles (linked background selection); this divergence may then be further elevated in regions of reduced recombination. Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) from Europe and North America diverged >600,000 years ago and despite some evidence of secondary contact, the majority of genetic data indicate substantial divergence between lineages. This deep divergence with potential gene flow provides an opportunity to investigate the role of different mechanisms that shape the genomic landscape during early speciation. Here, using 184,295 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 80 populations, we investigate the genomic landscape of differentiation across the Atlantic Ocean with a focus on highly differentiated regions and the processes shaping them. We found evidence of high (meanF(ST) = 0.26) and heterogeneous genomic differentiation between continents. Genomic regions associated with high trans-Atlantic differentiation ranged in size from single loci (SNPs) within important genes to large regions (1-3 Mbp) on four chromosomes (Ssa06, Ssa13, Ssa16 and Ssa19). These regions showed signatures consistent with selection, including high linkage disequilibrium, despite no significant reduction in recombination. Genes and functional enrichment of processes associated with differentiated regions may highlight continental differences in ocean navigation and parasite resistance. Our results provide insight into potential mechanisms underlying differences between continents, and evidence of near-fixed and potentially adaptive trans-Atlantic differences concurrent with a background of high genome-wide differentiation supports subspecies designation in Atlantic salmon.",2020,"adaptation; conservation genetics; fish; genomics; population genetics","Article","ISI"

Here, we investigate how androdioecy (a breeding system characterized by partial selfing and outcrossing) and dioecy (characterized by obligatory outcrossing) influence the experimental evolution of inbreeding depression in Caenorhabditis elegans. We derived inbred lines from ancestral and evolved populations and found that the dioecious lineages underwent more extinction than androdioecious lineages. For both breeding systems, however, there was selection during inbreeding because the diversity patterns of 337 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among surviving inbred lines deviated from neutral expectations. In parallel, we also followed the evolution of embryo to adult viability, which revealed similar starting levels of inbreeding depression in both breeding systems, but also outbreeding depression. Under androdioecy, diversity at a neutral subset of 134 SNPs correlated well with the viability trajectories, showing that the population genetic structure imposed by partial selfing affected the opportunity for different forms of selection. Our findings suggest that the interplay between the disruptions of coevolved sets of loci by outcrossing, the efficient purging of deleterious recessive alleles with selfing and overdominant selection with outcrossing can help explain mixed breeding systems.",2014,"experimental evolution; c. elegans; selfing; population genomics; snps; identity disequilibria","Article","ISI"

Fresh leaves, which vary in traits such as defensive compounds against terrestrial herbivores, drop off trees and enter streams, providing a vital resource for riverine organisms. We demonstrate substantial variation in decomposition rates among individual trees in four different rivers in the Olympic Peninsula of Washington State, USA. We show that locally derived red alder leaf litter decomposes on average 24% faster than red alder leaf litter introduced from other riparian zones. Within rivers, leaves downstream of their parent trees decompose nearly as quickly as leaves from local trees. Leaves upstream of the parent tree decomposed as slowly as leaves from trees growing alongside different rivers. Over time, aquatic decomposer communities have locally adapted to the specific trees supplying the riparian subsidies. In energy-limited environments, such as small shaded streams, consumers must be efficient foragers. Our results indicate that this pressure for efficiency has led to adaptation at a particularly fine scale. More broadly, these results illustrate how genetic diversity and the effects of selection in one ecosystem can indirectly shape the structure of other ecosystems through ecological fluxes across boundaries.",2014,"ecosystem subsidies; indirect effects; intraspecific variation; local adaptation; trophic interactions","Article","ISI"

In Australia, projections indicate that the rate and magnitude of climate change will vary across the continent. We review the likely effects of these changes on Australian freshwater fishes across geographic regions encompassing a diversity of habitats and climatic variability. Commonalities in the predicted implications of climate change on fish included habitat loss and fragmentation, surpassing of physiological tolerances and spread of alien species. Existing anthropogenic stressors in more developed regions are likely to compound these impacts because of the already reduced resilience of fish assemblages. Many Australian freshwater fish species are adapted to variable or unpredictable flow conditions and, in some cases, this evolutionary history may confer resistance or resilience to the impacts of climate change. However, the rate and magnitude of projected change will outpace the adaptive capacities of many species. Climate change therefore seriously threatens the persistence of many of Australia's freshwater fish species, especially of those with limited ranges or specific habitat requirements, or of those that are already occurring close to physiological tolerance limits. Human responses to climate change should be proactive and focus on maintaining population resilience through the protection of habitat, mitigation of current anthropogenic stressors, adequate planning and provisioning of environmental flows and the consideration of more interventionist options such as managed translocations.",2011,"arid zone; drought; environmental flows; freshwater fish; life history; local adaptation; refugia; threatened species","Article","ISI"

OA is suspected to impact the calcification rate of corals as well as multiple early life stages including larval and settlement stages. Meanwhile, there is now a strong interest in evaluating if organisms have the potential for acclimatization or adaptation to OA. Here, by taking advantage of a naturally acidified site in Nikko Bay, Palau where corals are presumably exposed to high CO2 conditions for their entire life history, we tested if adult and the next-generation larvae of the brooder coral Pocillopora acuta originating from the high-CO2 site are more tolerant to high CO2 conditions compared to the individuals from a control site. Larvae released from adults collected from the high-CO2 site within the bay and a control site outside the bay were reciprocally cultivated under experimental control or high-CO2 seawater conditions to evaluate their physiology. Additionally, reciprocal transplantation of adult P. acuta corals were conducted between the high-CO2 and control sites in the field. The larvae originating from the control site showed lower Chlorophyll-a content and lipid percentages when reared under high-CO2 compared to control seawater conditions, while larvae originating from the high-CO2 site did not. Additionally, all 10 individuals of adult P. acuta from control site died when transplanted within the bay, while all P. acuta corals within the bay survived at both control and high-CO2 site. Furthermore, P. acuta within the bay showed higher calcification and net photosynthesis rates when exposed to the condition they originated from. These results are one of the first results that indicate the possibility that the long-living corals could enable to show local adaptation to different environmental conditions including high seawater pCO(2).",2020,"coral; high-co2; local adaptation; trans-generation acclimatization; naturally acidified site","Article","ISI"

The evolutionary outcomes of such secondary contacts may be diverse (e.g. adaptive introgression from or into the introduced species) but are not yet well examined in the wild. The recent secondary contact between the non-native sea squirt Ciona robusta (formerly known as C. intestinalis type A) and its native congener C. intestinalis (formerly known as C. intestinalis type B), in the Western English Channel, provides an excellent case study to examine. To examine contemporary hybridization between the two species, we developed a panel of 310 ancestry-informative SNPs from a population transcriptomic study. Hybridization rates were examined on 449 individuals sampled in eight sites from the sympatric range and five sites from allopatric ranges. The results clearly showed an almost complete absence of contemporary hybridization between the two species in syntopic localities, with only one-first-generation hybrid and no other genotype compatible with recent backcrosses. Despite the almost lack of contemporary hybridization, shared polymorphisms were observed in sympatric and allopatric populations of both species. Furthermore, one allopatric population from SE Pacific exhibited a higher rate of shared polymorphisms compared to all other C. robusta populations. Altogether, these results indicate that the observed level of shared polymorphism is more probably the outcome of ancient gene flow spread afterwards at a worldwide scale. They also emphasize efficient reproductive barriers preventing hybridization between introduced and native species, which suggests hybridization should not impede too much the expansion and the establishment of the non-native species in its introduction range.",2016,"biological invasions; contemporary hybridization; past introgression; population genomics; secondary contacts; tunicates","Article","ISI"

The roles of paleogeographic events and nature selection in speciation process often are under focus of research. We studied genetic diversity of anadromous and resident tapertail anchovies (Coilia nasus species complex) in the Yangtze River Basin using 4,434 nuclear loci, and tested the history of freshwater invasion of C. nasus. We found that both C. brachygnathus and C. nasus were valid species, but the resident C. nasus taihuensis and the anadromous C. nasus were not different genetically based on Bayes factor species delimitation (BFD*). Maximum likelihood tree, Network, PCA and STRUCTURE analyses all corroborated the results of BFD*. Two independent freshwater invasion events of C. nasus were supported, with the first event occurring around 4.07 Ma and the second happened around 3.2 Ka. The time of the two freshwater invasions is consistent with different paleogeographic events. Estimation showed that gene flow was higher within ecotypes than between different ecotypes. F-DIST analyses identified 120 disruptive outliers by comparing C. brachygnathus to anadromous C. nasus, and 21 disruptive outliers by comparing resident C. nasus to anadromous C. nasus. Nine outliers were found to be common between the two comparisons, indicating that independent freshwater invasion of C. nasus might involve similar molecular pathways.

To test this hypothesis, a set of 2,170 putative neutral single nucleotide polymorphisms discovered by a double digest restriction-site associated DNA approach was used on 10 locations along the BCP. The results revealed a population structure with three putative groups: Guadalupe Island and northern and southern BCP locations. The contemporary gene flow might be explained by local oceanographic features, where it is bidirectional within the southern region but with a predominant southward flow from the northern region.

Environmental features differ dramatically between the two spawning habitats, creating divergent selection pressures on early life history stages. We test for evidence of local adaptation or facultative spawning using a common garden experiment (CGE) design. Artificially fertilized eggs from two beach sites and one demersal site were incubated across a temperature gradient: 4 degrees C (cold; representative of demersal sites), 7 degrees C (medium) and 12 degrees C (warm; representative of beach sites). Reaction norms did not differ between beach and demersal sites, providing support that capelin are facultative spawners. Irrespective of the habitat adults were collected in, temperatures from 4 to 7 degrees C produced larvae with a higher probability of survival due to higher hatching success, length at hatch and nutritional reserves. The ability to behaviourally adjust spawning habitat based on prevailing temperature may be critical to maximize recruitment and minimize population-level impacts of climate change on this key forage fish.

In particular, lead exposure can act as a stressor to wildlife and cause negative effects on fitness. Any ability to adapt to stress caused by the negative effects of trace metal exposure would be beneficial for species living in contaminated environments. However, mechanisms for responding adaptively to metal contamination are not fully understood in free-living organisms. The Australian populations of the house sparrow (Passer domesticus) provides an excellent opportunity to study potential adaptation to environmental lead contamination because they have a commensal relationship with humans and are distributed broadly across Australian settlements including many long-term mining and smelting communities. To examine the potential for an evolutionary response to long-term lead exposure, we collected genomic SNP data using the house sparrow 200 K SNP array, from 11 localities across the Australian distribution including two mining sites (Broken Hill and Mount Isa, which are two genetically independent populations) that have well-established elevated levels of lead contamination as well as trace metals and metalloids. We contrast these known contaminated locations to other lesser-contaminated environments. Using an ecological association genome scan method to identify genomic differentiation associated with estimates of lead contamination we identified 60 outlier loci across three tests. A total of 39 genes were found to be physically linked (within 20 kbps) of all outliers in the house sparrow reference genome. The linked candidate genes included 12 genes relevant to lead exposure, such as two metal transporters that can transport metals including lead and zinc across cell membranes.

Understanding the proximate source(s) of invasion can inform biosecurity plans and eradication strategies for preventing or mitigating impacts to native biodiversity. The Haida Gwaii archipelago, located off the coast of British Columbia, Canada, is a significant nesting site for 1.5 million seabirds across 12 species, half of which are now threatened by brown rats. Local knowledge points to a European origin in the late 1800's to early 1900's, though the true source(s) and firm date(s) of invasion remain unknown. To fill these knowledge gaps, we analyzed genotypic data (16,598 SNPs) for 280 brown rats sampled throughout Haida Gwaii relative to a published global database of potential source populations. Principle component analysis and population assignment tests supported multiple potential invasion sources from Europe and North America. Likewise, demographic modelling best supported two invasions into the islands. The first invasion likely occurred in the early 1900's into the south-central archipelago from Western Europe followed by a more recent invasion in the early 2000's from Vancouver, British Columbia, into northern Haida Gwaii. The northern invasion of Haida Gwaii could also be indicative of contemporary gene flow between Haida Gwaii and the mainland, representing a significant biosecurity risk. Our results will inform management strategies for invasive rats in Haida Gwaii and serve as a guide for studies in other isolated systems worldwide.",2021,"invasive species; island ecosystem; phylogeography; population genomics; conservation","Article","ISI"

Using a large SNP data set from 259 RAD-sequenced European eel individuals (glass eels) from eight locations between 34 and 64(o)N, we examined the patterns of genome-wide genetic diversity across locations. We tested for local selection by searching for increased population differentiation using F-ST-based outlier tests and by testing for significant associations between allele frequencies and environmental variables. The overall low genetic differentiation found (F-ST=0.0007) indicates that most of the genome is homogenized by gene flow, providing further evidence for genomic panmixia in the European eel. The lack of genetic substructuring was consistent at both nuclear and mitochondrial SNPs. Using an extensive number of diagnostic SNPs, results showed a low occurrence of hybrids between European and American eel, mainly limited to Iceland (5.9%), although individuals with signatures of introgression several generations back in time were found in mainland Europe. Despite panmixia, a small set of SNPs showed high genetic differentiation consistent with single-generation signatures of spatially varying selection acting on glass eels. After screening 50354 SNPs, a total of 754 potentially locally selected SNPs were identified. Candidate genes for local selection constituted a wide array of functions, including calcium signalling, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and circadian rhythm. Remarkably, one of the candidate genes identified is PERIOD, possibly related to differences in local photoperiod associated with the >30 degrees difference in latitude between locations. Genes under selection were spread across the genome, and there were no large regions of increased differentiation as expected when selection occurs within just a single generation due to panmixia. This supports the conclusion that most of the genome is homogenized by gene flow that removes any effects of diversifying selection from each new generation.",2014,"panmixia; spatially varying selection; local adaptation; anguilla","Article","ISI"
"Plasticity, Not Adaptation to Salt Level, Explains Variation Along a Salinity Gradient in a Salt Marsh Perennial","10.1007/s12237-009-9186-4","Richards, CL; White, SN; McGuire, MA; Franks, SJ; Donovan, LA; Mauricio, R","Evolutionary ecologists have long been intrigued by the fact that many plant species can inhabit a broad range of environmental conditions and that plants often exhibit dramatic differences in phenotype across environmental gradients. We investigated responses to salinity treatments in the salt marsh plant Borrichia frutescens to determine if the species is responding to variation in edaphic salt content through phenotypic plasticity or specialized trait response. We grew seedlings from fruits collected in high- and low-salt microhabitats, assigned seedlings to high- and low-salt treatments in a greenhouse, and measured traits related to salt tolerance. All traits were highly plastic in response to salinity. Plants from the two microhabitats did not differ in trait means or respond differently to the treatments. These results suggest that environmental differences between the two microhabitats are not creating genotypes adapted to high and low salt levels. In addition, despite evidence for variation in allozyme markers in this population, there was no significant genotypic variation (family effect) in any of the trait means measured across microhabitats. There was variation in plasticity for only leaf Na and leaf B concentration. The high degree of plasticity for all traits and the lack of differences among microhabitats across the salinity gradient suggest plasticity in many traits may be fixed for this species.",2010,"boron; sodium; adaptive plasticity; local adaptation; optimal reaction norm; phenotypic plasticity; salt-tolerance traits; specialization","Article","ISI"

Many exon markers have been developed in plants, sharks, frogs, reptiles, fishes, and others, but no universal exon markers have been tested in ray-finned fishes. Here, we identified a suite of single-copy protein-coding sequence (CDS) markers through comparing eight fish genomes, and tested them empirically in 83 species (33 families and nine orders or higher clades: Acipenseriformes, Lepisosteiformes, Elopomorpha, Osteoglossomorpha, Clupeiformes, Cypriniformes, Gobiaria, Carangaria, and Eupercaria; sensu Betancur et al. 2013). Sorting the markers according to their completeness and phylogenetic decisiveness in taxa tested resulted in a selection of 4,434 markers, which were proven to be useful in reconstructing phylogenies of the ray-finned fishes at different taxonomic levels.

"Flickers of speciation: Sympatric colour morphs of the arc-eye hawkfish, Paracirrhites arcatus, reveal key elements of divergence with gene flow","10.1111/mec.14527","Whitney, JL; Bowen, BW; Karl, SA","One of the primary challenges of evolutionary research is to identify ecological factors that favour reproductive isolation. Therefore, studying partially isolated taxa has the potential to provide novel insight into the mechanisms of evolutionary divergence. Our study utilizes an adaptive colour polymorphism in the arc-eye hawkfish (Paracirrhites arcatus) to explore the evolution of reproductive barriers in the absence of geographic isolation. Dark and light morphs are ecologically partitioned into basaltic and coral microhabitats a few metres apart. To test whether ecological barriers have reduced gene flow among dark and light phenotypes, we evaluated genetic variation at 30 microsatellite loci and a nuclear exon (Mc1r) associated with melanistic coloration. We report low, but significant microsatellite differentiation among colour morphs and stronger divergence in the coding region of Mc1r indicating signatures of selection. Critically, we observed greater genetic divergence between colour morphs on the same reefs than that between the same morphs in different geographic locations. We hypothesize that adaptation to the contrasting microhabitats is overriding gene flow and is responsible for the partial reproductive isolation observed between sympatric colour morphs. Combined with complementary studies of hawkfish ecology and behaviour, these genetic results indicate an ecological barrier to gene flow initiated by habitat selection and enhanced by assortative mating. Hence, the arc-eye hawkfish fulfil theoretical expectations for the earliest phase of speciation with gene flow.",2018,"colour polymorphism; coral reef fish; divergence with gene flow; incipient speciation; local adaptation; reproductive isolation","Article","ISI"

Here we show the results of a spatial vulnerability assessment for SEQ's coastal region and use them as the basis to assess progress in adaptation in five coastal Local Government areas. An integrated framework based on external (exposure) and internal (sensitivity and adaptive capacity) dimensions is used to produce one single index to provide a measure of SEQ's vulnerability to coastal hazards. Coastal Local Governments' progress in adaptation is evaluated based on a semi-quantitative assessment of pre-determined Adaptation Functions adapted to the SEQ context. The assessment reveals information specifically relevant for adaptation investment at the local government level. It is concluded that the five coastal Local Governments analysed have considerable capacity to deal with coastal hazards. However, there are numerous coastal suburbs that are highly vulnerable and this is mainly, due to the fact that the majority of the SEQ coastal region is intrinsically highly exposed and sensitive to climatic drivers. We argue that this vulnerability can be reduced if Local Governments continue to further their progress in adaptation through coastal planning and management frameworks. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

"Ancestral genetic variation in phenotypic plasticity underlies rapid evolutionary changes in resurrected populations of waterfleas","10.1073/pnas.2006581117","Landy, JA; Oschmann, A; Munch, SB; Walsh, MR","The role of phenotypic plasticity in adaptive evolution has been debated for decades. This is because the strength of natural selection is dependent on the direction and magnitude of phenotypic responses to environmental signals. Therefore, the connection between plasticity and adaptation will depend on the patterns of plasticity harbored by ancestral populations before a change in the environment. Yet few studies have directly assessed ancestral variation in plasticity and tracked phenotypic changes over time. Here we resurrected historic propagules of Daphnia spanning multiple species and lakes in Wisconsin following the invasion and proliferation of a novel predator (spiny waterflea, Bythotrephes longimanus). This approach revealed extensive genetic variation in predator-induced plasticity in ancestral populations of Daphnia. It is unlikely that the standing patterns of plasticity shielded Daphnia from selection to permit long-term coexistence with a novel predator. Instead, this variation in plasticity provided the raw materials for Bythotrephes-mediated selection to drive rapid shifts in Daphnia behavior and life history. Surprisingly, there was little evidence for the evolution of trait plasticity as genetic variation in plasticity was maintained in the face of a novel predator. Such results provide insight into the link between plasticity and adaptation and highlight the importance of quantifying genetic variation in plasticity when evaluating the drivers of evolutionary change in the wild.",2020,"local adaptation; life history evolution; behavior; species invasion; bythotrephes","Article","ISI"
"Within-generation consequences of postsettlement mortality for trait composition in wild populations: An experimental test","10.1002/ece3.4911","Ciotti, BJ; Planes, S","There is a critical need to understand patterns and causes of intraspecific variation in physiological performance in order to predict the distribution and dynamics of wild populations under natural and human-induced environmental change. However, the usual explanation for trait differences, local adaptation, fails to account for the small-scale phenotypic and genetic divergence observed in fishes and other species with dispersive early life stages. We tested the hypothesis that local-scale variation in the strength of selective mortality in early life mediates the trait composition in later life stages. Through in situ experiments, we manipulated exposure to predators in the coral reef damselfish Dascyllus aruanus and examined consequences for subsequent growth performance under common garden conditions. Groups of 20 recently settled D. aruanus were outplanted to experimental coral colonies in Moorea lagoon and either exposed to natural predation mortality (52% mortality in three days) or protected from predators with cages for three days. After postsettlement mortality, predator-exposed groups were shorter than predator-protected ones, while groups with lower survival were in better condition, suggesting that predators removed the longer, thinner individuals. Growth of both treatment groups was subsequently compared under common conditions. We did not detect consequences of predator exposure for subsequent growth performance: Growth over the following 37 days was not affected by the prior predator treatment or survival. Genotyping at 10 microsatellite loci did indicate, however, that predator exposure significantly influenced the genetic composition of groups. We conclude that postsettlement mortality did not have carryover effects on the subsequent growth performance of cohorts in this instance, despite evidence for directional selection during the initial mortality phase.",2019,"delayed life-history effects; genetic sweepstakes; local adaptation; plasticity; recruitment; selection; trait-mediated effects","Article","ISI"

Coexisting salmonid fish populations are known from over 100 freshwater lakes. Most studies of sympatric populations have used limited numbers of genetic markers making it unclear if genetic divergence involves certain parts of the genome. We returned to the first reported case of salmonid sympatry, initially detected through contrasting homozygosity at a single allozyme locus (coding for lactate dehydrogenase A) in brown trout in the small Lakes Bunnersjoarna, Sweden. First, we verified the existence of the two coexisting demes using a 96-SNP fluidigm array. We then applied whole-genome resequencing of pooled DNA to explore genome-wide diversity within and between these demes; nucleotide diversity was higher in deme I than in deme II. Strong genetic divergence is observed with genome-wide F-ST approximate to 0.2. Compared with data from populations of similar small lakes, this divergence is of similar magnitude as that between reproductively isolated populations. Individual whole-genome resequencing of two individuals per deme suggests higher inbreeding in deme II versus deme I, indicating different degree of isolation. We located two gene-copies for LDH-A and found divergence between demes in a regulatory section of one of these genes. However, we did not find a perfect fit between the sequence data and previous allozyme results, and this will require further research. Our data demonstrates genome-wide divergence governed mostly by genetic drift but also by diversifying selection in coexisting populations.

Plants from different populations often display a variation in herbivore resistance. However, it is rarely understood what plant traits mediate such differences. 2. It was tested how leaf phenology affects herbivore populations in a 15-year-old common garden of valley oaks (Quercus lobata Nee) with different populations and maternal parents from throughout the Q. lobata range. 3. The abundance of leaf miners (Stigmella sp. Shrank) and leaf phenology of oaks in the common garden was measured. 4. Leaf miner abundance varied among provenance locations (population), but not among maternal parents within populations. Leaf phenology varied by provenance location and maternal parent, and trees that leafed out earlier accrued higher leaf-miner abundance. Path analysis indicated that leaf phenology was the likely driver of provenance and parental differences in resistance to leaf miners. 5. Understanding population differences is particularly important when considering transport of genotypes for ornamental or restoration purposes. The present study suggests that similarity in leaf phenology may be one factor that could be used to find genotypes with a similar herbivore resistance to local genotypes.",2015,"folivory; leaf mine; local adaptation; provenance; quercus","Article","ISI"
"Cost-effective genome-wide estimation of allele frequencies from pooled DNA in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.)","10.1186/1471-2164-14-12","Ozerov, M; Vasemagi, A; Wennevik, V; Niemela, E; Prusov, S; Kent, M; Vaha, JP","Background: New sequencing technologies have tremendously increased the number of known molecular markers (single nucleotide polymorphisms; SNPs) in a variety of species. Concurrently, improvements to genotyping technology have now made it possible to efficiently genotype large numbers of genome-wide distributed SNPs enabling genome wide association studies (GWAS). However, genotyping significant numbers of individuals with large number of SNPs remains prohibitively expensive for many research groups. A possible solution to this problem is to determine allele frequencies from pooled DNA samples, such 'allelotyping' has been presented as a cost-effective alternative to individual genotyping and has become popular in human GWAS. In this article we have tested the effectiveness of DNA pooling to obtain accurate allele frequency estimates for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) populations using an Illumina SNP-chip. Results: In total, 56 Atlantic salmon DNA pools from 14 populations were analyzed on an Atlantic salmon SNP-chip containing probes for 5568 SNP markers, 3928 of which were bi-allelic. We developed an efficient quality control filter which enables exclusion of loci showing high error rate and minor allele frequency (MAF) close to zero. After applying multiple quality control filters we obtained allele frequency estimates for 3631 bi-allelic loci. We observed high concordance (r > 0.99) between allele frequency estimates derived from individual genotyping and DNA pools. Our results also indicate that even relatively small DNA pools (35 individuals) can provide accurate allele frequency estimates for a given sample. Conclusions: Despite of higher level of variation associated with array replicates compared to pool construction, we suggest that both sources of variation should be taken into account. This study demonstrates that DNA pooling allows fast and high-throughput determination of allele frequencies in Atlantic salmon enabling cost-efficient identification of informative markers for discrimination of populations at various geographical scales, as well as identification of loci controlling ecologically and economically important traits.",2013,"dna pooling; atlantic salmon; snp; allele frequency estimation; allelotyping; population genomics","Article","ISI"
"Incomplete bioinformatic filtering and inadequate age and growth analysis lead to an incorrect inference of harvested-induced changes","10.1111/eva.13122","Larson, WA; Isermann, DA; Feiner, ZS","Understanding the evolutionary impacts of harvest on fish populations is important for informing fisheries management and conservation and has become a growing research topic over the last decade. However, the dynamics of fish populations are highly complex, and phenotypes can be influenced by many biotic and abiotic factors. Therefore, it is vital to collect robust data and explore multiple alternative hypotheses before concluding that fish populations are influenced by harvest. In their recently published manuscript, Bowles et al, Evolutionary Applications, 13(6):1128 conducted age/growth and genomic analysis of walleye (Sander vitreus) populations sampled 13-15 years (1-2.5 generations) apart and hypothesized that observed phenotypic and genomic changes in this time period were likely due to harvest. Specifically, Bowles et al. (2020) documented differential declines in size-at-age in three exploited walleye populations compared to a separate, but presumably less-exploited, reference population. Additionally, they documented population genetic differentiation in one population pair, homogenization in another, and outlier loci putatively under selection across time points. Based on their phenotypic and genetic results, they hypothesized that selective harvest had led to fisheries-induced evolution (referred to as nascent changes) in the exploited populations in as little as 1-2.5 generations. We re-analyzed their data and found that (a) sizes declined across both exploited and reference populations during the time period studied and (b) observed genomic differentiation in their study was the result of inadequate data filtering, including retaining individuals with high amounts of missing data and retaining potentially undersplit and oversplit loci that created false signals of differentiation between time points. This re-analysis did not provide evidence for phenotypic or genetic changes attributable to harvest in any of the study populations, contrasting the hypotheses presented by Bowles et al. (2020).

"Genomic signatures of evolution in Nautilus-An endangered living fossil","10.1111/mec.14344","Combosch, DJ; Lemer, S; Ward, PD; Landman, NH; Giribet, G","Living fossils are survivors of previously more diverse lineages that originated millions of years ago and persisted with little morphological change. Therefore, living fossils are model organisms to study both long-term and ongoing adaptation and speciation processes. However, many aspects of living fossil evolution and their persistence in the modern world remain unclear. Here, we investigate three major aspects of the evolutionary history of living fossils: cryptic speciation, population genetics and effective population sizes, using members of the genera Nautilus and Allonautilus as classic examples of true living fossils. For this, we analysed genome-wide ddRAD-Seq data for all six currently recognized nautiloid species throughout their distribution range. Our analyses identified three major allopatric Nautilus clades: a South Pacific clade, subdivided into three subclades with no signs of admixture between them; a Coral Sea clade, consisting of two genetically distinct populations with significant admixture; and a widespread Indo-Pacific clade, devoid of significant genetic substructure. Within these major clades, we detected five Nautilus groups, which likely correspond to five distinct species. With the exception of Nautilus macromphalus, all previously described species are at odds with genome-wide data, testifying to the prevalence of cryptic species among living fossils. Detailed FST analyses further revealed significant genome-wide and locus-specific signatures of selection between species and differentiated populations, which is demonstrated here for the first time in a living fossil. Finally, approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) simulations suggest large effective population sizes, which may explain the low levels of population differentiation commonly observed in living fossils.",2017,"ddrad-seq; evolutionary genomics; mollusca; nautilus; phylogenetics; population genetics","Article","ISI"

A combination of anthropogenic and natural factors threaten submerged macrophyte beds in the two South African estuaries (Bushmans and Kariega) in which the species' only two known remaining populations reside. Here, we genotyped 34 pipefish from both populations using genome-wide data to determine whether the two estuaries harbour distinct genetic diversity, such that translocating individuals between them might improve the genetic health of both. Our results show that both populations are highly inbred, and no statistically significant genetic structure was found between them. Moreover, individuals both within and between estuaries were very closely related to each other.

Even though recent surveys have estimated population sizes in the order of thousands of individuals, these may fluctuate considerably.

Previous work has shown that Mpi allozyme genotypes (fast and slow) have different fre-quencies across Atlantic intertidal zones due to selection on post-settlement survival (i.e., allele zonation). We present the complete gene sequence of the Mpi locus and quantify nucleotide polymor-phism in S. balanoides, as well as divergence to its sister taxon Semibalanus cariosus. We show that the slow allozyme contains a derived charge-altering amino acid polymorphism, and both allo-zyme classes correspond to two haplogroups with multiple internal haplotypes. The locus shows several footprints of balancing selec-tion around the fast/slow site: an enrichment of positive Tajima's D for nonsynonymous mutations, an excess of polymorphism, and a spike in the levels of silent polymorphism relative to silent diver-gence, as well as a site frequency spectrum enriched for midfre-quency mutations. We observe other departures from neutrality across the locus in both coding and noncoding regions. These in-clude a nonsynonymous trans-species polymorphism and a recent mutation under selection within the fast haplogroup. The latter suggests ongoing allelic replacement of functionally relevant amino acid variants. Moreover, predicted models of Mpi protein structure provide insight into the functional significance of the putatively selected amino acid polymorphisms. While footprints of selection are widespread across the range of S. balanoides, our data show that intertidal zonation patterns are variable across both spatial and temporal scales.

"Local adaptation stops where ecological gradients steepen or are interrupted","10.1111/eva.12789","Bridle, JR; Kawata, M; Butlin, RK","Population genetic models of evolution along linear environmental gradients cannot explain why adaptation stops at ecological margins. This is because, unless models impose reductions in carrying capacity at species' edges, the dominant effect of gene flow is to increase genetic variance and adaptive potential rather than swamping local adaptation. This allows the population to match even very steep changes in trait optima. We extend our previous simulations to explore two nonlinear models of ecological gradients: (a) a sigmoid (steepening) gradient and (b) a linear gradient with a flat centre of variable width. We compare the parameter conditions that allow local adaptation and range expansion from the centre, with those that permit the persistence of a perfectly adapted population distributed across the entire range. Along nonlinear gradients, colonization is easier, and extinction rarer, than along a linear gradient. This is because the shallow environmental gradient near the range centre does not cause gene flow to increase genetic variation, and so does not result in reduced population density. However, as gradient steepness increases, gene flow inflates genetic variance and reduces local population density sufficiently that genetic drift overcomes local selection, creating a finite range margin. When a flat centre is superimposed on a linear gradient, gene flow increases genetic variation dramatically at its edges, leading to an abrupt reduction in density that prevents niche expansion. Remarkably local interruptions in a linear ecological gradient (of a width much less than the mean dispersal distance) can prevent local adaptation beyond this flat centre. In contrast to other situations, this effect is stronger and more consistent where carrying capacity is high. Practically speaking, this means that habitat improvement at patch margins will make evolutionary rescue more likely. By contrast, even small improvements in habitat at patch centres may confine populations to limited areas of ecological space.",2019,"ecological margins; local adaptation; niche expansion; patchiness; population genetics","Article","ISI"

The use of relatively few genetic markers, however, may have limited power to detect subtle but significant structure that could inform fisheries management. In this study, the potential for genome-scale datasets to uncover subtle patterns of population structure in the blue crab was examined using a high-throughput genotyping approach (genotyping-by-sequencing) that generated data for more than 9,600 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in crabs from three populations: Panama City Beach, FL, Agawam River, MA, and Porto Alegre, Brazil. Principle components analyses among the three populations revealed very distinct clustering of the Brazilian samples from U.S. populations, likely reflecting restricted gene flow across the equator. Detailed analysis of population structure between the two U. S. populations revealed low but significant genetic differentiation (F-ST = 0.0103), with F-ST values ranging from -0.05 to 0.48. Previous studies have failed to detect significant genetic structure on a similar geographic scale. F-ST outlier analysis identified 242 loci (2.45% of total) with statistically extreme values at the false discovery rate alpha = 0.05 level, only 16 of which showed significant sequence homology to annotated proteins via BLASTx alignment. Top BLASTx hits were to crustacean or arthropod sequences and 8 of the 16 had high sequence similarity to transposable elements or related machinery. Finally, results of population assignment tests for the two U. S. populations showed that the full marker dataset provided good power to assign individuals back to their population of origin (similar to 83% and 92% success for Panama City Beach and Agawam River, respectively), which dropped significantly when using only 500 randomly selected SNPs (similar to 61% and 72% success). Overall, this study demonstrates the great utility of high-throughput sequencing technologies for characterizing fine-scale patterns of genetic structure in blue crabs, and this approach should substantially improve the delineation of stock structure and further advance our understanding of blue crab population connectivity and ecology.",2017,"f-st; population structure; blue crabs; connectivity; dispersal; genomics; callinectes sapidus","Article","ISI"
"Adaptation to a latitudinal thermal gradient within a widespread copepod species: the contributions of genetic divergence and phenotypic plasticity","10.1098/rspb.2017.0236","Pereira, RJ; Sasaki, MC; Burton, RS","Understanding how populations adapt to heterogeneous thermal regimes is essential for comprehending how latitudinal gradients in species diversification are formed, and how taxa will respond to ongoing climate change. Adaptation can occur by innate genetic factors, by phenotypic plasticity, or by a combination of both mechanisms. Yet, the relative contribution of such mechanisms to large-scale latitudinal gradients of thermal tolerance across conspecific populations remains unclear. We examine thermal performance in 11 populations of the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus, ranging from Baja California Sur (Mexico) to British Columbia (Canada). Common garden experiments show that survivorship to acute heat-stress differs between populations (by up to 3.8 degrees C in LD50 values), reflecting a strong genetic thermal adaptation. Using a split-brood experiment with two rearing temperatures, we also show that developmental phenotypic plasticity is beneficial to thermal tolerance (by up to 1.3 degrees C), and that this effect differs across populations. Although genetic divergence in heat tolerance strongly correlates with latitude and temperature, differences in the plastic response do not. In the context of climate warming, our results confirm the general prediction that low-latitude populations are most susceptible to local extinction because genetic adaptation has placed physiological limits closer to current environmental maxima, but our results also contradict the prediction that phenotypic plasticity is constrained at lower latitudes.",2017,"local adaptation; developmental plasticity; heat-stress; acclimation; reaction norm; global warming","Article","ISI"
"Limited effects of source population identity and number on seagrass transplant performance","10.7717/peerj.2972","Novak, AB; Plaisted, HK; Hays, CG; Hughes, RA","Global declines in coastal foundation species highlight the importance of effective restoration. In this study, we examined the effects of source population identity and diversity (one vs. three sources per plot) on seagrass (Zostera marina) transplant success. The field experiment was replicated at two locations in Massachusetts with adjacent natural Zostera marina beds to test for local adaptation and source diversity effects on shoot density. We also collected morphological and genetic data to characterize variation within and among source populations, and evaluate whether they were related to performance. Transplants grew and expanded until six months post -transplantation, but then steadily, declined at both sites. Prior to declines, we observed variation in performance among source populations at one site that was related to morphological traits: the populations with the longest leaves had the highest shoot densities, whereas the population with the shortest leaves performed the worst at six months post -transplantation. In addition, multiple source plots at this same transplant site consistently had similar or higher shoot densities than single source plots, and shoots from weak -performing populations showed improved performance in multiple source plots. We found no evidence for home site advantage or benefits of population -level genetic variation in early transplant performance at either site. Our results show limited effects of source population on early transplant performance and suggest that factors (e.g., morphology) other than home site advantage and population genetic variation serve a role. Based on our overall findings that transplant success varied among source populations and that population diversity at the plot level had positive but limited effects on individual and plot performance, we support planting shoots from multiple source sites in combination to enhance transplant success, particularly in the absence of detailed information on individual source characteristics.",2017,"biodiversity; eelgrass; local adaptation; genetic diversity; restoration; foundation species","Article","ISI"

Its study often relies on microparasitic infections introducing a potential bias in the estimation of the evolutionary change of host and parasite traits. Using biological invasions as a tool to study host-parasite coevolution in nature can overcome these biases. We demonstrate this with a cross-infection experiment in the invasive macroparasite Mytilicola intestinalis and its bivalve host, the blue mussel Mytilus edulis. The invasion history of the parasite is well known for the southeastern North Sea and is characterised by two separate invasion fronts that reached opposite ends of the Wadden Sea (i.e. Texel, The Netherlands and Sylt, Germany) in a similar time frame. The species' natural history thus makes this invasion an ideal natural experiment to study host-parasite coevolution in nature. We infected hosts from Texel, Sylt and Kiel (Baltic Sea, where the parasite is absent) with parasites from Texel and Sylt, to form sympatric, allopatric and naive infestation combinations, respectively. We measured infection rate, host condition and parasite growth to show that sympatric host-parasite combinations diverged in terms of pre- and post-infection traits within <100 generations since their introduction. Texel parasites were more infective and more efficient at exploiting the host's resources. Hosts on Texel, on the other hand, evolved resistance to infection, whereas hosts on Sylt may have evolved tolerance. This illustrates that different coevolutionary trajectories can evolve along separate invasion fronts of the parasite, highlighting the use of biological invasions in studies of host-parasite coevolution in nature.

For species that form climatic ecotypes, if future climate exceeds local population tolerance, climate change will precipitate the decline of extant populations range-wide. Here, we examine the variation in physiological and morphological traits of Eriophorum vaginatum L. collected from a 30-year-old reciprocal transplant experiment, in which six populations of E. vaginatum were transplanted along a latitudinal gradient from Eagle Creek to Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. We tested for ecotypic differentiation of photosynthesis, respiration, chlorophyll fluorescence, and biomass per tiller, which is a metric correlated with population growth in E. vaginatum. The light-saturated photosynthetic rate (A(max)) showed homesite advantage in that tussocks in their homesites had significantly higher values of A(max) relative to nonlocal populations. This pattern of homesite advantage was also observed for biomass per tiller, but not for fluorescence and respiration. Photosynthetic rate was positively correlated with biomass per tiller and survival, suggesting that adaptations related to photosynthesis may optimize performance of local populations to homesite conditions. Taken together, these findings indicate that a rapidly changing climate may elicit population decline of E. vaginatum, rendering this species at a competitive disadvantage to shrubs and boreal forest species, which are expanding northward as the climate changes. Transition from tussock-sedge tundra to boreal forest and shrubland alters features, such as albedo, soil temperature, and water-table depth, in ways that may accelerate climate change.",2014,"climate change; fluorescence; local adaptation; photosynthesis; respiration; tussock tundra","Article","ISI"

Indeed, inversions have been implicated in adaptation along environmental clines and in ecotype specialization. Here, we combine classical ecological studies and population genetics to investigate an inversion polymorphism previously documented in Europe among natural populations of the seaweed fly Coelopa frigida along a latitudinal cline in North America. We test if the inversion is present in North America and polymorphic, assess which environmental conditions modulate the inversion karyotype frequencies, and document the relationship between inversion karyotype and adult size. We sampled nearly 2000 flies from 20 populations along several environmental gradients to quantify associations of inversion frequencies to heterogeneous environmental variables. Genotyping and phenotyping showed a widespread and conserved inversion polymorphism between Europe and America. Variation in inversion frequency was significantly associated with environmental factors, with parallel patterns between continents, indicating that the inversion may play a role in local adaptation. The three karyotypes of the inversion are differently favoured across micro-habitats and represent life-history strategies likely to be maintained by the collective action of several mechanisms of balancing selection. Our study adds to the mounting evidence that inversions are facilitators of adaptation and enhance within-species diversity.",2018,"chromosomal inversions; environmental gradient; local adaptation; balancing selection; parrallelism; diptera","Article","ISI"

Inshore reefs in the Florida Keys experience higher temperatures than offshore reefs for prolonged periods during the summer. We conducted a common garden experiment with heat stress as our selective agent to test for local thermal adaptation in corals from inshore and offshore reefs. We show that inshore corals are more tolerant of a 6-week temperature stress than offshore corals. Compared with inshore corals, offshore corals in the 31 degrees C treatment showed significantly elevated bleaching levels concomitant with a tendency towards reduced growth. In addition, dinoflagellate symbionts (Symbiodinium sp.) of offshore corals exhibited reduced photosynthetic efficiency. We did not detect differences in the frequencies of major (>5%) haplotypes comprising Symbiodinium communities hosted by inshore and offshore corals, nor did we observe frequency shifts ('shuffling') in response to thermal stress. Instead, coral host populations showed significant genetic divergence between inshore and offshore reefs, suggesting that in Porites astreoides, the coral host might play a prominent role in holobiont thermotolerance.

These resources have the potential to significantly advance our understanding of diverse phenomena at the level of species, populations and individuals, ranging from patterns of synteny through rates of linkage disequilibrium (LD) decay and population structure to individual inbreeding. Consequently, we used PacBio sequencing to refine an existing Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) genome assembly and genotyped 83 individuals from six populations using restriction site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing. The resulting hybrid genome comprised 6,169 scaffolds with an N50 of 6.21 Mb and provided clear evidence for the conservation of large chromosomal segments between the fur seal and dog (Canis lupus familiaris). Focusing on the most extensively sampled population of South Georgia, we found that LD decayed rapidly, reaching the background level by around 400 kb, consistent with other vertebrates but at odds with the notion that fur seals experienced a strong historical bottleneck. We also found evidence for population structuring, with four main Antarctic island groups being resolved. Finally, appreciable variance in individual inbreeding could be detected, reflecting the strong polygyny and site fidelity of the species. Overall, our study contributes important resources for future genomic studies of fur seals and other pinnipeds while also providing a clear example of how high throughput sequencing can generate diverse biological insights at multiple levels of organization.",2018,"pacbio sequencing; rad sequencing; comparative genomics; single nucleotide polymorphism (snp); linkage disequilibrium (ld); population structure; genomic inbreeding coefficient","Article","ISI"

Heterogeneous genomic divergence among populations may reflect environmental selection. Advancing our understanding of the mechanisms by which organisms adapt to different temperatures in response to climate change and predicting the adaptive potential and ecological consequences of anthropogenic global warming are critical. We sequenced the whole genomes of Japanese whiting (Sillago japonica) specimens collected from different latitudinal locations along the coastal waters of China and Japan to detect possible thermal adaptations. Using population genomics, a total of 5.48 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from five populations revealed a complete genetic break between the Chinese and Japanese groups, which was attributed to both geographic distance and local adaptation. The shared natural selection genes between two isolated populations (i.e., Zhoushan and Ise Bay/Tokyo Bay) indicated possible parallel evolution at the genetic level induced by temperature. These genes also indicated that the process of temperature selection on isolated populations is repeatable. Moreover, we observed natural candidate genes related to membrane fluidity, possibly underlying adaptation to cold environmental stress. These findings advance our understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying the rapid adaptations of fish species. Species distribution projection models suggested that the Chinese and Japanese groups may have different responses to future climate change, with the former expanding and the latter contracting.

Here we set a protocol for small DNA samples combining whole genome amplification (WGA) and genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS). This protocol was applied to the worldwide invasive colonial ascidian Didemnum vexillum using a single zooid per colony. WGA-GBS performance was tested using half zooids, providing empirical demonstration for genotyping reliability. We analysed 296 individuals from 12 localities worldwide including native and the main invaded areas. Polymorphic loci datasets generated by locality, area and globally, identified genetic differentiation at all levels. The two groups found in Japan, the native area, matched Cytochrome Oxidase I clades and were strongly differentiated at the genomic level suggesting reproductive isolation. Our genomic analyses confirmed that only one clade spread worldwide. We also detected some clones, always within the same locality. Genetic diversity was high in both the introduced and in the native area. Three independent colonisation events determined the global distribution of the species, although population pairwise comparisons within each introduced genetic cluster were significant. Human-mediated transportation seems to drive the distribution pattern of this species worldwide and regionally, as there is a lack of isolation by distance within introduced areas.

This explosion of data provides a powerful new window into the molecular mechanisms of adaptation, and although there has been some success in using genomic data to predict responses to selection in fields such as agriculture, thus far genomic data are rarely integrated into predictive frameworks of future adaptation in natural populations. Here, we review both theoretical and empirical studies of adaptation to rapid environmental change, focusing on areas where genomic data are poised to contribute to our ability to estimate species and population persistence and adaptation.

New and cryptic species have been discovered, revealing surprisingly high species diversity under similar shell morphology. Genetic analyses have identified several species complexes where low genetic divergence indicates recent or ongoing speciation during the past 3-4 million years. Ongoing speciation is also supported by exceptionally high population divergence within some species. The oyster genome is highly polymorphic and gene-rich, with extensive expansion of genes related to stress and immune responses. High levels of genetic diversity and gene expansion in oysters are likely adaptations to variable environments. Local adaptation in oysters may be pervasive but countered by strong gene flow and balancing or multidirectional selections that favor diversity.

"Influence of density and salinity on larval development of salt-adapted and salt-naive frog populations","10.1002/ece3.6069","Albecker, MA; Pahl, M; Smith, M; Wilson, JG; McCoy, MW","Environmental change and habitat fragmentation will affect population densities for many species. For those species that have locally adapted to persist in changed or stressful habitats, it is uncertain how density dependence will affect adaptive responses. Anurans (frogs and toads) are typically freshwater organisms, but some coastal populations of green treefrogs (Hyla cinerea) have adapted to brackish, coastal wetlands. Tadpoles from coastal populations metamorphose sooner and demonstrate faster growth rates than inland populations when reared solitarily. Although saltwater exposure has adaptively reduced the duration of the larval period for coastal populations, increases in densities during larval development typically increase time to metamorphosis and reduce rates of growth and survival. We test how combined stressors of density and salinity affect larval development between salt-adapted (coastal) and nonsalt-adapted (inland) populations by measuring various developmental and metamorphic phenotypes. We found that increased tadpole density strongly affected coastal and inland tadpole populations similarly. In high-density treatments, both coastal and inland populations had reduced growth rates, greater exponential decay of growth, a smaller size at metamorphosis, took longer to reach metamorphosis, and had lower survivorship at metamorphosis. Salinity only exaggerated the effects of density on the time to reach metamorphosis and exponential decay of growth. Location of origin affected length at metamorphosis, with coastal tadpoles metamorphosing slightly longer than inland tadpoles across densities and salinities. These findings confirm that density has a strong and central influence on larval development even across divergent populations and habitat types and may mitigate the expression (and therefore detection) of locally adapted phenotypes.",2020,"anuran amphibian; complex life cycles; density dependence; local adaptation; salt tolerance","Article","ISI"

The drivers selecting for local adaptation and the contribution of adaptation to genetic differentiation are often unknown. Restoration and succession studies have revealed different colonization patterns for Brachypodium retusum, a common Mediterranean grass. In order to understand these patterns, we tested population differentiation and adaptation to different environmental factors. METHODS: Structured sampling of 12 populations from six sites and two soil types within site was used to analyze the spatial and environmental structure of population differentiation. Sampling sites differ in grazing intensity and climate. We tested germination and growth in a common garden. In subsets, we analyzed the differential response to stone cover, grazing and soil moisture. KEY RESULTS: We found significant differences among populations. The site explained population differentiation better than soil, suggesting a dominant influence of climate and/or genetic drift. Stone cover had a positive influence on seedling establishment, and populations showed a differential response. However, this response was not related to environmental differences between collection sites. Regrowth after clipping was higher in populations from the more intensively grazed Red Mediterranean soils suggesting an adaptation to grazing. Final germination was generally high even under drought, but germination response to differences in soil moisture was similar across populations. CONCLUSIONS: Adaptive population differentiation in germination and early growth may have contributed to different colonization patterns. Thus, the provenance of B. retusum needs to be carefully considered in ecological restoration.",2018,"common garden; local adaptation; plant origin; poaceae; population differentiation; seedling recruitment","Article","ISI"

"Oxygen uptake in Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp.: when ecology and physiology meet","10.1111/jfb.12790","Eliason, EJ; Farrell, AP","Over the past several decades, a substantial amount of research has examined how cardiorespiratory physiology supports the diverse activities performed throughout the life cycle of Pacific salmon, genus Oncorhynchus. Pioneering experiments emphasized the importance of aerobic scope in setting the functional thermal tolerance for activity in fishes. Variation in routine metabolism can have important performance and fitness consequences as it is related to dominance, aggression, boldness, territoriality, growth rate, postprandial oxygen consumption, life history, season, time of day, availability of shelter and social interactions. Wild fishes must perform many activities simultaneously (e.g. swim, obtain prey, avoid predators, compete, digest and reproduce) and oxygen delivery is allocated among competing organ systems according to the capacity of the heart to deliver blood. For example, salmonids that are simultaneously swimming and digesting trade-off maximum swimming performance in order to support the oxygen demands of digestion. As adult Pacific salmonids cease feeding in the ocean prior to their home migration, endogenous energy reserves and cardiac capacity are primarily partitioned among the demands for swimming upriver, sexual maturation and spawning behaviours. Furthermore, the upriver spawning migration is under strong selection pressure, given that Pacific salmonids are semelparous (single opportunity to spawn). Consequently, these fishes optimize energy expenditures in a number of ways: strong homing, precise migration timing, choosing forward-assist current paths and exploiting the boundary layer to avoid the strong currents in the middle of the river, using energetically efficient swimming speeds, and recovering rapidly from anaerobic swimming. Upon arrival at the spawning ground, remaining energy can be strategically allocated to the various spawning behaviours. Strong fidelity to natal streams has resulted in reproductively isolated populations that appear to be locally adapted physiologically to their specific environmental conditions. Populations with more challenging migrations have enhanced cardiorespiratory performance. Pacific salmonids are able to maintain aerobic scope across the broad range of temperatures encountered historically during their migration; however, climate change-induced river warming has created lethal conditions for many populations, raising conservation concerns. Despite considerable research examining cardiorespiratory physiology in Pacific salmonids over the last 70 years, critical knowledge gaps are identified.",2016,"aerobic scope; energetics; local adaptation; migration; oxygen consumption; temperature","Article","ISI"

We tested for latitudinal clines in two complex phenotypic traits - thermal tolerance and body size - and one single locus trait - heat shock cognate 70 (HSC70) - in L. keenae along almost its entire geographical range. We found only weak evidence for a latitudinal cline in the thermal tolerance and no evidence for a cline in allele frequencies at HSC70. However, as predicted by Bergmann's rule, we detected a strong latitudinal cline that accounted for 60% of the variance in body size (R2 = 0.598; P < 0.001). In contrast, body size did not significantly affect thermal tolerance. HSC70 showed no genetic differentiation among the populations, supporting our previous mitochondrial gene-based estimate of high gene flow during this snail's free-swimming larval stage.

This effect is expected to be modulated by other global change factors, and to be different for populations adapted to different environments. A common garden experimental approach using freshwater green macroalgae, the cosmopolitan charophyte species Chara hispida and C. vulgaris, allowed us to test whether the beneficial increases in water temperature (T) and nitrate concentration (N) mitigate negative UVR effects. Also, whether these interactions would be not only species-specific but also according to the origin of the population; therefore, two populations of each species were used: one from a coastal wetland and the other from a mountain lake. Two factorial-design experiments were performed: (i) the presence and absence of UVR x lower and higher T x four populations, and (ii) the presence and absence of UVR x lower and higher N x four populations. Response variables were: growth, morphometry, UVR-protective compounds, photosynthetic pigments, and stoichiometric composition. There were consistent response patterns in the key variables that represent different organization levels. Our main results showed that both warming and, to a lesser extent, the increase in nutrients ameliorated the negative effects of UVR on the molecular processes involved in acclimation to UVR, and that such a mitigating effect depended on the different phenotypic plasticity of each species and each ecotype. The coastal populations, being from a more variable environment, were more resilient than the mountain populations, mainly because of changes in growth and morphology.",2019,"charophyceae; common garden; global change; local adaptation; mediterranean region; photoprotection; plasticity","Article","ISI"

Phragmites australis is a dominant ecosystem engineer with broad distribution, high intraspecific variation and great socio-economic importance. Coastal ecosystems inhabited by P. australis are threatened by salinization. Here, we investigated salinity tolerance of freshwater and salt marsh population of the species, grown under two soil salinities and in two common gardens. Salinity significantly affected the growth, biomass, leaf physiological parameters and ion concentration. Climate altered morphology and ion concentration of P. australis. In contrast to our hypothesis, the salt marsh population was not more salt tolerant than the freshwater population, and both showed a low degree of salt stress, maintaining their photosynthesis and chlorophyll concentration, and only showing small decreases in biomass and height when salt-treated. We therefore ruled out local adaptation to soil salinity. Instead, both populations acclimated by phenotypic plasticity of biomass, root: shoot ratio, stomatal conductance and ion content. The salinity tolerance strategy of both populations was ion concentration by tissue desiccation, which was most efficient in the drier climate common garden. Hence, plants utilizing tissue desiccation as salinity tolerance strategy will have an advantage in areas where climate change leads to drier air humidity.",2021,"compatible osmolytes; intraspecific diversity; local adaptation; phenotypic plasticity; salinity tolerance; yellow river delta","Article","ISI"
"Intraspecific variation in the growth and survival of juvenile fish exposed to Eucalyptus leachate","10.1002/ece3.757","Morrongiello, JR; Bond, NR; Crook, DA; Wong, BBM","Whilst changes in freshwater assemblages along gradients of environmental stress have been relatively well studied, we know far less about intraspecific variation to these same stressors. A stressor common in fresh waters worldwide is leachates from terrestrial plants. Leachates alter the physiochemical environment of fresh waters by lowering pH and dissolved oxygen and also releasing toxic compounds such as polyphenols and tannins, all of which can be detrimental to aquatic organisms. We investigated how chronic exposure to Eucalyptus leaf leachate affected the growth and survival of juvenile southern pygmy perch (Nannoperca australis) collected from three populations with different litter inputs, hydrology and observed leachate concentrations. Chronic exposure to elevated leachate levels negatively impacted growth and survival, but the magnitude of these lethal and sublethal responses was conditional on body size and source population. Bigger fish had increased survival at high leachate levels but overall slower growth rates. Body size also varied among populations and fish from the population exposed to the lowest natural leachate concentrations had the highest average stress tolerance. Significant intraspecific variation in both growth and survival caused by Eucalyptus leachate exposure indicates that the magnitude (but not direction) of these stress responses varies across the landscape. This raises the potential for leachate-induced selection to operate at an among-population scale. The importance of body size demonstrates that the timing of leachate exposure during ontogeny is central in determining the magnitude of biological response, with early life stages being most vulnerable. Overall, we demonstrate that Eucalyptus leachates are prevalent and potent selective agents that can trigger important sublethal impacts, beyond those associated with more familiar fish kills, and reiterate that dissolved organic carbon is more than just an energy source in aquatic environments.",2013,"blackwater; dissolved organic carbon; local adaptation; nannoperca australis; plant secondary metabolite","Article","ISI"
"Genomic evidence of population genetic differentiation in deep-sea squat lobster Shinkaia crosnieri (crustacea: Decapoda: Anomura) from Northwestern Pacific hydrothermal vent and cold seep","10.1016/j.dsr.2019.103188","Cheng, J; Hui, M; Li, YL; Sha, ZL","The galatheid squat lobster, Shinkaia crosnieri Baba and Williams, 1998, is one of the few dominant species inhabiting both deep-sea hydrothermal vents and cold seeps. Here, we used mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (mtDNA COI) and nuclear genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) as genetic markers to investigate genetic connectivity of S. crosnieri populations from a hydrothermal vent of Okinawa Through and a cold seep of the South China Sea. MtDNA COI sequence analyses indicated that deep-sea vent population of S. crosnieri was genetically divergent from cold seep population. To obtain deep insights into the evolutionary forces driving this genetic break, we performed restriction-site associated DNA analysis to evaluate the extent of genetic differentiation in S. crosnieri inhabiting both environments on a genome-wide scale, and to assess the role of selective processes in shaping this pattern. Using the assembled survey genome of S. crosnieri as a reference, 12,963 SNPs were identified for 30 S. crosnieri specimens. The structural and principle component analyses based on SNPs supported genetic differentiation between the vent and seep populations. Evidence for local adaptation of S. crosnieri populations was confirmed by identifying increased population divergence using F-sT-based outlier tests, which resulted in 54 potentially locally selected SNPs, indicative of an important role for natural selection as a driver of genetic divergence in this species. Further studies revealed that candidate genes containing outlier SNPs were involved in diverse biological processes, including immunity, transposon and metabolic processes. Overall, our results demonstrated significant genetic divergence between the vent and seep S. crosnieri populations in the Northwestern Pacific and provided clues to understand potential genetic basis underlying local adaptation in S. crosnieri during colonization into deep-sea chemosynthetic ecosystems.",2020,"chemosynthetic fauna; population connectivity; local adaptation; single nucleotide polymorphism; cytochrome c oxidase subunit i","Article","ISI"

The recent development of cost-effective methods for obtaining high-quality genome-scale data makes it possible to identify some of the loci responsible for adaptive differences among populations. Two basic approaches for identifying putatively locally adaptive loci have been developed and are broadly used: one that identifies loci with unusually high genetic differentiation among populations (differentiation outlier methods) and one that searches for correlations between local population allele frequencies and local environments (genetic-environment association methods). Here, we review the promises and challenges of these genome scan methods, including correcting for the confounding influence of a species' demographic history, biases caused by missing aspects of the genome, matching scales of environmental data with population structure, and other statistical considerations. In each case, we make suggestions for best practices for maximizing the accuracy and efficiency of genome scans to detect the underlying genetic basis of local adaptation.

"Local adaptation studies and conservation: Parasite-host interactions between the endangered freshwater mussel Unio crassus and its host fish","10.1002/aqc.2816","Schneider, LD; Nilsson, PA; Hojesjo, J; Osterling, EM","Parasite-host interactions can involve strong reciprocal selection pressure, and may lead to locally adapted specializations. The highly threatened unionoid mussels are temporary parasites on fish, but local adaptation has not yet been investigated for many species. Patterns of local adaptation of one of Europe's most threatened unionoids, the thick-shelled river mussel (Unio crassus) were investigated. Eurasian minnows (Phoxinus phoxinus) from two rivers (separate drainage areas) were cross-infested in the laboratory with sympatric and allopatric mussel larvae, while bullheads (Cottus gobio), inhabiting only one of the rivers, were infested with sympatric or allopatric mussel larvae. Larval encystment, juvenile mussel excystment and survival were measured. For one river, but not the other, juvenile excystment from P. phoxinus was highest when infested with sympatric mussels. The opposite pattern was found for C. gobio in this river, where juvenile excystment and post-parasitic juvenile survival from allopatric C. gobio were highest. The results thus cannot confirm local adaptation of U. crassus to P. phoxinus in the study rivers, as excystment was not consistently higher in all sympatric mussel-host combinations, whereas there were potential maladaptive signs of U. crassus in relation to C. gobio. There was no loss of encysted larvae 3 days after infestation until juvenile excystment. Most juveniles were excysted between 17 and 29 days after infestation, and the numbers of excysted juveniles increased with fish size. The results have implications for parasite-host ecology and conservation management with regard to unionoid propagation and re-introduction. This includes the need to (1) test suitability and adaptation patterns between U. crassus and multiple host fish species, (2) evaluate the suitability of certain unionoids and host fish strains after more than 3 days, and (3) determine whether large fish produce more juvenile mussels than smaller fish.",2017,"conservation; host fish; local adaptation; parasite-host interaction; threatened species; unio crassus","Article","ISI"

Using an analysis of molecular variance framework, we tested whether populations were more structured by geographic distance or environmental extremes. The genetic patterns we observed followed isolation by environment, where nearshore and adjacent offshore populations showed significant genetic structure at both locations (AMOVA F-ST = 0.04 similar to 0.19, P < 0.001), but no significant isolation by distance between islands. Strikingly, corals from the two nearshore sites with higher levels of environmental stressors on different islands over 100 km apart with similar environmentally stressful conditions were genetically closer (F-ST = 0.0, P = 0.73) than those within a single location less than 2 km apart (F-ST = 0.04 similar to 0.08, P < 0.01). In contrast, a third site with a less impacted nearshore site (i.e., less pronounced environmental gradient) showed no significant structure from the offshore comparison. Our results show much stronger support for environment than distance separating these populations. Our finding suggests that ecological boundaries from human impacts may play a role in forming genetic structure in the coastal environment, and that genetic divergence in the absence of geographical barriers to gene flow might be explained by selective pressure across contrasting habitats.",2020,"coral reefs; anthropogenic impacts; population genetics; hawaii; lobe coral; isolation by distance; isolation by environment; local adaptation; gene flow","Article","ISI"

In California estuaries, O. lurida is adapted to local salinity regimes and populations differ in low salinity tolerance. In this study, oysters from three California populations were reared for two generations in a laboratory common garden and subsequently exposed to low salinity seawater. Comparative transcriptomics was then used to understand species-level responses to hyposmotic stress and population-level mechanisms underlying divergent salinity tolerances. Gene expression patterns indicate Olympia oysters are sensitive to hyposmotic stress: All populations respond to low salinity by up-regulating transcripts indicative of protein unfolding, DNA damage and cell cycle arrest after sub-lethal exposure. Among O. lurida populations, transcriptomic profiles differed constitutively and in response to low salinity. Despite two generations in common-garden conditions, transcripts encoding apoptosis modulators were constitutively expressed at significantly different levels in the most tolerant population. Expression of cell death regulators may facilitate cell fate decisions when salinity declines. Following low salinity exposure, oysters from the more tolerant population expressed a small number of mRNAs at significantly higher levels than less tolerant populations. Proteins encoded by these transcripts regulate ciliary activity within the mantle cavity and may function to prolong valve closure and reduce mortality in low salinity seawater. Collectively, gene expression patterns suggest sub-lethal impacts of hyposmotic stress in Olympia oysters are considerable and that even oysters with greater low salinity tolerance may be vulnerable to future freshwater flooding events.",2018,"climate change; local adaptation; oyster; rna-seq; salinity; transcriptome","Article","ISI"

Performance traits and environmental tolerance limits are predicted to be related to the typical abiotic and biotic conditions encountered by each population. Endurance swim performance at three different temperatures (8, 12, 22 degrees C) was compared across nine populations of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka (Walbaum, 1792)) parr from British Columbia, Canada, reared in a common laboratory environment. In addition, relative ventricular mass (RVM) was compared between good and poor performers from each population. Populations significantly differed in endurance swim performance and these differences were related to the natal lake environment. Specifically, parr populations that reside in warm, shallow lakes (Okanagan, Scotch, and Stellako) had superior swim performance at 12 degrees C compared with 8 degrees C. All other populations from deeper, cooler lakes had equivalent swim performance at 8 and 12 degrees C. Individual variability in swim performance within a population was not due to differences in cardiac size. Similarly, RVM did not vary across parr populations, suggesting that population differences in swim performance were not associated with cardiac size.

This harmful aquatic invasive species is a predatory freshwater fish native to northeastern Asia that, following deliberate introduction, has established itself in multiple water basins in the eastern United States, as well as expanding its range into the Midwest. Previous work assessed the population structure and estimated the long-term effective population sizes of the populations present in the United States, but the source of the initial introduction(s) to the U.S. remains unidentified. Building on earlier work, we used whole genome scans (2b-RAD genomic sequencing) to analyze single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from C. argus to screen the genomes of these invasive fish from United States waters and from three sites in their native range in China. We recovered 2,822 SNP loci from genomic DNA extracted from 164 fish sampled from the eastern United States and Arkansas (Mississippi River basin), plus 30 fish sampled from three regions of the Yangtze River basin in China (n = 10 individuals per basin). Our results provide evidence supporting the Yangtze River basin in China, specifically the Bohu and/or Liangzi lakes, is a likely source of the C. argus introductions in multiple regions of the U.S., including the Lower Hudson River basin, Upper Hudson River basin and Philadelphia (Lower Delaware River basin). This information, in conjunction with additional sampling from the native range, will help to determine the source(s) of introduction for the other U.S. populations.

To investigate the relative importance of acclimation versus site of origin in shaping previously observed differences in coral tolerance limits at Ofu Island, specimens of the common Indo-Pacific coral Porites lobata from locations with differing levels of thermal variability were acclimated to low and high thermal variation in controlled common garden aquaria. Overall, there were minimal effects of the acclimation exposure. Corals native to the site with the highest level of daily variability grew fastest, regardless of acclimation treatment. When exposed to lethal thermal stress, corals native to both variable sites contained elevated levels of heat shock proteins and maintained photosynthetic performance for 1-2 days longer than corals from the stable environment.

However, genetic structure can exist naturally at small scales through processes other than isolation by physical barriers. We sampled individuals from five native fish species with varying life histories above and below a dam in the lower Boardman River, Michigan, USA, and used RADseq to investigate processes influencing genetic structure in this system. Species assessed were white sucker Catostomus commersonii, yellow perch Perca flavescens, walleye Sander vitreus, smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu, and rock bass Ambloplites rupestris. We detected significant differentiation within each species, but patterns of population structure varied substantially. Interestingly, genetic structure did not appear to be solely the result of fragmentation by the dam. While genetic structure in yellow perch and walleye generally coincided with above dam and below dam sampling locations, samples from our other three species did not. Specifically, samples from rock bass, smallmouth bass, and, to a much lesser extent, white sucker, aligned with a putative Great Lakes (GL) group that contained mostly individuals sampled below the dam and a putative Boardman River (BR) group that contained individuals sampled both above and below the dam, with some evidence of admixture among groups. We hypothesize that the GL and BR groups formed prior to dam construction and our samples largely represent a mixed stock that was sampled sympatrically outside of the spawning season. Support for this hypothesis is especially strong in smallmouth bass, where GL fish were 151 mm smaller than BR fish on average, suggesting a potential ontogenetic habitat shift of young GL fish into the lower river for feeding and/or refuge.

Solutions to improving coastal governance include the implementation of Integrated Coastal Management which also serves as means to plan and achieve climate change adaptation. This paper proposes the establishment of a framework and methodology to assess local coastal governance based on a composite of hierarchical metrics formed by different forms of capital and associated factors and indicators. The application of this methodology resulted in the description of a baseline for local coastal governance. This baseline is useful for informing different functional levels within local government, e.g. technical, managerial and political. The baseline consisted of a comprehensive assessment of the different forms of capitals furthered categorized by factors and measured by indicators of local coastal governance. The capitals approach and method for measuring governance is potentially repeatable and can identify progress towards longer-term coastal management and climate adaptation goals as well as areas requiring improvements. Ultimately, it can be developed into a self-assessment tool to help local government to think reflexively about how they are managing the coast and the climate risks impacting on coastal assets and people.",2020,"local coastal governance; capital assessment framework; climate change adaptation; integrated coastal management; western indian ocean; south africa","Article","ISI"
"Modeling local adaptation and gene flow in sockeye salmon","10.1002/ecs2.2039","Lin, JE; Hard, JJ; Hilborn, R; Hauser, L","Microevolutionary processes determine levels of local adaptation within populations and presumably affect population productivity, but selection and phenotypic evolution have not often been linked explicitly to population dynamics in the wild. Here, we describe a stochastic, individual-based model that simulates evolutionary and demographic effects of migration and selection in interconnected sockeye salmon populations. Two populations were simulated based on parameters obtained empirically from wild populations in the Bristol Bay region of southwestern Alaska, representing beach-and stream-spawning ecotypes. Individuals underwent a full salmonid life cycle, experiencing sexual selection, size-selective harvest, and predation based on body size at maturity. Stabilizing natural selection on the three traits (body length, body depth, and age at maturity) tracked for all individuals favored different phenotypes in the two ecotype populations, and the three traits evolved in a genetically correlated manner. Simulation results showed that stabilizing selection on fish phenotypes was always critical for maintaining local adaptation, especially when dispersal rates were high, but loss of local adaptation did not result in substantial loss of productivity. Rather, productivity was more strongly influenced by the opposing effects of stabilizing and harvest selection; strong stabilizing selection caused the salmon to evolve larger body sizes that made them more likely to be caught in the fishery. The model results suggest that interactions between different selection pressures can have substantial demographic as well as evolutionary consequences in wild salmon populations, with key implications for sustainability of natural production in the face of selective harvest and systemic environmental change.",2017,"gene flow; human-induced evolution; individual-based model; local adaptation; natural selection; population dynamics","Article","ISI"
"Ecotypic differences in the phenology of the tundra species Eriophorum vaginatum reflect sites of origin","10.1002/ece3.3445","Parker, TC; Tang, JW; Clark, MB; Moody, MM; Fetcher, N","Eriophorum vaginatum is a tussock-forming sedge that contributes significantly to the structure and primary productivity of moist acidic tussock tundra. Locally adapted populations (ecotypes) have been identified across the geographical distribution of E.vaginatum; however, little is known about how their growth and phenology differ over the course of a growing season. The growing season is short in the Arctic and therefore exerts a strong selection pressure on tundra species. This raises the hypothesis that the phenology of arctic species may be poorly adapted if the timing and length of the growing season change. Mature E.vaginatum tussocks from across a latitudinal gradient (65-70 degrees N) were transplanted into a common garden at a central location (Toolik Lake, 68 degrees 38N, 149 degrees 36W) where half were warmed using open-top chambers. Over two growing seasons (2015 and 2016), leaf length was measured weekly to track growth rates, timing of senescence, and biomass accumulation. Growth rates were similar across ecotypes and between years and were not affected by warming. However, southern populations accumulated significantly more biomass, largely because they started to senesce later. In 2016, peak biomass and senescence of most populations occurred later than in 2015, probably induced by colder weather at the beginning of the growing season in 2016, which caused a delayed start to growth. The finish was delayed as well. Differences in phenology between populations were largely retained between years, suggesting that the amount of time that these ecotypes grow has been selected by the length of the growing seasons at their respective home sites. As potential growing seasons lengthen, E.vaginatum may be unable to respond appropriately as a result of genetic control and may have reduced fitness in the rapidly warming Arctic tundra.",2017,"arctic tundra; common garden; ecotypes; eriophorum vaginatum; growing season length; local adaptation; phenology; senescence","Article","ISI"

The filter feeding copepod Eurytemora affinis is an abundant and important zooplankton in coastal waters that consist of a cryptic species complex with locally adapted populations. We used a mesocosm setup to investigate population and ecosystem interactions of two populations from the Baltic Sea with different morphology and life history traits. One population is laterally wider, larger-sized, more fecund, and have higher growth rate than the other. The experimental ecosystems varied in algae community (pelagic algae, and pelagic algae + benthic diatoms) with two resource supply scenarios. Results showed that the large-sized population is a more effective grazer. In low resource supply the small-sized population starved, whereas the large-sized population was unaffected, resulting in a larger population increase of both nauplii and copepodites than for the small-sized population. Addition of benthic diatoms to the pelagic algae community had much more negative effects on the reproduction of the large-sized population. This suggests that the large-sized population feeds near benthic to a greater extent than the small-sized population, and that filamentous benthic diatoms interfere with the grazing process. Despite the negative effects of benthic diatoms, the large-sized population could maintain similar or higher reproduction than the small-sized population. In addition, the high grazing efficiency of the large-sized population resulted in a different community composition of algae. Specifically, flagellated species and small sized benthic diatoms were more grazed upon by the large-sized population. Our results show that morphologically divergent, yet phylogenetically closely related zooplankton populations can have different ecosystem functions, and in turn have different population increase in response to resource supply and algae community.",2018,"local adaptation; common gardening experiment; intraspecific variation; ecological-evolutionary dynamics; resource specialization; morphological divergence; niche partitioning; size efficiency","Article","ISI"

Evidence for the frequent occurrence of diverging ecotypes in species that inhabit multiple ecological habitats is accumulating, but experimental approaches to understanding the biological pathways as well as the underlying genetic mechanisms are still rare. Parasites are invoked as one of the major selective forces driving evolution and are themselves dependent on the ecological conditions in a given habitat. Immunological adaptation to local parasite communities is therefore expected to be a key component of local adaptation in natural populations. Here, we use next-generation sequencing technology to compare the transcriptome-wide response of experimentally infected three-spined sticklebacks from a lake and a river population, which are known to evolve under selection by distinct parasite communities. By comparing overall gene expression levels as well as the activation of functional pathways in response to parasite exposure, we identified potential differences between the two stickleback populations at several levels.

Although many studies have focussed on survival and mortality in response to specific physiological stresses, little attention has been paid to the role of genetic heritability of traits and local adaptation in influencing patterns of plant mortality, especially in non-native species. Tamarix spp. is a dominant, non-native riparian tree in western North America that is experiencing dieback in some areas of its range due to episodic herbivory by the recently introduced northern tamarisk leaf beetle (Diorhabda carinulata). We propose that genotype x environment interactions largely underpin current and future patterns of Tamarix mortality. We anticipate that (i) despite its recent introduction, and the potential for significant gene flow, Tamarix in western North America is generally adapted to local environmental conditions across its current range in part due to hybridization of two species; (ii) local adaptation to specific climate, soil and resource availability will yield predictable responses to episodic herbivory; and (iii) the ability to cope with a combination of episodic herbivory and increased aridity associated with climate change will be largely based on functional tradeoffs in resource allocation. This review focusses on the potential heritability of plant carbon allocation patterns in Tamarix, focussing on the relative contribution of acquired carbon to non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) pools versus other sinks as the basis for surviving episodic disturbance. Where high aridity and/or poor edaphic position lead to chronic stress, NSC pools may fall below a minimum threshold because of an imbalance between the supply of carbon and its demand by various sinks. Identifying patterns of local adaptation of traits related to resource allocation will improve forecasting of Tamarix population susceptibility to episodic herbivory.",2017,"carbon allocation; climate change; diorhabda carinulata; local adaptation; non-structural carbohydrates; tamarix","Article","ISI"

This indicates that early life stages of E. lucius tolerate ambient salinity conditions equivalent to the natural environment in its nursery area in the Stege Nor lagoon. The population should therefore not be dependent on access to freshwater environments during spawning.

We performed an integrative field and experimental study using three-spined stickleback river and lake ecotypes. We characterized their parasite load and variation at MHC class II loci. Fish from lakes and rivers harbor contrasting parasite communities and populations possess different MHC allele pools that could be the result of a combined action of genetic drift and parasite-mediated selection. We show that individual MHC class II diversity varies among populations and is lower in river ecotypes. Our results suggest the action of homogenizing selection within habitat type and diverging selection between habitat types.

When such divergence occurs within foundation species, then it might impact community structure and ecosystem function and cause other cascading ecological effects. We tested for parallel microgeographic trait and genetic divergence in Spartina alterniflora, a foundation species that dominates salt marshes of the US Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Spartina is characterized by tall-form (1-2 m) plants at lower tidal elevations and short-form (<0.5 m) plants at higher tidal elevations, yet whether this trait variation reflects plastic and/or genetically differentiated responses to these environmental conditions remains unclear. In the greenhouse, seedlings raised from tall-form plants grew taller than those from short-form plants, indicating a heritable difference in height. When we reciprocally transplanted seedlings back into the field for a growing season, composite fitness (survivorship and seed production) and key plant traits (plant height and biomass allocation) differed interactively across origin and transplant zones in a manner indicative of local adaptation. Further, a survey of single nucleotide polymorphisms revealed repeated, independent genetic differentiation between tall- and short-form Spartina at five of six tested marshes across the native range. The observed parallel, microgeographic genetic differentiation in Spartina likely underpins marsh health and functioning and provides an underappreciated mechanism that might increase capacity of marshes to adapt to rising sea levels.",2021,"local adaptation; fine-scale genetic differentiation; parallel evolution; spartina alterniflora; intraspecific variation; salt marsh","Article","ISI"

Here, we provide empirical support for a negative effect of pollution on Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) population dynamics in coastal waters of Norway by combining unique time series of juvenile cod abundance, body size, environmental concentration of toxic contaminants and a spatially structured population dynamics model. The study shows that mercury concentration might have decreased the reproductive potential of cod in the region despite the general decline in the environmental concentration of mercury, cadmium and hexachlorobenzene since the implementation of national environmental laws. However, some cod populations appeared to be more resistant to mercury pollution than others, and the strength and shape of mercury effect on cod reproductive potential was fjord-specific. Additionally, cod growth rate changed at scales smaller than fjords with a gradient related to the exposure to the open ocean and offshore cod. These spatial differences in life-history traits emphasize the importance of local adaptation in shaping the dynamics of local wildlife populations. Finally, this study highlights the possibility to mitigate pollution effects on natural populations by reducing the overall pollution level, but also reveals that pollution reduction alone is not enough to rebuild local cod populations.

"Comparative genomics approach to evolutionary process connectivity","10.1111/eva.12978","Gagnaire, PA","The influence of species life history traits and historical demography on contemporary connectivity is still poorly understood. However, these factors partly determine the evolutionary responses of species to anthropogenic landscape alterations. Genetic connectivity and its evolutionary outcomes depend on a variety of spatially dependent evolutionary processes, such as population structure, local adaptation, genetic admixture, and speciation. Over the last years, population genomic studies have been interrogating these processes with increasing resolution, revealing a large diversity of species responses to spatially structured landscapes. In parallel, multispecies meta-analyses usually based on low-genome coverage data have provided fundamental insights into the ecological determinants of genetic connectivity, such as the influence of key life history traits on population structure. However, comparative studies still lack a thorough integration of macro- and micro-evolutionary scales to fully realize their potential. Here, I present how a comparative genomics framework may provide a deeper understanding of evolutionary process connectivity. This framework relies on coupling the inference of long-term demographic and selective history with an assessment of the contemporary consequences of genetic connectivity. Standardizing this approach across several species occupying the same landscape should help understand how spatial environmental heterogeneity has shaped the diversity of historical and contemporary connectivity patterns in different taxa with contrasted life history traits. I will argue that a reasonable amount of genome sequence data can be sufficient to resolve and connect complex macro- and micro-evolutionary histories. Ultimately, implementing this framework in varied taxonomic groups is expected to improve scientific guidelines for conservation and management policies.",2020,"comparative population genomics; conservation and management; demographic history; genetic connectivity; life history traits; whole-genome resequencing","Article","ISI"
"Historical thermal regimes define limits to coral acclimatization","10.1890/12-1257.1","Howells, EJ; Berkelmans, R; van Oppen, MJH; Willis, BL; Bay, LK","Knowledge of the degree to which corals undergo physiological acclimatization or genetic adaptation in response to changes in their thermal environment is crucial to the success of coral reef conservation strategies. The potential of corals to acclimatize to temperatures exceeding historical thermal regimes was investigated by reciprocal transplantation of Acropora millepora colonies between the warm central and cool southern regions of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) for a duration of 14 months. Colony fragments retained at native sites remained healthy, whereas transplanted fragments, although healthy over initial months when temperatures remained within native thermal regimes, subsequently bleached and suffered mortality during seasonal temperature extremes. Corals hosting Symbiodinium D transplanted to the southern GBR bleached in winter and the majority suffered whole (40%; n = 20 colonies) or partial (50%) mortality at temperatures 1.1 degrees C below their 15-year native minimum. In contrast, corals hosting Symbiodinium C2 transplanted to the central GBR bleached in summer and suffered whole (50%; n = 10 colonies) or partial (42%) mortality at temperatures 2.5 degrees C above their 15-year native maximum. During summer bleaching, the dominant Symbiodinium type changed from C2 to D within corals transplanted to the central GBR. Corals transplanted to the cooler, southern GBR grew 74-80% slower than corals at their native site, and only 50% of surviving colonies reproduced, at least partially because of cold water bleaching of transplants. Despite the absence of any visual signs of stress, corals transplanted to the warmer, central GBR grew 52-59% more slowly than corals at their native site before the summer bleaching (i.e., from autumn to spring). Allocation of energy to initial acclimatization or reproduction may explain this pattern, as the majority (65%) of transplants reproduced one month earlier than portions of the same colonies retained at the southern native site. All parameters investigated (bleaching, mortality, Symbiodinium type fidelity, reproductive timing) demonstrated strong interactions between genotype and environment, indicating that the acclimatization potential of A. millepora populations may be limited by adaptation of the holobiont to native thermal regimes.",2013,"acclimatization; acropora millepora; assisted migration; coral; coral bleaching; coral mortality; great barrier reef, australia; local adaptation; sea temperature rise; symbiodinium; thermal tolerance; zooxanthellae","Article","ISI"

Highly significant correlations between present abundance and estimates of genomic vulnerability - the mismatch between current and predicted future genotype-environment relationships - indicate small, fragmented populations of the southwestern willow flycatcher will have to adapt most to keep pace with climate change.

"Social context, but not individual personality, alters immigrant viability in a spider with mixed social structure","10.1016/j.anbehav.2016.08.009","Ingley, SJ; Pruitt, JN; Scharf, I; Purcell, J","Immigrant viability is a major determinant of the realized rate of gene flow across populations. For social organisms, the social context in which immigrants disperse across contrasting environments may have important implications for their viability post dispersal. Here, we use social spiders whose individual personalities as well as group personality compositions vary across sites to test whether the strength of selection against immigrants (i.e. mortality rates) differs depending on whether spiders are transplanted (1) as individuals and remain alone, (2) join pre-existing colonies at their new non-native environment, or (3) move with their native group. We also tested for an effect of individual personality on survival. We found that social context, and not individual personality, affects individual survival in foreign environments with contrasting resource levels. Individuals that were transplanted with their native groups suffered higher mortality rates compared to individuals transplanted as singletons, regardless of whether or not they were assimilated into native colonies. Moving as individuals could thus provide an avenue for ongoing gene flow among populations from different resource environments. We found no depressed performance of control colonies that were transplanted across sites with resource levels similar to each colony's site of origin. These results are at odds with the intuition that dispersing as a group should generally enhance the viability of immigrants, at least in social species. We propose that these results could be explained by a mismatch in the ideal group compositions (personality compositions) favoured in different environments, despite a lack of selection on individual personality traits. These results provide a first glimpse into the relative roles of individual personality and social context in mediating gene flow among populations from divergent environments.

Cane toad tissue samples were collected along broad-scale, core-to-edge transects across their invasive range. Geographic and ecological core areas were identified using GIS and habitat suitability indices from ecological niche modelling. Bayesian clustering analyses revealed three genetic clusters, in the northwest invasion-front region, northeast precipitation-limited region and southeast cold temperature-limited region. Core-to-edge patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation were consistent with the CMH in the southeast, but were not supported in the northeast and showed mixed support in the northwest. Results suggest cold temperatures are a likely contributor to southeastern range limits, consistent with CMH predictions.

Due to climate change and overfishing, the clupeid stocks of Lake Tanganyika are declining. We investigate the population structure of the Lake Tanganyika sprat Stolothrissa tanganicae, using for the first time a genomic approach on this species. This is an important step towards knowing if the species should be managed separately or as a single stock. Population structure is important for fisheries management, yet understudied for many African freshwater species. We hypothesize that distinct stocks of S. tanganicae could be present due to the large size of the lake (isolation by distance), limnological variation (adaptive evolution), or past separation of the lake (historical subdivision). On the other hand, high mobility of the species and lack of obvious migration barriers might have resulted in a homogenous population.ResultsWe performed a population genetic study on wild-caught S. tanganicae through a combination of mitochondrial genotyping (96 individuals) and RAD sequencing (83 individuals). Samples were collected at five locations along a north-south axis of Lake Tanganyika. The mtDNA data had low global FST and, visualised in a haplotype network, did not show phylogeographic structure. RAD sequencing yielded a panel of 3504 SNPs, with low genetic differentiation (F-ST=0.0054; 95% CI: 0.0046-0.0066). PCoA, fineRADstructure and global F-ST suggest a near-panmictic population. Two distinct groups are apparent in these analyses (F-ST=0.1338 95% CI: 0.1239,0.1445), which do not correspond to sampling locations. Autocorrelation analysis showed a slight increase in genetic difference with increasing distance. No outlier loci were detected in the RADseq data.ConclusionOur results show at most very weak geographical structuring of the stock and do not provide evidence for genetic adaptation to historical or environmental differences over a north-south axis. Based on these results, we advise to manage the stock as one population, integrating one management strategy over the four riparian countries.

Given the commercial importance of this species, management is critical: in 1997, the southern Gulf of Mexico pink shrimp fishery was declared collapsed and mitigation strategies went into effect, with recovery efforts lasting over a decade. Fisheries management can be informed and improved through a better understanding of how factors associated with early life history impact genetic diversity and population structure in the recruited population. Farfantepenaeus duorarum are short-lived, but highly fecund, and display high variability in recruitment patterns. To date, modeling the impacts of ecological, physical, and behavioral factors on juvenile settlement has focused on recruitment of larval individuals of F. duorarum to nursery grounds in Florida Bay. Here, we articulate testable hypotheses stemming from a recent model of larval transport and evaluate support for each with a population genomics approach, generating reduced representation library sequencing data for F. duorarum collected from seven regions around the Florida Peninsula. Our research represents the first and most molecular data-rich study of population structure in F. duorarum in the Gulf and reveals evidence of a differentiated population in the Dry Tortugas. Our approach largely validates a model of larval transport, allowing us to make management-informative inferences about the impacts of spawning location and recruitment patterns on intraspecific genetic diversity.

In this study, we employed AFLP to investigate the genetic structure of Ammodytes personatus and compared the genetic variation of A. personatus in different ocean current systems. The incongruence between nuclear clades and previous mitochondrial lineages suggested that A. personatus is indeed composed of at least two genetically divergent cryptic species. Our results demonstrate that intra-species diversity should be taken into account to assess the influence of climate change on species. This study also highlights the value of the natural physical setting created by warm and cold ocean currents in eliciting a correlation between temperature and species distribution. In future studies, the exact range of temperature in both groups must be assessed with a sufficient number of samples to predict the influences of global climate change on both groups. Abstract The use of molecular techniques in biodiversity research increasingly results in the recognition of multiple divergent mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) lineages below the morphospecies level. However, the overlapping distribution of multiple divergent lineages raises the question of whether some of these lineages are in fact cryptic species. Assessing the status of these divergent lineages, delimiting evolutionarily significant units (ESUs), and identifying the dominant evolutionary and ecological drivers are critical components of successful wildlife conservation and management strategies. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers were applied to characterize the phylogeography pattern of a cold water species, the Japanese sand lance Ammodytes personatus, in warm and cold ocean currents. A total of 211 individuals sampled from 12 populations through the species' range, including samples from Kuroshio Current, Oyashio Current, Tsushima Current, and Yellow Sea, were analyzed. The Bayesian assignment probability test and Neighbor joining (NJ) analysis divided these populations into two genetically and geographically distinct clades (northern and southern clades) characterized by different sea surface temperatures. The incongruence between nuclear clades and previous mitochondrial lineages suggested that A. personatus is indeed composed of at least two genetically divergent cryptic species.

"Molecular mechanisms of local adaptation for salt-tolerance in a treefrog","10.1111/mec.15867","Albecker, MA; Stuckert, AMM; Balakrishnan, CN; McCoy, MW","Salinization is a global phenomenon affecting ecosystems and forcing freshwater organisms to deal with increasing levels of ionic stress. However, our understanding of mechanisms that permit salt tolerance in amphibians is limited. This study investigates mechanisms of salt tolerance in locally adapted, coastal populations of a treefrog, Hyla cinerea. Using a common garden experiment, we (i) determine the extent that environment (i.e., embryonic and larval saltwater exposure) or genotype (i.e., coastal vs. inland) affects developmental benchmarks and transcriptome expression, and (ii) identify genes that may underpin differences in saltwater tolerance. Differences in gene expression, survival, and plasma osmolality were most strongly associated with genotype. Population genetic analyses on expressed genes also delineated coastal and inland groups based on genetic similarity. Coastal populations differentially expressed osmoregulatory genes including ion transporters (atp1b1, atp6V1g2, slc26a), cellular adhesion components (cdh26, cldn1, gjb3, ocln), and cytoskeletal components (odc1-a, tgm3). Several of these genes are the same genes expressed by euryhaline fish after exposure to freshwater, which is a novel finding for North American amphibians and suggests that these genes may be associated with local salinity adaptation. Coastal populations also highly expressed glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1 (gpd1), which indicates they use glycerol as a compatible osmolyte to reduce water loss - another mechanism of saltwater tolerance previously unknown in frogs. These data signify that Hyla cinerea inhabiting coastal, brackish wetlands have evolved a salt-tolerant ecotype, and highlights novel candidate pathways that can lead to salt tolerance in freshwater organisms facing habitat salinization.",2021,"amphibian; aquaporin; gene expression; glycerol; local adaptation; phenotypic plasticity; saltwater tolerance; sodium potassium pump","Article","ISI"

Several populations of this species have successfully adapted to environments contaminated with toxic aromatic hydrocarbon pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Previous studies suggest that the mechanism of resistance to these and other dioxin-like compounds (DLCs) may involve reduced signaling through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) pathway. Here we investigated gene diversity and evidence for positive selection at three AHR-related loci (AHR1, AHR2, AHRR) in F. heteroclitus by comparing alleles from seven locations ranging over 600 km along the northeastern US, including extremely polluted and reference estuaries, with a focus on New Bedford Harbor (MA, USA), a PCB Superfund site, and nearby reference sites. Results: We identified 98 single nucleotide polymorphisms within three AHR-related loci among all populations, including synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions. Haplotype distributions were spatially segregated and F-statistics suggested strong population genetic structure at these loci, consistent with previous studies showing strong population genetic structure at other F. heteroclitus loci. Genetic diversity at these three loci was not significantly different in contaminated sites as compared to reference sites. However, for AHR2 the New Bedford Harbor population had significant FST values in comparison to the nearest reference populations. Tests for positive selection revealed ten nonsynonymous polymorphisms in AHR1 and four in AHR2. Four nonsynonymous SNPs in AHR1 and three in AHR2 showed large differences in base frequency between New Bedford Harbor and its reference site. Tests for isolation-by-distance revealed evidence for non-neutral change at the AHR2 locus. Conclusion: Together, these data suggest that F. heteroclitus populations in reference and polluted sites have similar genetic diversity, providing no evidence for strong genetic bottlenecks for populations in polluted locations. However, the data provide evidence for genetic differentiation among sites, selection at specific nucleotides in AHR1 and AHR2, and specific AHR2 SNPs and haplotypes that are associated with the PCB-resistant phenotype in the New Bedford Harbor population. The results suggest that AHRs, and especially AHR2, may be important, recurring targets for selection in local adaptation to dioxin-like aromatic hydrocarbon contaminants.",2014,"local adaptation; pollution; molecular mechanism; resistance; tolerance; convergent evolution; population genetics","Article","ISI"

The Northeast Arctic cod (NEAC) population in the Barents Sea undertakes annual spawning migrations to the northern Norwegian coast. Although spawning occurs sympatrically with the stationary Norwegian coastal cod (NCC), phenotypic and genetic differences between NEAC and NCC are maintained. In this study, we resolve the enigma by revealing the mechanisms underlying these differences. Extended linkage disequilibrium (LD) and population divergence were demonstrated in a 17.4-Mb region on linkage group 1 (LG1) based on genotypes of 494 SNPs from 192 parents of farmed families of NEAC, NCC or NEACxNCC crosses. Linkage analyses revealed two adjacent inversions within this region that repress meiotic recombination in NEACxNCC crosses. We identified a NEAC-specific haplotype consisting of 186 SNPs that was fixed in NEAC sampled from the Barents Sea, but segregating under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in eight NCC stocks. Comparative genomic analyses determine the NEAC configuration of the inversions to be the derived state and date it to similar to 1.62.0 Mya. The haplotype block harbours 763 genes, including candidates regulating swim bladder pressure, haem synthesis and skeletal muscle organization conferring adaptation to long-distance migrations and vertical movements down to large depths. Our results suggest that the migratory ecotype experiences strong directional selection for the two adjacent inversions on LG1. Despite interbreeding between NEAC and NCC, the inversions are maintaining genetic differentiation, and we hypothesize the co-occurrence of multiple adaptive alleles forming a 'supergene' in the NEAC population.",2016,"chromosomal inversion; gene flow; local adaptation; recombination; supergene; swim bladder","Article","ISI"
"Novel signals of adaptive genetic variation in northwestern Atlantic cod revealed by whole-genome sequencing","10.1111/eva.12861","Clucas, GV; Lou, RN; Therkildsen, NO; Kovach, AI","Selection can create complex patterns of adaptive differentiation among populations in the wild that may be relevant to management. Atlantic cod in the Northwest Atlantic are at a fraction of their historical abundance and a lack of recovery within the Gulf of Maine has created concern regarding the misalignment of fisheries management structures with biological population structure. To address this and investigate genome-wide patterns of variation, we used low-coverage sequencing to perform a region-wide, whole-genome analysis of fine-scale population structure. We sequenced 306 individuals from 20 sampling locations in U.S. and Canadian waters, including the major spawning aggregations in the Gulf of Maine in addition to spawning aggregations from Georges Bank, southern New England, the eastern Scotian Shelf, and St. Pierre Bank. With genotype likelihoods estimated at almost 11 million loci, we found large differences in haplotype frequencies of previously described chromosomal inversions between Canadian and U.S. sampling locations and also among U.S. sampling locations. Our whole-genome resolution also revealed novel outlier peaks, some of which showed significant genetic differentiation among sampling locations. Comparisons between allochronic winter- and spring-spawning populations revealed highly elevated relative (F-ST) and absolute (d(xy)) genetic differentiation near genes involved in reproduction, particularly genes associated with the brain-pituitary-gonadal axis, which likely control timing of spawning, contributing to prezygotic isolation. We also found genetic differentiation associated with heat shock proteins and other genes of functional relevance, with complex patterns that may point to multifaceted selection pressures and local adaptation among spawning populations. We provide a high-resolution picture of U.S. Atlantic cod population structure, revealing greater complexity than is currently recognized in management. Our genome-scan approach likely underestimates the full suite of adaptive differentiation among sampling locations. Nevertheless, it should inform the revision of stock boundaries to preserve adaptive genetic diversity and evolutionary potential of cod populations.",2019,"adaptive differentiation; allochronic reproduction; atlantic cod; chromosomal inversions; fisheries management; heat shock proteins; population genomics; whole-genome resequencing","Article","ISI"
"Breaking RAD: an evaluation of the utility of restriction site-associated DNA sequencing for genome scans of adaptation","10.1111/1755-0998.12635","Lowry, DB; Hoban, S; Kelley, JL; Lotterhos, KE; Reed, LK; Antolin, MF; Storfer, A","Understanding how and why populations evolve is of fundamental importance to molecular ecology. Restriction siteassociated DNA sequencing (RADseq), a popular reduced representation method, has ushered in a new era of genomescale research for assessing population structure, hybridization, demographic history, phylogeography and migration. RADseq has also been widely used to conduct genome scans to detect loci involved in adaptive divergence among natural populations. Here, we examine the capacity of those RADseq-based genome scan studies to detect loci involved in local adaptation. To understand what proportion of the genome is missed by RADseq studies, we developed a simple model using different numbers of RAD-tags, genome sizes and extents of linkage disequilibrium (length of haplotype blocks). Under the best-case modelling scenario, we found that RADseq using six-or eight-base pair cutting restriction enzymes would fail to sample many regions of the genome, especially for species with short linkage disequilibrium. We then surveyed recent studies that have used RADseq for genome scans and found that the median density of markers across these studies was 4.08 RAD-tag markers per megabase (one marker per 245 kb). The length of linkage disequilibrium for many species is one to three orders of magnitude less than density of the typical recent RADseq study. Thus, we conclude that genome scans based on RADseq data alone, while useful for studies of neutral genetic variation and genetic population structure, will likely miss many loci under selection in studies of local adaptation.",2017,"f-st; genome scan; genome-environment association; genotyping by sequencing; local adaptation; outlier analysis","Article","ISI"

Yet, to date very few comparative studies have been attempted within such radiations. Here, we characterize a new speciation continuum in a group of widespread Eurasian amphibians, the Pelobates spadefoot toads, by conducting multilocus (restriction site associated DNA sequencing and mitochondrial DNA) phylogenetic, phylogeographic and hybrid zone analyses. Within the P. syriacus complex, we discovered species-level cryptic divergences (>5 million years ago [My]) between populations distributed in the Near-East (hereafter P. syriacus sensu stricto [s.s.]) and southeastern Europe (hereafter P. balcanicus), each featuring deep intraspecific lineages. Altogether, we could scale hybridizability to divergence time along six different stages, spanning from sympatry without gene flow (P. fuscus and P. balcanicus, >10 My), parapatry with highly restricted hybridization (P. balcanicus and P. syriacus s.s., >5 My), narrow hybrid zones (~15 km) consistent with partial reproductive isolation (P. fuscus and P. vespertinus, ~3 My), to extensive admixture between Pleistocene and refugial lineages (<= 2 My). This full spectrum empirically supports a gradual build up of reproductive barriers through time, reversible up until a threshold that we estimate at ~3 My. Hence, cryptic phylogeographic lineages may fade away or become reproductively isolated species simply depending on the time they persist in allopatry, and without definite ecomorphological divergence.",2019,"amphibia; anuran; hybrid zones; population genomics; reproductive isolation; speciation continuum","Article","ISI"

Plasticity in heat tolerance, which includes acclimation or hardening, occurs when prior exposure to a warmer temperature changes an organism's upper thermal limit. The capacity for thermal acclimation could provide protection against warming, but prior work has found few generalizable patterns to explain variation in this trait. Here, we report the results of, to our knowledge, the first meta-analysis to examine within-species variation in thermal plasticity, using results from 20 studies (19 species) that quantified thermal acclimation capacities across 78 populations. We used meta-regression to evaluate two leading hypotheses. The climate variability hypothesis predicts that populations from more thermally variable habitats will have greater plasticity, while the trade-off hypothesis predicts that populations with the lowest heat tolerance will have the greatest plasticity. Our analysis indicates strong support for the trade-off hypothesis because populations with greater thermal tolerance had reduced plasticity. These results advance our understanding of variation in populations' susceptibility to climate change and imply that populations with the highest thermal tolerance may have limited phenotypic plasticity to adjust to ongoing climate warming.",2021,"thermal acclimation; phenotypic plasticity; heat tolerance; trade-off hypothesis; climate change; local adaptation","Article","ISI"

Responsiveness of fish host immunity to helminth antigens may therefore vary depending on the degree of host-parasite counter-adaptation. Generalist parasites, infective for a number of host species, might be unable to adapt optimally to the immune system of a certain host species, while specialist parasites might display high levels of adaptation to a particular host species. The degree of adaptations may further differ between sympatric and allopatric host-parasite combinations. Here, we test these hypotheses by in vitro exposure of head kidney leukocytes from three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) to antigens from parasites with a broad fish host range (Diplostomum pseudospathaceum, Triaenophorus nodulosus), a specific fish parasite of cyprinids (Ligula intestinalis) and parasites highly specific only to a single fish species as second intermediate host (Schistocephalus pungitii, which does not infect G. aculeatus, and Schistocephalus solidus, infecting G. aculeatus). In vitro responses of stickleback leukocytes to S. solidus antigens from six European populations, with S. solidus prevalence from <1% to 66% were tested in a fully crossed experimental design. Leukocyte cultures were analysed by means of flow cytomety and a chemiluminescence assay to quantify respiratory burst activity. We detected decreasing magnitudes of in vitro responses to antigens from generalist to specialist parasites and among specialists, from parasites that do not infect G. aculeatus to a G. aculeatus-infecting species. Generalist parasites seem to maintain their ability to infect different host species at the costs of relatively higher immunogenicity compared to specialist parasites. In a comparison of sympatric and allopatric combinations of stickleback leukocytes and antigens from S. solidus, magnitudes of in vitro responses were dependent on the prevalence of the parasite in the population of origin, rather than on sympatry. Antigens from Norwegian (prevalence 30-50%) and Spanish (40-66%) S. solidus induced generally higher in vitro responses compared to S. solidus from two German (<1%) populations. Likewise, leukocytes from stickleback populations with a high S. solidus prevalence showed higher in vitro responses to S. solidus antigens compared to populations with low S. solidus prevalence. This suggests a rather low degree of local adaptation in S. solidus populations, which might be due to high gene flow among populations because of their extremely mobile final hosts, fish-eating birds.

We used riverscape genetics modelling to assess whether climatic and habitat variables were related to neutral and adaptive patterns of genetic differentiation (population-specific and pairwise F-ST) within five metapopulations (79 populations, 4583 individuals) of steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in the Columbia River Basin, USA. Using 151 putatively neutral and 29 candidate adaptive SNP loci, we found that climate-related variables (winter precipitation, summer maximum temperature, winter highest 5% flow events and summer mean flow) best explained neutral and adaptive patterns of genetic differentiation within metapopulations, suggesting that climatic variation likely influences both demography (neutral variation) and local adaptation (adaptive variation). However, we did not observe consistent relationships between climate variables and F-ST across all metapopulations, underscoring the need for replication when extrapolating results from one scale to another (e.g. basin-wide to the metapopulation scale). Sensitivity analysis (leave-one-population-out) revealed consistent relationships between climate variables and F(ST)within three metapopulations; however, these patterns were not consistent in two metapopulations likely due to small sample sizes (N=10).

We defined informed criteria for the reintroduction of Beluga in Italian rivers by analysing its contemporary and ancient diversity based on a multi-markers approach. Location Ponto-Caspian and Adriatic basins. Methods We examined the distribution pattern of genetic diversity of the extant beluga populations by conducting genetic analysis on the mitochondrial dLoop and 27 nuclear microsatellites in 119 individuals from 3 geographical basins (Azov, Black and Caspian seas) and genomic analysis on 893 SNPs isolated through the 2bRAD approach in a subgroup of 92 samples. Mitochondrial information was also used to evaluate the variability of the extinct Adriatic population by analysing a few available museum samples. Results The historical Adriatic sample cannot be traced back to any of the contemporary ones laying to hypothesize the presence of a past isolated population. Instead, mitochondrial data did not reveal any geographically based clustering possibly reflecting the deep paleogeographical changes experienced by those areas. The genomic approach allowed us to depict for the first time a clear and supported genetic differentiation between two areas (the Black-Azov and the Caspian basins) but microsatellites also revealed a signal of differentiation of the Azov sample, possibly related to historical management activities in that area. Main conclusions The outcomes of the study revealed an unprecedented amount of information that can provide great benefits to the establishment of ex situ Beluga broodstocks and support any future translocations. The provided guidelines should be taken as a reference for the upcoming restoring of the Italian extinct Beluga population and also for any future management activity of this species in its entire distribution range.",2021,"conservation; genetic diversity; genomics; guidelines; ponto-caspian and adriatic regions; population genetics; reintroduction; risk of extinction; sturgeons","Article","ISI"

The population genetics of panmixia in these eel species has already been investigated. Our extensive population genetics analysis was based on 1400 Gb of whole-genome sequence (WGS) data from 84 eels. It demonstrated that a Japanese eel group from the Kuma River differed from other populations of the same species. Even after removing the potential adapted/selected single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data, and with very small differences (fixation index [Fst] = 0.01), we obtained results consistently indicating that panmixia does not occur in Japanese eels. The life cycle of the Japanese eel is well-established and the Kuma River is in the center of its habitat. Nevertheless, simple reproductive isolation is not the probable cause of non-panmixia in this species. We propose that the combination of spawning area subdivision, philopatry, and habitat preference/avoidance accounts for the non-panmixia in the Japanese eel population.

Climate change is affecting New Zealand through changes in precipitation patterns, increases in temperature, changes to the frequency and duration of droughts, sea level rise, and the increased occurrence of extreme events. These impacts highlight the vulnerability of key economic activities, communities, and infrastructure. As environmental and socioeconomic vulnerability varies with place, local level climate change policies are important tools to increase resilience when faced with a changing climate. The research survey, targeted towards local elected representatives, unpacks local scale climate change planning efforts across the country, as well as decision-maker perceptions of barriers and motivations in the area of climate change planning. Findings suggest that increasing local-scale responses hinges on public perception of the urgency of climate change, which is heavily influenced by national priorities. Furthermore, support for national level responses is limited by a collective view of climate change as an issue of an uncertain future, rather than one of present concern. Thus, the inclination to act at the local level is to some extent undermined by slow national action.",2018,"climate change; adaptation and mitigation; local scale planning; online survey; barriers; perceptions of climate change","Article","ISI"
"Using purposeful inbreeding to reduce outbreeding depression caused by escaped farmed Atlantic cod","10.3354/aei00082","Puckrin, OA; Purchase, CF; Trippel, EA","Fish often escape from aquaculture operations, raising concerns of interactions with wild individuals. Farmed fish from genetically diverse populations grown outside their native range create the threat of outbreeding depression if they escape and interbreed with wild fish. Atlantic cod Gadus morhua spawn within cages, releasing millions of embryos into the environment, some of which may live to reproduce. Due to selective breeding, fewer breeding individuals are used in culture relative to wild populations, potentially leading to inbreeding within single cages. If inbreeding reduces survival, this could reduce the likelihood of outbreeding depression if maturing escaped cod mate with wild cod. Forced inbreeding could be used to mitigate some effects of aquaculture on the environment. We aimed to determine if cod inbreed and, if so, what short-term effects inbreeding has on offspring. Spawned embryos from tanks of sister-brother-unrelated male trios underwent microsatellite analysis to determine parentage. Inbreeding occurred, and females did not prefer one type of male over the other. Percent hatch, deformities, larval size, and mortality were monitored in artificially fertilized inbred and unrelated crosses. Percent hatch was higher in non-inbred offspring, but inbreeding had no significant effect on the other factors.",2013,"gadus morhua; local adaptation; inbreeding; escape through spawning; embryo deformities; larval survival; microsatellite dna","Article","ISI"

It is frequently assumed that a species responds uniformly across its range to climate change. However, ecotypes - locally adapted populations within a species - display differences in traits that may affect their gross primary productivity (GPP) and response to climate change. To determine if ecotypes are important for understanding the response of ecosystem productivity to climate we measured and modeled growing season GPP in reciprocally transplanted and experimentally warmed ecotypes of the abundant Arctic sedge Eriophorum vaginatum. Transplanted northern ecotypes displayed home-site advantage in GPP that was associated with differences in leaf area index. Southern ecotypes exhibited a greater response in GPP when transplanted. The results demonstrate that ecotypic differentiation can impact the morphology and function of vegetation with implications for carbon cycling. Moreover they suggest that ecotypic control of GPP may limit the response of ecosystem productivity to climate change. This investigation shows that ecotypes play a substantial role in determining GPP and its response to climate. These results have implications for understanding annual to decadal carbon cycling where ecotypes could influence ecosystem function and vegetation feedbacks to climate change.",2019,"arctic tundra; carbon cycle; climate change; ecotypes; eriophorum vaginatum; gross primary productivity (gpp); local adaptation; reciprocal transplant","Article","ISI"

Despite growing research on urban climates, research at a scale that can support urban planning with scientificallyinformed strategies is still not as well documented for warm climate cities as for temperate cities. In response, this paper uses land surface temperature and geoinformation to assess the subtropical city of Taipei, Taiwan. Results show cooler environments are not only associated with natural surfaces, but also their inter-relation with different spatial arrangement of buildings. An open layout tends to have lower temperature at low- to mid-rise buildings, whereas a compact layout is the coolest form for high-rise buildings. Cooling benefit from open layouts is, however, related to an increase in greenery. Clustering distribution of greenspaces produces more notable cooling. Accordingly, this paper proposes four heat mitigation strategies for Taipei: 1) increasing the amount of water bodies and vegetation, with greater coverage and coherence; 2) taking building height and shadow into account during regeneration/development; 3) increasing spacing and greenery between low- to midrise buildings; and 4) avoiding construction of compact low-rise buildings with corrugated iron steel.",2020,"urban heat island effect; local climate zones; land surface temperature; urban planning; urban geometry; climate change adaptation","Article","ISI"
"Nutrient availability affects floral scent much less than other floral and vegetative traits in Lithophragma bolanderi","10.1093/aob/mcx069","Friberg, M; Waters, MT; Thompson, JN","Background and Aims Many plant-pollinator interactions are mediated by floral scents that can vary among species, among populations within species and even among individuals within populations. This variation could be innate and unaffected by the environment, but, because many floral volatiles have amino-acid precursors, scent variation also could be affected by differences in nutrient availability among environments. In plants that have coevolved with specific pollinators, natural selection is likely to favour low phenotypic plasticity in floral scent even under different conditions of nutrient availability if particular scents or scent combinations are important for attracting local pollinators. Methods Clonal pairs of multiple seed-families of two Lithophragma bolanderi (Saxifragaceae) populations were subjected to a high and a low nutrient treatment. These plants are pollinated primarily by host-specific Greya moths. It was evaluated how nutrient treatment affected variation in floral scent relative to other vegetative and reproductive traits. Key Results Floral scent strength (the per-flower emission rate) and composition were unaffected by nutrient treatment, but low-nutrient plants produced fewer and lighter leaves, fewer scapes and fewer flowers than highnutrient plants. The results held in both populations, which differed greatly in the number and composition of floral scents produced. Conclusions The results reveal a strong genetic component both to scent composition and emission level, and partly contrasts with the only previous study that has assessed the susceptibility of floral volatile signals to variation in the abundance of nutrients. These results, and the tight coevolutionary relationship between Lithophragma plants and their specialized Greya moth pollinators, indicate that reproductive traits important to coevolving interactions, such as the floral scent of L. bolanderi, may be locally specialized and more canalized than other traits important for plant fitness.",2017,"lithophragma bolanderi (saxifragaceae); floral scent; canalization; adaptation; coevolution; environmental effects; floral volatiles; nutrients; phenotypic plasticity; local specialization; 1,4-dimethoxybenzene","Article","ISI"

This approach has been especially useful for non-model organisms with limited genomic resources. Many building-loci pipelines have been developed to obtain robust single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) genotyping datasets using a de novo RAD-seq approach, i.e. without reference genomes. Here, the performances of two building-loci pipelines, STACKS 2 and Meyer's 2b-RAD v2.1 pipeline, were compared using a diverse set of aquatic species representing different genomic and/or population structure scenarios. Two bivalve species (Manila clam and common edible cockle) and three fish species (brown trout, silver catfish and small-spotted catshark) were studied. Four SNP panels were evaluated in each species to test both different building-loci pipelines and criteria for SNP selection. Furthermore, for Manila clam and brown trout, a reference genome approach was used as control.ResultsDespite different outcomes were observed between pipelines and species with the diverse SNP calling and filtering steps tested, no remarkable differences were found on genetic diversity and differentiation within species with the SNP panels obtained with a de novo approach. The main differences were found in brown trout between the de novo and reference genome approaches. Genotyped vs missing data mismatches were the main genotyping difference detected between the two building-loci pipelines or between the de novo and reference genome comparisons.ConclusionsTested building-loci pipelines for selection of SNP panels seem to have low influence on population genetics inference across the diverse case-study scenarios here studied.

Specialized anaerobic bacteria metabolize DCM; however, the genetic basis for this process has remained elusive. Comparative genomics of the three known anaerobic DCM-degrading bacterial species revealed a homologous gene cluster, designated the methylene chloride catabolism (mec) gene cassette, comprising 8–10 genes encoding proteins with 79.6%–99.7% amino acid identities. Functional annotation identified genes encoding a corrinoid-dependent methyltransferase system, and shotgun proteomics applied to two DCM-catabolizing cultures revealed high expression of proteins encoded on the mec gene cluster during anaerobic growth with DCM. In a DCM-contaminated groundwater plume, the abundance of mec genes strongly correlated with DCM concentrations (R2 = 0.71–0.85) indicating their potential value as process-specific bioremediation biomarkers. mec gene clusters were identified in metagenomes representing peat bogs, the deep subsurface, and marine ecosystems including oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), suggesting a capacity for DCM degradation in diverse habitats. The broad distribution of anaerobic DCM catabolic potential infers a role for DCM as an energy source in various environmental systems, and implies that the global DCM flux (i.e., the rate of formation minus the rate of consumption) might be greater than emission measurements suggest. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2022,"anaerobic degradation; bioremediation; climate change; dichloromethane flux; ozone destruction","Article","SCOPUS"

A challenge for larvae of coastal species is to return to coastal nursery habitats. Shore crab (Carcinus maenas L.) larvae are known to show tidal rhythmicity in vertical migration in tidal areas and circadian rhythmicity in microtidal areas, which seems to increase successful coastal settlement. We studied genome-wide differentiation based on 24,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms of 12 native populations of shore crab sampled from a large tidal amplitude gradient from macrotidal (~8 m) to microtidal (~0.2 m). Dispersal and recruitment success of larvae was assessed with a Lagrangian biophysical model, which showed a strong effect of larval behaviour on long-term connectivity, and dispersal barriers that partly coincided with different tidal environments. The genetic population structure showed a subdivision of the samples into three clusters, which represent micro-, meso- and macrotidal areas. The genetic differentiation was mostly driven by 0.5% outlier loci, which showed strong allelic clines located at the limits between the three tidal areas. Demographic modelling suggested that the two genetic barriers have different origins. Differential gene expression of two clock genes (cyc and pdp1) further highlighted phenotypic differences among genetic clusters that are potentially linked to the differences in larval behaviour. Taken together, our seascape genomic study suggests that tidal regime acts as a strong selection force on shore crab population structure, consistent with larval behaviour affecting dispersal and recruitment success. © 2022 The Authors.

"Genome size dynamics in marine ribbon worms (Nemertea, spiralia)","10.3390/GENES12091347","Paule J., von Döhren J., Sagorny C., Nilsson M.A.","Nemertea is a phylum consisting of 1300 mostly marine species. Nemertea is distinguished by an eversible muscular proboscis, and most of the species are venomous. Genomic resources for this phylum are scarce despite their value in understanding biodiversity. Here, we present genome size estimates of Nemertea based on flow cytometry and their relationship to different morphological and developmental traits. Ancestral genome size estimations were done across the nemertean phylogeny. The results increase the available genome size estimates for Nemertea three-fold. Our analyses show that Nemertea has a narrow genome size range (0.43–3.89 pg) compared to other phyla in Lophotrochozoa. A relationship between genome size and evolutionary rate, developmental modes, and habitat was found. Trait analyses show that the highest evolutionary rate of genome size is found in upper intertidal, viviparous species with direct development.

"Phylogeographic pattern of marine fauna in the Indo-West Pacific [印度洋-西太平洋海洋动物谱系地理演化格局]","10.11693/hyhz20200900260","He L.-J., Ren H.-M., Xu S.-S., Zhang J.","The globally highest primary productivity and fishery production have been observed in the Indo-West Pacific due to many wide continental shelves, islands, and marginal seas over there. Especially, as the centers of biodiversity terrestrial materials input and the energy fluxes between the two oceans, the East Indies Triangle played an important role in spatial distribution and evolution of global marine species. By linking physical and chemical oceanographic conditions, we summarized the phylogeographic patterns of regional marine fauna in the Indo-West Pacific based on mitochondrial and nuclear genomics. (1) In coastal China seas, the Leizhou Peninsula-Hainan Island, glacial exposed Taiwan Strait, Changjiang (Yangtze) River Plume, and old Huanghe (Yellow) River estuary acted as physical barriers and biogeographic boundaries to limit marine organisms' migration among seas. In general, widespread marine species from the South China Sea, East China Sea, Yellow Sea, and Bohai Sea possess a single star-like clade suggesting recent population expansion, and some endemic species in the South China Sea are composed of multiple divergent clades indicating genetic equilibrium population. Furthermore, regional populations showed different population dynamic histories related to different oceanographic conditions between the South China Sea and East China Sea. (2) Along the route of the Kuroshio flowing in the Northwest Pacific Ocean, the main axis and branches of Kuroshio could have acted as biogeographical barriers to limit gene flow of coastal species among mainland China, Ryukyu Islands, main Japanese Islands, and Korean Peninsula. (3) The two clades separated by the Wallace's Line, Huxley's Line, and Indian Ocean-Pacific Ocean's Line were usually observed in marine and anadromous saltwater species from the East Indies Triangle. (4) An across-equatorial gene flow perpendicular to present ocean surface currents was observed in different marine species between the northwest Pacific and southwest Pacific due to north-flowing subsurface current and seasonal reversal of coastal surface current. (5) Some species shared by the East Indian Ocean and West Indian Ocean originated generally from the East Indian Ocean and migrated to West Indian Ocean through transoceanic dispersal carried by the west flowing South Equatorial Current. (6) Two different patterns of genetic structure, viz. genetic homogeneous (stochasticly mixed) population and deeply divergent populations/lineages were often observed in different species from the West Indian Ocean. (7) Bidirectional gene flow could be responsible for shared marine species between the South China Sea and northeastern Indian Ocean. (8) Some evolutional signals of ancient geologic events, palaeo-oceanographic conditions and climatic events can be implicated by phylogeographic histories of different marine species due to co-evolution among them. © 2021, Science Press.

"Climate differently influences the genomic patterns of two sympatric marine fish species","10.1111/1365-2656.13623","Boulanger E., Benestan L., Guerin P.-E., Dalongeville A., Mouillot D., Manel S.","Climate influences population genetic variation in marine species. Capturing these impacts remains challenging for marine fishes which disperse over large geographical scales spanning steep environmental gradients. It requires the extensive spatial sampling of individuals or populations, representative of seascape heterogeneity, combined with a set of highly informative molecular markers capable of revealing climatic-associated genetic variations. We explored how space, dispersal and environment shape the genomic patterns of two sympatric fish species in the Mediterranean Sea, which ranks among the oceanic basins most affected by climate change and human pressure. We hypothesized that the population structure and climate-associated genomic signatures of selection would be stronger in the less mobile species, as restricted gene flow tends to facilitate the fixation of locally adapted alleles. To test our hypothesis, we genotyped two species with contrasting dispersal abilities: the white seabream Diplodus sargus and the striped red mullet Mullus surmuletus. We collected 823 individuals and used genotyping by sequencing (GBS) to detect 8,206 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for the seabream and 2,794 for the mullet. For each species, we identified highly differentiated genomic regions (i.e. outliers) and disentangled the relative contribution of space, dispersal and environmental variables (climate, marine primary productivity) on the outliers' genetic structure to test the prevalence of gene flow and local adaptation. We observed contrasting patterns of gene flow and adaptive genetic variation between the two species. The seabream showed a distinct Alboran sea population and panmixia across the Mediterranean Sea. The mullet revealed additional differentiation within the Mediterranean Sea that was significantly correlated to summer and winter temperatures, as well as marine primary productivity. Functional annotation of the climate-associated outlier SNPs then identified candidate genes involved in heat tolerance that could be examined to further predict species' responses to climate change. Our results illustrate the key steps of a comparative seascape genomics study aiming to unravel the evolutionary processes at play in marine species, to better anticipate their response to climate change. Defining population adaptation capacities and environmental niches can then serve to incorporate evolutionary processes into species conservation planning. © 2021 British Ecological Society",2021,"climate change; comparative seascape genomics; gene flow; local adaptation; mediterranean sea","Article","SCOPUS"

Zostera marina (eelgrass) plays a crucial role in the functioning of coastal marine ecosystems and global carbon sequestration. It is the most widely studied seagrass and has become a marine model system for exploring adaptation under rapid climate change. The original draft genome (v.1.0) of the seagrass Z. marina (L.) was based on a combination of Illumina mate-pair libraries and fosmid-ends. A total of 25.55 Gb of Illumina and 0.14 Gb of Sanger sequence was obtained representing 47.7× genomic coverage. The assembly resulted in ~2000 unordered scaffolds (L50 of 486 Kb), a final genome assembly size of 203MB, 20,450 protein coding genes and 63% TE content. Here, we present an upgraded chromosome-scale genome assembly and compare v.1.0 and the new v.3.1, reconfirming previous results from Olsen et al. (2016), as well as pointing out new findings. Methods: The same high molecular weight DNA used in the original sequencing of the Finnish clone was used. A high-quality reference genome was assembled with the MECAT assembly pipeline combining PacBio long-read sequencing and Hi-C scaffolding. Results: In total, 75.97 Gb PacBio data was produced. The final assembly comprises six pseudo-chromosomes and 304 unanchored scaffolds with a total length of 260.5Mb and an N50 of 34.6 MB, showing high contiguity and few gaps (~0.5%). 21,483 protein-encoding genes are annotated in this assembly, of which 20,665 (96.2%) obtained at least one functional assignment based on similarity to known proteins. Conclusions: As an important marine angiosperm, the improved Z. marina genome assembly will further assist evolutionary, ecological, and comparative genomics at the chromosome level. The new genome assembly will further our understanding into the structural and physiological adaptations from land to marine life. © 2021 Ma X et al.",2021,"annotation; chromosome-scale genome assembly; eelgrass; seagrass; zostera marina","Article","SCOPUS"

In corals, tissue concentrations of GB are substantially higher than in the ambient seawater. However, the synthetic routes remain unresolved, questioning whether intracellular GB originates from de novo synthesis or heterotrophic input. Here we show that the genomic blueprint of coral metaorganisms encode the biosynthetic and degradation machinery for GB. Member organisms also adopted the prokaryotic high-affinity carrier-mediated uptake of exogenous GB, rendering coral reefs potential sinks of marine dissolved GB. The machinery metabolizing GB is highly expressed in the coral model Aiptasia and its microalgal symbionts, signifying GB's role in the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis. We estimate that corals store between 106–109 grams of GB globally, representing about 16% of their nitrogen biomass.

They also allow for more accurate predictions of how future environmental change might affect marine species. The Persian/Arabian Gulf is extreme in both temperature and salinity, whereas the adjacent Gulf of Oman has conditions more typical of tropical oceans. The sea urchin Echinometra sp. EZ inhabits both of these seas and plays a critical role in coral reef health as a grazer and bioeroder, but, to date, there have been no population genomic studies on this or any urchin species in this unique region. E sp. EZ's life history traits (e.g., large population sizes, large reproductive clutches, and long life spans), in theory, should homogenize populations unless nonneutral processes are occurring. Here, we generated a draft genome and a restriction site-associated DNA sequencing data set from seven populations along an environmental gradient across the Persian/ Arabian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. The estimated genome size of E. sp. EZ was 609 Mb and the heterozygosity was among the highest recorded for an echinoderm at 4.5%. We recovered 918 high-quality SNPs from 85 individuals which we then used in downstream analyses. Population structure analyses revealed a high degree of admixture between all sites, although there was population differentiation and significant pairwise FST values between the two seas. Preliminary results suggest migration is bidirectional between the seas and nine candidate loci were identified as being under putative natural selection, including one collagen gene.

Its distribution, abundance, and amenability to developmental perturbation make it a popular model for ecologists and developmental biologists. Here, we present a chromosomal-level genome assembly of L. variegatus generated from a combination of PacBio long reads, 10× Genomics sequencing, and HiC chromatin interaction sequencing. We show L. variegatus has 19 chromosomes with an assembly size of 870.4 Mb. The contiguity and completeness of this assembly are reflected by a scaffold length N50 of 45.5 Mb and BUSCO completeness score of 95.5%. Ab initio and transcript-informed gene modeling and annotation identified 27,232 genes with an average gene length of 12.6 kb, comprising an estimated 39.5% of the genome. Repetitive regions, on the other hand, make up 45.4% of the genome. Physical mapping of well-studied developmental genes onto each chromosome reveals nonrandom spatial distribution of distinct genes and gene families, which provides insight into how certain gene families may have evolved and are transcriptionally regulated in this species. Lastly, aligning RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data onto this assembly demonstrates the value of highly contiguous, complete genome assemblies for functional genomics analyses that is unattainable with fragmented, incomplete assemblies.

In comparison with synthetic drugs, they have abounding beneficial effects in bestowing protection against many diseases, including cancer. Cancer has been observed as a major threat in recent decades, and its prevalence is expected to increase over the next decades. Also, current treatment methods in cancer therapy such as radiation therapy and chemotherapy cause severe adverse side effects among the cancer population. Therefore, it is exigent to find a remedy without any side effects. Methods: In recent years, research has focused on obtaining naturally derived products to encounter this complication. The current pace of investigations, such as gene identification and advancement in combinatorial chemistry, leads to the aberrant access to a wide range of new synthetic drugs. In fact, natural products act as templates in structure predictions and synthesis of new compounds with enhanced biological activities. Results: Recent developments in genomics have established the importance of polymorphism, which implies that patients require different drugs for their treatment. This demands the discovery of a large number of drugs, but limited sources restrict the pharmaceutical industry to overcome these major obstacles. The use of natural products and their semisynthetic and synthetic analogues could alleviate these problems. However, the lack of standardization in terms of developing methods for evaluating the chemical composition, efficacy, isolation and international approval is still a major limitation in this field. In the past few years, several drug-approval authorities, including the FDA and WHO have allowed using these naturally derived compounds in humans. Conclusion: In this review, we described the use of some natural products from plant and marine sources in cancer treatment and shed some light on semi-synthetic and synthetic compounds derived from natural sources used in cancer therapy. © 2020, Bentham Science Publishers.

"Marine metabolomics: A method for nontargeted measurement of metabolites in seawater by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry","10.1128/mSystems.00638-19","Sogin E.M., Puskás E., Dubilier N., Liebeke M.","Microbial communities exchange molecules with their environment, which plays a major role in regulating global biogeochemical cycles and climate. While extracellular metabolites are commonly measured in terrestrial and limnic ecosystems, the presence of salt in marine habitats limits the nontargeted analyses of the ocean exometabolome using mass spectrometry (MS). Current methods require salt removal prior to sample measurements, which can alter the molecular composition of the metabolome and limit the types of compounds detected by MS. To overcome these limitations, we developed a gas chromatography MS (GC-MS) method that avoids sample altering during salt removal and that detects metabolites down to nanomolar concentrations from less than 1 ml of seawater. We applied our method (SeaMet) to explore marine metabolomes in vitro and in vivo. First, we measured the production and consumption of metabolites during the culture of a heterotrophic bacterium, Marinobacter adhaerens. Our approach revealed successional uptake of amino acids, while sugars were not consumed. These results show that exocellular metabolomics provides insights into nutrient uptake and energy conservation in marine microorganisms. We also applied SeaMet to explore the in situ metabolome of coral reef and mangrove sediment porewaters. Despite the fact that these ecosystems occur in nutrient-poor waters, we uncovered high concentrations of sugars and fatty acids, compounds predicted to play a key role for the abundant and diverse microbial communities in coral reef and mangrove sediments. Our data demonstrate that SeaMet advances marine metabolomics by enabling a nontargeted and quantitative analysis of marine metabolites, thus providing new insights into nutrient cycles in the oceans. IMPORTANCE Nontargeted approaches using metabolomics to analyze metabolites that occur in the oceans is less developed than those for terrestrial and limnic ecosystems. One of the challenges in marine metabolomics is that salt limits metabolite analysis in seawater to methods requiring salt removal. Building on previous sample preparation methods for metabolomics, we developed SeaMet, which overcomes the limitations of salt on metabolite detection. Considering that the oceans contain the largest dissolved organic matter pool on Earth, describing the marine metabolome using nontargeted approaches is critical for understanding the drivers behind element cycles, biotic interactions, ecosystem function, and atmospheric CO2 storage. Our method complements both targeted marine metabolomic investigations as well as other “omics” (e.g., genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics) approaches by providing an avenue for studying the chemical interaction between marine microbes and their habitats. © 2019 Sogin et al.",2019,"exometabolomics; marine; metabolomics; microbial ecology","Article","SCOPUS"

Access to marine genetic resources (MGR) for the biodiversity research community is essential to allow these environments to be better characterised. Negotiations have commenced under the auspices of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to develop a new treaty to further the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in ABNJ. It is timely to consider the relevant issues with the development of the treaty underway. Currently uncertainties surround the legal definition of MGR and scope of related benefit-sharing, against a background of regional and global governance gaps in ABNJ. These complications are mirrored in science, with recent major advances in the field of genomics, but variability in handling of the resulting increasing volumes of data. Here, we attempt to define the concept of MGR from a scientific perspective, review current practices for the generation of and access to MGR from ABNJ in the context of relevant regulations, and illustrate the utility of best-practice with a case study. We contribute recommendations with a view to strengthen best-practice in accessibility of MGR, including: funder recognition of the central importance of taxonomy/biodiversity research; support of museums/collections for long-term sample curation; open access to data; usage and further development of globally recognised data standards and platforms; publishing of datasets via open-access, quality controlled and standardised data systems and open access journals; commitment to best-practice workflows; a global registry of cruises; and lastly development of a clearing house to further centralised access to the above.

Furthermore, all vopT+ isolates were tdh+ isolates, and none of them coexist with trh+ isolates.

"Rhodopsin gene copies in Japanese eel originated in a teleost-specific genome duplication","10.1186/s40851-017-0079-2","Nakamura Y., Yasuike M., Mekuchi M., Iwasaki Y., Ojima N., Fujiwara A., Chow S., Saitoh K.","Background Gene duplication is considered important to increasing the genetic diversity in animals. In fish, visual pigment genes are often independently duplicated, and the evolutionary significance of such duplications has long been of interest. Eels have two rhodopsin genes (rho), one of which (freshwater type, fw-rho) functions in freshwater and the other (deep-sea type, ds-rho) in marine environments. Hence, switching of rho expression in retinal cells is tightly linked with eels' unique life cycle, in which they migrate from rivers or lakes to the sea. These rho genes are apparently paralogous, but the timing of their duplication is unclear due to the deep-branching phylogeny. The aim of the present study is to elucidate the evolutionary origin of the two rho copies in eels using comparative genomics methods. Results In the present study, we sequenced the genome of Japanese eel Anguilla japonica and reconstructed two regions containing rho by de novo assembly. We found a single corresponding region in a non-teleostean primitive ray-finned fish (spotted gar) and two regions in a primitive teleost (Asian arowana). The order of ds-rho and the neighboring genes was highly conserved among the three species. With respect to fw-rho, which was lost in Asian arowana, the neighboring genes were also syntenic between Japanese eel and Asian arowana. In particular, the pattern of gene losses in ds-rho and fw-rho regions was the same as that in Asian arowana, and no discrepancy was found in any of the teleost genomes examined. Phylogenetic analysis supports mutual monophyly of these two teleostean synteny groups, which correspond to the ds-rho and fw-rho regions. Conclusions Syntenic and phylogenetic analyses suggest that the duplication of rhodopsin gene in Japanese eel predated the divergence of eel (Elopomorpha) and arowana (Osteoglossomorpha). Thus, based on the principle of parsimony, it is most likely that the rhodopsin paralogs were generated through a whole genome duplication in the ancestor of teleosts, and have remained till the present in eels with distinct functional roles. Our result indicates, for the first time, that teleost-specific genome duplication may have contributed to a gene innovation involved in eel-specific migratory life cycle. © 2017, The Author(s).",2017,"anguilla; gene loss; phylogenomics; rhodopsin paralogs; synteny; teleostei; visual adaptation; whole genome duplication","Article","SCOPUS"
"Optimization of high-throughput sequencing primers for nanophytoplankton and picophytoplankton in environmental samples","10.5846/stxb201605180963","Liu W.D., Song L., Wu J.","In this study, nanophytoplankton and picophytoplankton diversity in seawater samples was analyzed using a high-throughput sequencing platform and a series of bioinformatics tools, based on the V4 and V9 region of 18S rDNA as the target gene. High-throughput sequencing, which is considered as one of the most important tools in genomics research, is widely applied in the field of marine nanophytoplankton and picophytoplankton diversity studies. We successfully obtained a pair of nanophytoplankton and picophytoplankton PCR primers V4(F/R) by analyzing the nucleic acid database and using a series of bioinformatics tools. Two pairs of universal primers were also selected for comparative analysis, which amplified variable region V4 and V9 of the small subunit nuclear ribosomal DNA (SSU nrDNA).The sensitivity and specificity of PCR primers V4(F/R), V9(F/R), and C4(F/R) were also evaluated and compared using online bioinformatics software. The results showed that the amplification specificity of primer pair V4(F/R) was better than that of V9(F/R) and C4(F/R) in eukaryotic algae. High-throughput sequencing results showed that 68834 raw tags were amplified by the primers, 99% of which were effective tags. Sequences of more than 94% of the effective tags were identified by Ribosomal Database Project Classifier, among which 308 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of one sample were used for further analysis. The average numbers of nanophytoplankton and picophytoplankton OTUs amplified by V4(F/R), V9(F/R), and C4(F/R), were 78, 42, 58, respectively. The primer pair V4(F/R) was found to have higher sensitivity and specificity for amplifying nanophytoplankton and picophytoplankton, including Micromonas pusilla, Ostreococcus tauri, Pycnococcus provasolii, Aureococcus anophagefferens, and Heterosigma akashiwo. The V4 region from the environmental eukaryotic 18S rDNA gene could be suitable for high-throughput sequencing technology, and it was also a good target gene formarine nanophytoplankton and picophytoplankton identification. This study demonstrates the use of a simple, rapid, high sensitivity, and low-cost technology to explore marine nanophytoplankton and picophytoplankton diversity.

"The role of genetics in fisheries management under the E.U. common fisheries policy","10.1111/jfb.13151","Casey J., Jardim E., Martinsohn J.T.H.","Exploitation of fish and shellfish stocks by the European Union fishing fleet is managed under the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), which aims to ensure that fishing and aquaculture are environmentally, economically and socially sustainable and that they provide a source of healthy food for E.U. citizens. A notable feature of the CFP is its legally enshrined requirement for sound scientific advice to underpin its objectives. The CFP was first conceived in 1970 when it formed part of the Common Agricultural Policy. Its formal inception as a stand-alone regulation occurred in 1983 and since that time, the CFP has undergone reforms in 1992, 2002 and 2013, each time bringing additional challenges to the scientific advisory process as the scope of the advice increased in response to changing objectives arising from E.U. regulations and commitments to international agreements. This paper reviews the influence that genetics has had on fish stock assessments and the provision of management advice for European fisheries under successive reforms of the CFP. The developments in genetics since the inception of the CFP have given rise to a diverse and versatile set of genetic techniques that have the potential to provide significant added value to fisheries assessments and the scientific advisory process. While in some cases, notably Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp., genetics appear to be very well integrated into existing management schemes, it seems that for marine fishes, discussions on the use of genetics and genomics for fisheries management are often driven by the remarkable technological progress in this field, rather than imminent needs emerging from policy frameworks. An example is the recent suggestion to use environmental (e)DNA for monitoring purposes. While there is no denying that state-of-the-art genetic and genomic approaches can and will be of value to address a number of issues relevant for the management and conservation of marine renewable natural resources, a focus on technology rather than policy and management needs is prone to widen the gap between science and policy, governance and management, thereby further impeding the effective integration of genetic and genomic information into the fisheries management decision making process. Hence, rather than focusing on what is technically achievable, this review outlines suggestions as to which modern genetic and genomic approaches are likely to help address some of the most pressing fisheries management challenges under the CFP. © 2016 The Authors.

Though discovered over a decade ago [2, 3], their potential importance was unrecognized, and our knowledge remains restricted to a single gene amplified from environmental DNA, the 18S rRNA gene (small subunit [SSU]). Here, we use single-cell genomics (SCG) and microscopy to characterize ten marine diplonemids, isolated from a range of depths in the eastern North Pacific Ocean. Phylogenetic analysis confirms that the isolates reflect the entire range of marine diplonemid diversity, and comparisons to environmental SSU surveys show that sequences from the isolates range from rare to superabundant, including the single most common marine diplonemid known. SCG generated a total of ∼915 Mbp of assembled sequence across all ten cells and ∼4,000 protein-coding genes with homologs in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) orthology database, distributed across categories expected for heterotrophic protists. Models of highly conserved genes indicate a high density of non-canonical introns, lacking conventional GT-AG splice sites. Mapping metagenomic datasets [4] to SCG assemblies reveals virtually no overlap, suggesting that nuclear genomic diversity is too great for representative SCG data to provide meaningful phylogenetic context to metagenomic datasets. This work provides an entry point to the future identification, isolation, and cultivation of these elusive yet ecologically important cells. The high density of nonconventional introns, however, also portends difficulty in generating accurate gene models and highlights the need for the establishment of stable cultures and transcriptomic analyses. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",2016,"diplonemid; ecology; evolution; heterotroph; marine microbiology; protist","Article","SCOPUS"

"Advances in ecometabolomics","10.5846/stxb201401080064","Zhao D., Liu P.F., Pan C., Du R.P., Ge J.P.","Metabolomics is the qualitative and quantitative study of the whole metabolome within a biological system. Metabolomics attempts to systematically integrate metabolic processes using data accumulated from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS). NMR exploits the absorption and re-emission of electromagnetic radiation by nuclei exposed to a magnetic field. Additionally, NMR reveals the specific quantum mechanical magnetic properties of the atomic nucleus. MS is an analytical technique that provides spectra of the masses of the atoms or molecules comprising a sample. From these spectra, researchers can determine the elemental or isotopic signature of a sample, the masses of its constituent particles and molecules, and the chemical structures of molecules such as peptides. NMR and MS are among the most widely used technical platforms in metabolomics research, enabling the acquisition of detailed and systematic information of the biological systems under study. Currently, metabolomics has become an effective tool in researching traditional ecologies such as soil and marine ecology. At present, metabolomics is increasingly connecting with other systematic ‘omics’ fields such as proteomics and genomics. The fusion of ecology with metabolomics and the merging of metabolomics with other relevant techniques promise the establishment and development of a new ‘omics’ field—ecological metabolomics, or ecometabolomics. Ecometabolomics primarily aims to identify the global metabolomic response of an organism to environmental changes, and thereby enhance our understanding of how different species interact and co-evolve. Increasingly, ecologists are recognizing the importance of understanding how the metabolome and total number of metabolites respond to environmental changes. In four sections, this paper discusses recent applications of metabolomics techniques in ecological studies. The first section introduces the concepts of metabolomics and ecometabolomics and outlines their developmental history. The second section focuses on the widely used NMR and MS techniques. NMR includes1H NMR,13C NMR,31P NMR,17O NMR and15N NMR, whereas MS techniques include gas chromatogram-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), liquid chromatogram-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and directed infusion or injection mass spectrometry (DIMS). In the third section, the application status of metabolomics techniques in ecological research is discussed from two perspectives. At the biological tissue level, metabolomics has been applied to individual, population, and community ecologies. At the organism level, it has been adopted for species-level identification in animal ecology, plant ecology and microbial ecology. The forth section discusses the future challenges and perspectives of ecometabolomics. First, metabolomics will become more comprehensively integrated with other systematic biological techniques. Second, multiple analytical methods and techniques adopted in metabolomics will be simultaneously applied to single biological samples, enabling the synchronous accumulation of qualitative and quantitative data within a very short time. Third, a metabolomics database will be compiled and expanded to facilitate scientific research and to increase the analytical efficiency of both bioinformatics and metabolomics. The paper also suggests the roles for future ecologists. In conclusion, techniques relevant to metabolomics will be widely and intensively applied in ecological research such as pressure response, life cycle variation, population structure, interaction and circulation of nutrients, and ecological niches. © 2015 Ecological Society of China.

Two types of observations from environmental samples — direct counts of viral particles and viral metagenomic sequences — have been critical to these discoveries. Accurate direct counts have established ecosystem-scale trends in the impacts of viral infection on microbial host populations and have shown that viral communities within aquatic and soil environments respond to both short term and seasonal environmental change. Direct counts have been critical for estimating viral production rate, a measurement essential to quantifying the implications of viral infection for the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients within ecosystems. While direct counts have defined the magnitude of viral processes; shotgun sequences of environmental viral DNA — virome sequences — have enabled researchers to estimate the diversity and composition of natural viral communities. Virome-enabled studies have found the virioplankton to contain thousands of viral genotypes in communities where the most dominant viral population accounts for a small fraction of total abundance followed by a long tail of diverse populations. Detailed examination of long virome sequences has led to new understanding of genotype-to-phenotype connections within marine viruses and revealed that viruses carry metabolic genes that are important to maintaining cellular energy during viral replication. Increased access to long virome sequences will undoubtedly reveal more genetic secrets of viruses and enable us to build a genomics rulebook for predicting key biological and ecological features of unknown viruses. © 2015, The Microbiological Society of Korea and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",2015,"informational proteins; viral ecology; viromics","Article","SCOPUS"

Algal biomass supply of sufficient quality and quantity however remains a concern with increasing environmental pressures conflicting with the growing demand. Recent attempts in supplying consistent, safe and environmentally acceptable biomass through cultivation of (macro- and micro-) algal biomass have concentrated on characterizing natural variability in bioactives, and optimizing cultivated materials through strain selection and hybridization, as well as breeding and, more recently, genetic improvements of biomass. Biotechnological tools including metabolomics, transcriptomics, and genomics have recently been extended to algae but, in comparison to microbial or plant biomass, still remain underdeveloped. Current progress in algal biotechnology is driven by an increased demand for new sources of biomass due to several global challenges, new discoveries and technologies available as well as an increased global awareness of the many applications of algae.

A number of marine species, through their adhesive properties, also represent significant foulers that become increasingly problematic to aquaculture, shipping or local biodiversity. In order to develop more sophisticated man-made glues and/or efficient fouling resistant surfaces, it is important to understand the mechanical, structural andmolecular properties of adhesive organs in selected species. Ascidians are marine invertebrates with larvae that opportunistically attach to almost any type of submerged surface to undergo metamorphosis into permanently sessile adults. Not only do they represent a globally important fouling organism, but they are becoming increasingly popular as model organisms for developmental biology. The latter is due to their phylogenetic position as the sister group to the vertebrates and their cellular and molecular accessibility for experimentation.

Here we report the RNA sequencing of the mussel digestive gland, performed with the aim: a) to produce a high quality de novo transcriptome assembly, thus improving the genetic and molecular knowledge of this organism b) to provide an initial assessment of the response to paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) on a molecular level, in order to identify possible molecular markers of toxin accumulation. Results: The comprehensive de novo assembly and annotation of the transcriptome yielded a collection of 12,079 non-redundant consensus sequences with an average length of 958 bp, with a high percentage of full-length transcripts. The whole-transcriptome gene expression study indicated that the accumulation of paralytic toxins produced by the dinoflagellate Alexandrium minutum over a time span of 5 days scarcely affected gene expression, but the results need further validation with a greater number of biological samples and naturally contaminated specimens. Conclusion: The digestive gland reference transcriptome we produced significantly improves the data collected from previous sequencing efforts and provides a basic resource for expanding functional genomics investigations in M. galloprovincialis.

Therefore, the F type of freshwater mussels exist two gene orders between CO II and 12S rRNA: one is CO II-ND3-H-A-S1-S2-E-ND2-M-W-R-rrnS, another is CO II-H-S1-ND2-M-ND3-A-S2-E-W-R-rrnS. The difference is caused by rearrangement of 8 genes, including ND3, tRNAHis, tRNAAla, tRNASer1, tRNASer2, tRNAGlu, ND2 and tRNAMet. (iv) 13 protein genes contain 4 initiation codons which are I (AUU, AUC), V (GUG), M(AUA), L(UUG) and the stop codons of UAA or UAG with the exception of ND4 with incomplete T. (v) Analysis show that most of 22 tRNAs have typical cloverleaf structures, the acceptor of tRNALys and tRNAThr have bulge loop for T and A base unpairing, the anticodon loop of tRNAS2 has 9 bases. 5 kinds of base unpairing are showed in the secondary structure of tRNA, such as A-C, A-A, G-T, T-T and T-C, in acceptor, D-loop and TψC loop. (vi) 27 noncoding regions exist in L. leai, ranging in size from 1 to 969 bp. 4 largest noncoding regions are found between ND5-tRNAGln (969bp), tRNAGlu -tRNATrp (288 bp), ND3-tRNATrp (116 bp), and tRNAHis -tRNASer (114 bp), only the 116 bp noncoding regions has an high A+T content (A+T = 74. 14%). (vii) Phylogenetic trees show that L. leai is clustered together with other freshwater mussels and far away from marine bivalves. The results of this study provide basic information for genetic resources and rule of DUI transmission of mtDNA in freshwater mussel, also provide the basis and model for gene rearrangement of mitochondrial genome in bivalves.",2012,"f type of mitochondrial genome; gene rearrangement; lamprotula leai; sequence analysis","Article","SCOPUS"

This cycle is driven by complex biogeochemical transformations, including nitrogen fixation, denitrification, and assimilation and anaerobic ammonia oxidation, mediated by microorganisms. New processes and organisms continue to be discovered, complicating the already complex picture of oceanic N cycling. Genomics research has uncovered the diversity of nitrogen metabolism strategies in phytoplankton and bacterioplankton. The elemental ratios of nutrients in biological material are more flexible than previously believed, with implications for vertical export of carbon and associated nutrients to the deep ocean. Estimates of nitrogen fixation and denitrification continue to be modified, and anaerobic ammonia oxidation has been identified as a new process involved in denitrification in oxygen minimum zones.

We dissected here the contribution of both processes to increased tolerance in Chironomus riparius to cadmium (Cd) exposure in a multi-generation experiment and inferred the underlying genomic basis. We simulated environmentally realistic conditions by continuously increasing contaminant concentration in six replicates initiated with 1000 larvae each, three pre-exposed to Cd and three not exposed to Cd (no-Cd) over eight generations. We measured life-cycle traits, transcriptomic responses and genome-wide allele frequency changes from this evolve and resequencing (E&R) experiment. Overall, life cycle tests revealed little phenotypic adaptation to Cd exposure, but a slightly increase in survival in the first larval stage was observed. Population genomic analyses showed a strong genome-wide selective response in all replicates, highlighting two main biological functions involved in development and growth of the chironomids. Emphasizing that laboratory conditions continually exert selective pressure. However, the integration of the transcriptomic to the genomic data allowed to distinguish pathways specifically selected by the Cd exposure related to microtubules and organelles and cellular movement. Those pathways could be functionally related to an excretion of metals. Thus, our results indicate that genetic adaptation to Cd in C. riparius can happen within few generations under an environmentally relevant exposure scenario, but substantial phenotypic tolerance might take more time to arise. With our approach, we introduce an experimental setup to fill the existing gap in evolutionary ecotoxicology to investigate these early signs of genetic adaptation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022,"adaptation; chironomids; genomics; toxic metal; whole genome sequencing","Article","SCOPUS"

From an evolutionary ecological perspective, they allow teasing apart the relative contributions of plasticity and evolutionary divergence in driving rapid phenotypic diversification. When IAS spread across extensive geographic ranges, climatic variation may represent a source of strong natural selection through overwinter mortality and summer heat stress. This could favour local adaptation, i.e., evolutionary divergence of certain traits. IAS, however, are likely to show plasticity in survival-related traits, and environmental fluctuation in their new distribution range could favour the maintenance of this pre-existing phenotypic plasticity. By contrast, sexually selected traits are more likely to undergo evolutionary divergence when components of sexual selection differ geographically. Here, using data from a common-garden rearing experiment of Western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis Baird and Girard, 1853) from five populations across the species' invasive range in China, we show that invasive mosquitofish have retained plasticity in key physiological (thermal tolerances), morphological and life-history traits even 100 years after their introduction to China, but exhibit heritable population differences in several sexually selected traits, including the shape of the male copulatory organ. Adaptive plasticity of traits linked to immediate survival in different thermal environments—while likely responsible for the species' extraordinary invasion success—could slow down genetic evolution. Several sexually selected traits could diverge geographically and show rapid evolutionary change, e.g., because climate alters selective landscapes arising from mate competition as an indirect consequence of variation in overwinter mortality. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2022,"adaptive plasticity; biological invasion; gambusia affinis; local adaptation; rapid evolution; thermal tolerance","Article","SCOPUS"

An offset measure between the GF-predicted environmental association of adapted alleles and a new environment (GF Offset) is increasingly being used to predict the loss of environmentally adapted alleles under rapid environmental change, but remains mostly untested for this purpose. Here, we explore the robustness of GF Offset to assumption violations, and its relationship to measures of fitness, using SLiM simulations with explicit genome architecture and a spatial metapopulation. We evaluate measures of GF Offset in: (1) a neutral model with no environmental adaptation; (2) a monogenic “population genetic” model with a single environmentally adapted locus; and (3) a polygenic “quantitative genetic” model with two adaptive traits, each adapting to a different environment. We found GF Offset to be broadly correlated with fitness offsets under both single locus and polygenic architectures. However, neutral demography, genomic architecture, and the nature of the adaptive environment can all confound relationships between GF Offset and fitness. GF Offset is a promising tool, but it is important to understand its limitations and underlying assumptions, especially when used in the context of predicting maladaptation. © 2022 The Authors.

"Conservation prioritization based on past cascading climatic effects on genetic diversity and population size dynamics: Insights from a temperate tree species","10.1111/ddi.13490","Liu Y.","Aim: The biogeographic history affects adaptive evolution by altering the pattern of genetic variation and provides the background upon which other evolutionary processes are operating. Assessment of the consequence of such eco-evolutionary interactions is crucial to population's genetic diversity maintenance. Yet, considering how biogeographic and multiple evolutionary processes interact in complex environments to alter genetic diversity in conservation planning remains unresolved. Location: The Pacific Northwest. Methods: Herein I document the impact of geographic landscapes and past climatic fluctuations on the evolutionary processes that drive population divergence of Populus trichocarpa by assembling genomic, climatic and species occurrence data. Results: Based on inferences of demographic history of the species and tests for niche divergence, results show that the British Columbia (BC)-North and BC-South populations are ancestral and subject to more recent bottlenecks than the Oregon population. Consistently, ecological niche modelling illustrates that compared to the Last Glacial Maximum (~21 Ka), the present niche suitability of the BC-North and -South populations is overall marginally inferior to that of the Oregon population. However, genomic analysis demonstrates that the Oregon harbours the lowest genetic diversity, possibly due to an extended bottleneck experienced by the population. Model prediction indicates that in the 2050s, the impact of climate change is minor compared to the niche suitability of the species as a whole, but climate change will likely result in considerable genetic shifts over two generations especially in the Oregon and BC-South populations, which will attenuate along a northward gradient. Main conclusions: This study underpins the long-lasting impact of demographic histories and natural selection on genetic diversity, rather than highlighting the consequence of recent demographic events (e.g. bottleneck in the Holocene epoch; ~12 Ka) potentially cascading to eroding genetic diversity and yielding conservation urgency. © 2022 The Authors.

Drastic loss in genetic diversity at such loci constitutes an extinction risk and should be monitored in species of conservation concern. However, effective implementations of genome-wide immune polymorphism sets into high-throughput genotyping assays are scarce. Here, we report the design and validation of a microfluidics-based amplicon sequencing assay to comprehensively capture genetic variation in Alpine ibex (Capra ibex). This species represents one of the most successful large mammal restorations recovering from a severely depressed census size and a massive loss in diversity at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). We analysed 65 whole-genome sequencing sets of the Alpine ibex and related species to select the most representative markers and to prevent primer binding failures. In total, we designed ~1,000 amplicons densely covering the MHC, further immunity-related genes as well as randomly selected genome-wide markers for the assessment of neutral population structure. Our analysis of 158 individuals shows that the genome-wide markers perform equally well at resolving population structure as RAD-sequencing or low-coverage genome sequencing data sets. Immunity-related loci show unexpectedly high degrees of genetic differentiation within the species. Such information can now be used to define highly targeted individual translocations. Our design strategy can be realistically implemented into genetic surveys of a large range of species. In conclusion, leveraging whole-genome sequencing data sets to design targeted amplicon assays allows the simultaneous monitoring of multiple genetic risk factors and can be translated into species conservation recommendations. © 2021 The Authors.

Little is known about the invertebrates in these habitats and their ability to cope with the brackish conditions of the marsh. We studied the population growth of ostracods found in an inland salt marsh (Maple River salt marsh) and of copepods found in the wetland habitat immediately adjacent to the freshwater Kalamazoo River. By studying these species in water from both habitats, we aimed to find out if they performed differently in the two habitats. We also tested Daphnia pulex in water from the two habitats due to the history of Daphnia spp. as model organisms. We found that copepods performed better in water taken from the Maple River salt marsh, and the ostracods and D. pulex performed equally well in either water. This was unexpected, since ostracods are found in the salt marsh and copepods in the freshwater area. As a second experiment, we tested the invertebrates in pairwise interactions. In water from the Kalamazoo River, ostracods outperformed the other two species, but there was no difference between D. pulex and copepods. No species outperformed the other in salt marsh water. Our results show no local adaptation to salinity, suggesting that ostracods and copepods may be limited in their respective distributions by dispersal limitation or habitat suitability. © Copyright 2021 Breen and Cahill",2021,"copepods; invasive species; ostracods; salinity; species interactions","Article","SCOPUS"

Here we show sub-regional patterns in delta tidal dynamics and coastal SLR along the northern Bay of Bengal based on long-term (1990 to 2017) in-situ measurement data. Seasonal trend decomposition combined with robust linear modelling are applied to determine rates of water level change, with an average rise in coastal extreme sea levels of 6.9 ± 2.1 mm yr−1 translating to increases of 5.1 ± 4.2 mm yr−1 in tidal water levels within the delta. Mean increases of 18.3 ± 4.1 mm yr−1 and 18.2 ± 6.8 mm yr−1 at high and low-tide respectively in tidally dominated rivers of southwest Bangladesh contrast with the fluvially active central and eastern sections of the delta where falling trends of −6.5 ± 2.3 mm yr−1 (high-tide) and −10.2 ± 3.1 mm yr−1 (low-tide) are recorded. Rapid changes in river level at individual sites can occur over periods of ca. 3 to 10 years, most likely resulting from short-term hydro-morphological changes. An acceleration of change in high-tides is indicated by a rise from the long term (1950 to 2018) rate of 4.4 ± 1.5 mm yr−1 to 5.9 ± 3.2 mm yr−1 between 1990 and 2017, leading to increased risk for the local population. At local and regional scales, the inland impact of SLR within the delta is observed to be strongly modulated, necessitating more detailed analysis of driving mechanisms at the site specific level.

In Fiji, several communities have already initiated relocation, with hundreds more considered in need of future relocation by the Fijian government. Yet, often relocation is viewed as an inevitable response to coastal exposure, whereby an entire community is relocated from one location (of high exposure) to another (of lesser exposure) with the assistance of an external actor, namely the State and donors. Limited research has drawn attention to the heterogenous nature of relocation (and immobility responses), and the factors that shape these diverse processes. Drawing on fieldwork undertaken across seven low-lying communities in Fiji that are facing exposure to coastal erosion, tidal inundation, and storm surges, we highlight different immobility and relocation responses that are being implemented both within and across villages. These responses can be viewed along a continuum, referred to here as the immobility-relocation continuum, and include: voluntary immobility, immobility due to restricted relocation options, incremental relocation, partial relocation, and full community relocation. We identify factors - climatic and environmental, past and current adaptations and mobilities, socio-cultural, land rights and tenure, and institutional – that shape these varied responses. This research underscores the need to expand our thinking regarding how climate-related relocation is conceptualized and implemented in policy and practice toward a nuanced understanding of (im)mobility as a form of adaptation to coastal hazard risks, accounting for diversity in local conditions, preferences, and resources available to communities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,"adaptation; climate change; decision making; immobility; local knowledge; managed retreat; migration; sea-level rise","Article","SCOPUS"

ASF is defined as one of the most serious animal diseases identified to date, due to its global spread in regions of Africa, Europe and Asia, causing massive economic losses. On the Italian island of Sardinia, the disease has been endemic since 1978, although the last control measures put in place achieved a significant reduction in ASF, and the virus has been absent from circulation since April 2019. Like many large DNA viruses, ASFV mutates at a relatively slow rate. However, the limited availability of whole‐genome sequences from spatial‐localized outbreaks makes it difficult to explore the small‐scale genetic structure of these ASFV outbreaks. It is also unclear if the genetic variability within outbreaks can be captured in a handful of sequences, or if larger sequencing efforts can improve phylogenetic reconstruction and evolutionary or epidemiological inference. The aim of this study was to investigate the phylogenetic patterns of ASFV outbreaks between 1978 and 2018 in Sardinia, in order to characterize the epidemiological dynamics of the viral strains circulating in this Mediterranean island. To reach this goal, 58 new whole genomes of ASFV isolates were obtained, which represents the largest ASFV whole‐genome sequencing effort to date. We provided a complete description of the genomic diversity of ASFV in terms of nucleotide mutations and small and large indels among the isolates collected during the outbreaks. The new sequences capture more than twice the genomic and phylogenetic diversity of all the previously published Sardinian sequences. The extra genomic diversity increases the resolution of the phylogenetic reconstruction, enabling us to dissect, for the first time, the genetic substructure of the outbreak. We found multiple ASFV subclusters within the phylogeny of the Sardinian epidemic, some of which coexisted in space and time. © 2021 by the authors.

"Transient eco-evolutionary dynamics and the window of opportunity for establishment of immigrants","10.1086/715829","Kilsdonk L.J., Meester L.D.","To what extent does landscape genetic structure bear the signature of arrival order of lineages during population assembly? Rapid genetic adaptation of resident populations founded by early colonists to local conditions might prevent establishment of later-arriving lineages, resulting in an evolution-mediated priority effect. This might result in a limited window of opportunity for establishment during which the resident population did not have sufficient time yet to monopolize the patch through local adaptation. The length of this window of opportunity is expected to depend on the degree to which early colonists and immigrants are preadapted to local habitat conditions. We present an intraspecific competition model of the initial transient population and evolutionary dynamics that quantifies the window of opportunity for establishment for asexual species. The model explicitly addresses the long-lasting effects of evolution-mediated priority effects by tracking lineages through time. Our results show that the difference in initial pread-aptation between early colonists and late immigrants and the speed of evolution codetermine the window of opportunity for establishment. Our results also suggest that local populations should often be dominated by descendants of just a few early colonist lineages and that landscape genetic structure should often reflect the legacy of colonization history. © 2021 The University of Chicago.",2021,"evolution-mediated priority effects; evolutionary population dynamics; monopolization; rapid local adaptation; transient dynamics","Article","SCOPUS"

Gila Trout (Oncorhynchus gilae) is a threatened species found in the Southwestern United States, and is managed to preserve relict populations (i.e., lineages) distributed across a fragmented landscape. We evaluated genomic variation within and among remaining lineages of Gila Trout using RADseq to assess how drift and selection have structured populations using neutral and outlier loci. We also examined whether a signature of hybridization was evident in relict populations. Gila Trout lineages were significantly differentiated from one another and were characterized by low effective population sizes. However, most lineages maintained genomic diversity and are potentially adapted to local conditions. Hybridization with non-native Rainbow Trout (O. mykiss) was not detected in any lineage. All lineages have experienced population bottlenecks associated with mortality from drought and severe wildfires. Current management strategies should be reevaluated and adapted to better account for long-term effects of climate change. Specifically, we suggest reconnecting some populations via dendritic stream networks to facilitate natural dispersal in a metapopulation context. This would allow natural genetic mixing on the landscape and potentially increase adaptive potential.

How genetically limited founder populations give rise to the striking phenotypic and ecological diversity characteristic of adaptive radiations is a paradox of evolutionary biology. We conducted an evolutionary genomics analysis of genus Metrosideros, a landscape-dominant, incipient adaptive radiation of woody plants that spans a striking range of phenotypes and environments across the Hawaiian Islands. Using nanopore-sequencing, we created a chromosome-level genome assembly for Metrosideros polymorpha var. incana and analyzed whole-genome sequences of 131 individuals from 11 taxa sampled across the islands. Demographic modeling and population genomics analyses suggested that Hawaiian Metrosideros originated from a single colonization event and subsequently spread across the archipelago following the formation of new islands. The evolutionary history of Hawaiian Metrosideros shows evidence of extensive reticulation associated with significant sharing of ancestral variation between taxa and secondarily with admixture. Taking advantage of the highly contiguous genome assembly, we investigated the genomic architecture underlying the adaptive radiation and discovered that divergent selection drove the formation of differentiation outliers in paired taxa representing early stages of speciation/divergence. Analysis of the evolutionary origins of the outlier single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showed enrichment for ancestral variations under divergent selection. Our findings suggest that Hawaiian Metrosideros possesses an unexpectedly rich pool of ancestral genetic variation, and the reassortment of these variations has fueled the island adaptive radiation. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

The long history of domestication and the presence of diverse agroecologies in Ethiopia create unique opportunities to study the effect of environmental selective pressures. Species distribution models (SDMs) and Phenotypic distribution models (PDMs) can be applied to investigate the relationship between environmental variation and phenotypic differentiation in wild animals and domestic populations. In the present study we used SDMs and PDMs to detect environmental variables related with habitat suitability and phenotypic differentiation among nondescript Ethiopian indigenous chicken populations. 34 environmental variables (climatic, soil, and vegetation) and 19 quantitative traits were analyzed for 513 adult chickens from 26 populations. To have high variation in the dataset for phenotypic and ecological parameters, animals were sampled from four spatial gradients (each represented by six to seven populations), located in different climatic zones and geographies. Three different ecotypes are proposed based on correlation test between habitat suitability maps and phenotypic clustering of sample populations. These specific ecotypes show phenotypic differentiation, likely in response to environmental selective pressures. Nine environmental variables with the highest contribution to habitat suitability are identified. The relationship between quantitative traits and a few of the environmental variables associated with habitat suitability is non-linear.

Historically, understanding the genetic basis of adaptation has been difficult, but increased availability of genome-wide markers facilitates studies of local adaptation in non-model organisms of conservation concern. The pygmy rabbit (Brachylagus idahoensis) is an imperiled lagomorph that relies on sagebrush for forage and cover. This reliance has led to widespread population declines following reductions in the distribution of sagebrush, leading to geographic separation between populations. In this study, we used >20,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms, genotype-environment association methods, and demographic modeling to examine neutral genetic variation and local adaptation in the pygmy rabbit in Nevada and California. We identified 308 loci as outliers, many of which had functional annotations related to metabolism of plant secondary compounds. Likewise, patterns of spatial variation in outlier loci were correlated with landscape and climatic variables including proximity to streams, sagebrush cover, and precipitation. We found that populations in the Mono Basin of California probably diverged from other Great Basin populations during late Pleistocene climate oscillations, and that this region is adaptively differentiated from other regions in the southern Great Basin despite limited gene flow and low effective population size. Our results demonstrate that peripherally isolated populations can maintain adaptive divergence. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2021,"coalescent simulations; detoxification; landscape genomics; local adaptation; pygmy rabbits","Article","SCOPUS"
"The influence of history, geography and environment on patterns of diversification in the western terrestrial garter snake","10.1111/jbi.14146","Hallas J.M., Parchman T.L., Feldman C.R.","Aim: A central aim of biogeography is to understand how biodiversity is generated and maintained across landscapes. Here, we establish phylogenetic and population genetic patterns in a widespread reptile to quantify the influence of historical biogeography and current environmental variation on patterns of genetic diversity. Location: Western North America. Taxon: Western terrestrial garter snake, Thamnophis elegans. Methods: We used double-digest RADseq to estimate phylogenetic relationships and characterize population genetic structure across the three widespread subspecies of T. elegans: T. e. vagrans (wandering garter snake), T. e. elegans (mountain garter snake) and T. e. terrestris (coast garter snake). We assessed patterns of dispersal and vicariance across biogeographic regions using ancestral area reconstruction (AAR) and deviations from isolation-by-distance across the landscape using estimated effective migration surfaces (EEMS). We identified environmental variables potentially shaping local adaptation in regional lineages using genetic-environment association (GEA) analyses. Results: We recovered three well-differentiated genetic groups that correspond to the three subspecies. AAR analyses inferred the eastern Cascade Range as the ancestral area, with dispersal to both the east and west across western North America. Populations of T. e. elegans displayed a latitudinal gradient in genetic variation across the Sierra Nevada and northern California, while populations of T. e. terrestris show discrete genetic breaks consistent with well-known biogeographic barriers. Lastly, GEA analyses identified allele frequency shifts at loci associated with a common set of environmental variables in both T. e. elegans and T. e. terrestris. Main Conclusion: T. elegans is composed of distinct evolutionary lineages, each with its own geographic range and history of diversification. T. e. elegans and T. e. terrestris show unique patterns of diversification as populations dispersed from east to west and while adapting to the new environments they colonized. Historical events, landscape features and environmental variation have all contributed to patterns of differentiation in T. elegans. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",2021,"ancestral area reconstruction; california floristic province; ddradseq; dispersal; genotype-environment association; phylogeography; population genetics; thamnophis elegans; vicariance; western north america","Article","SCOPUS"
"Identification of putative key genes for thermal adaptation in the Japanese mantis shrimp (Oratosquilla oratoria) through population genomic analysis","10.1016/j.cbd.2021.100828","Lou F., Gao T., Han Z.","Little is known about the mechanisms underlying the relationship between genetic variation and the adaptation of Oratosquilla oratoria populations to different habitat temperature. Here, the genome-wide genetic information of three O. oratoria populations were obtained by IIB restriction site-associated DNA (2b-RAD) sequencing and 2403 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified. Based on the 2403 SNPs, we found a remarkable genetic differentiation between the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea groups of O. oratoria. Furthermore, 63 SNPs are thought to be associated with different sea temperatures. Based on the 63 SNPs, it is hypothesised that the long-term temperature differences may contribute to the variation of genes associated with multiple biological functions, such as material metabolism, cytoskeleton, cellular processes, inflammatory response and hormonal regulation.

A previous phylogenetic study using partial mitochondrial sequences suggested that COTS had diverged into four distinct species, but a nuclear genome-based analysis to confirm this was not conducted. To address this, COTS species nuclear genome sequences were analysed here, sequencing Northern Indian Ocean (NIO) and Red Sea (RS) species genomes for the first time, followed by a comparative analysis with the Pacific Ocean (PO) species. Phylogenetic analysis and ADMIXTURE analysis revealed clear divergences between the three COTS species. Furthermore, within the PO species, the phylogenetic position of the Hawaiian sample was further away from the other Pacific-derived samples than expected based on the mitochondrial data, suggesting that it may be a PO subspecies. The pairwise sequentially Markovian coalescent model showed that the trajectories of the population size diverged by region during the Mid-Pleistocene transition when the sea-level was dramatically decreased, strongly suggesting that the three COTS species experienced allopatric speciation. Analysis of the orthologues indicated that there were remarkable genes with species-specific positive selection in the genomes of the PO and RS species, which suggested that there may be local adaptations in the COTS species. © 2021 The Author(s).

While theory predicts how and when populations at range margins are likely to undergo local adaptation, empirical evidence testing these models remains sparse. Here, we address this knowledge gap by investigating the relationship between selection, gene flow and genetic drift in the yellowtail clownfish, Amphiprion clarkii, from the core to the northern periphery of the species range. Analyses reveal low genetic diversity at the range edge, gene flow from the core to the edge and genomic signatures of local adaptation at 56 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 25 candidate genes, most of which are significantly correlated with minimum annual sea surface temperature. Several of these candidate genes play a role in functions that are upregulated during cold stress, including protein turnover, metabolism and translation.

"How dispersal evolution and local adaptation affect the range dynamics of species lagging behind climate change","10.1086/714130","Block S., Levine J.M.","As climate changes, species’ ability to spatially track suitable climate depends on their spread velocity, a function of their population growth and dispersal capacity. When climate changes faster than species can spread, the climate experienced at species’ expanding range edges may ameliorate as conditions become increasingly similar to those of the range core. When this boosts spe-cies’ growth rates, their spread accelerates. Here, we use simulations of a spreading population with an annual life history to explore how climatic amelioration interacts with dispersal evolution and local adaptation to determine the dynamics of spread. We found that depending on the timing of dispersal evolution, spread velocity can show contrasting trajectories, sometimes transiently exceeding the climate velocity before decelerating. Climatic amelioration can also accelerate the spread of populations composed of genotypes best adapted to local climatic conditions, but the exact dynamics depends on the pattern of climatic adaptation. We conclude that failing to account for demographic variation across climatic gradients can lead to erroneous conclusions about species’ capacity to spatially track suitable climate. © 2021 by The University of Chicago.",2021,"climate gradient; demography; ecotypes; migration lag; population spread; range shifts","Article","SCOPUS"

Likewise, we found no evidence of within-environment trade-offs between heat tolerance and fitness-related traits in any of the environments. Neither short-term and long-term heat tolerance shows any consistent relationship with lipid fluorescence polarization and lipid peroxidation across clones or environments. Pervasive positive correlations between fitness-related traits indicate differences in genetic load rather than trade-off based local adaptation or thermal specialization. For heat tolerance such differences may be caused by either relaxation of stabilizing selection due to lower exposure to high temperature extremes, i.e., conditional neutrality, or by small effective population size followed by the recent range expansion. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,"daphnia; genetic load; heat tolerance; local adaptation; trade-offs","Article","SCOPUS"

Carex buxbaumii and C. hartmaniorum are sister species of the clade Papilliferae within the monophyletic section Racemosae. An unambiguous identification of these species is relatively difficult due to the interspecific continuum of some morphological characters as well as the intraspecific variability. The study was aimed at determining the range of variability, both morphological and genetic, within and between these two closely related and similar species. Methods. The sedges were collected during botanical expeditions to Armenia, Estonia, the Netherlands, and Poland. The morphological separation of the two species and their populations was tested using the Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA). The genetic variability of the 19 Carex populations was assessed in the presence of eight Inter Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) primers. Results. Results of the study indicate a considerable genetic affinity between the two sedge species (mean Si = 0.619). However, the populations of C. hartmaniorum are, morphologically and genetically, more homogenous than the populations of C. buxbaumii. Compared to C. hartmaniorum, C. buxbaumii usually has wider leaf blades, a shorter inflorescence, a lower number of spikes which are shorter, but wider, and longer bracts and utricles. The AMOVA showed a larger variation between the populations of C. buxbaumii, representing 25.65% of the total variation in the taxon. Two populations of C. buxbaumii (from Poland and Estonia) are separated from the remaining populations, both genetically and morphologically; their individuals show shorter utricles and glumes, compared to the typical specimens of C. buxbaumii, and correspond with the morphology of putative infraspecific taxa described by Cajander (var. brevisquamosa and var. confusa). Conclusions. The taxonomic status of the putative infraspecific taxa within C. buxbaumii requires further studies throughout the distribution range of C. buxbaumii, addressing habitats, morphology and genetics (including a chromosome count or a combination of different genetic methods), particularly as the variability in C. buxbaumii may be associated with the species’ polyploid origin. © 2021 Więcław et al.",2021,"discriminant function analysis; genetic affinity; intra- and interpopulation variability; issr polymorphism; phenotypic plasticity; racemosae","Article","SCOPUS"

Comparisons among extant desert-adapted species can highlight parallel or convergent patterns of genome evolution through the identification of shared signatures of selection. We generate a chromosome-level genome assembly for the canyon mouse (Peromyscus crinitus) and test for a signature of parallel evolution by comparing signatures of selective sweeps across population-level genomic resequencing data from another congeneric desert specialist (Peromyscus eremicus) and a widely distributed habitat generalist (Peromyscus maniculatus), that may be locally adapted to arid conditions. We identify few shared candidate loci involved in desert adaptation and do not find support for a shared pattern of parallel evolution. Instead, we hypothesize divergent molecular mechanisms of desert adaptation among deer mice, potentially tied to species-specific historical demography, which may limit or enhance adaptation. We identify a number of candidate loci experiencing selective sweeps in the P. crinitus genome that are implicated in osmoregulation (Trypsin, Prostasin) and metabolic tuning (Kallikrein, eIF2-alpha kinase GCN2, APPL1/2), which may be important for accommodating hot and dry environmental conditions. © The American Genetic Association. 2021.",2021,"dehydration; desert; parallel evolution; peromyscus; thermoregulation","Article","SCOPUS"

Local adaptation inferred from genotype-environment associations may show different genomic patterns depending on the spatial scale of sampling, due to differences in the slope of environmental gradients and the level of gene flow. We compared signatures of local adaptation across the genome of mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans) at two spatial scales: A species-wide data set and a topographically-complex subregional data set. We genotyped 367 individual trees at over 3700 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), quantified patterns of spatial genetic structure among populations, and used two analytical methods to identify loci associated with at least one of three environmental variables at each spatial scale. Together, the analyses identified 549 potentially adaptive SNPs at the subregion scale, and 435 SNPs at the range-wide scale. A total of 39 genic or near-genic SNPs, associated with 28 genes, were identified at both spatial scales, although no SNP was identified by both methods at both scales. We observed that nongenic regions had significantly higher homozygote excess than genic regions, possibly due to selective elimination of inbred genotypes during stand development. Our results suggest that strong environmental selection occurs in mountain ash, and that the identification of putatively adaptive loci can differ substantially depending on the spatial scale of analyses. We also highlight the importance of multiple adaptive genetic architectures for understanding patterns of local adaptation across large heterogenous landscapes, with comparison of putatively adaptive loci among spatial scales providing crucial insights into the process of adaptation. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",2021,"eucalyptus; forest tree; genotype-environment association; local adaptation; microgeographic adaptation","Article","SCOPUS"

However, if genetic variation is limited, the evolution of similar locally adapted traits may be restricted to genetically different and potentially less optimal solutions or prevented from happening altogether. Using a quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping approach, we identified the genomic regions responsible for the repeated pelvic reduction (PR) in three crosses between nine-spined stickleback populations expressing full and reduced pelvic structures. In one cross, PR mapped to linkage group 7 (LG7) containing the gene Pitx1, known to control pelvic reduction also in the three-spined stickleback. In the two other crosses, PR was polygenic and attributed to 10 novel QTL, of which 90% were unique to specific crosses. When screening the genomes from 27 different populations for deletions in the Pitx1 regulatory element, these were only found in the population in which PR mapped to LG7, even though the morphological data indicated large-effect QTL for PR in several other populations as well. Consistent with the available theory and simulations parameterized on empirical data, we hypothesize that the observed variability in genetic architecture of PR is due to heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of standing genetic variation caused by >2× stronger population structuring among freshwater populations and >10× stronger genetic isolation by distance in the sea in nine-spined sticklebacks as compared to three-spined sticklebacks. © 2021 The Authors.

The complex exhibits a wide range of variation in developmental life history strategies, including populations and individuals that undergo metamorphosis; those able to forego metamorphosis and retain a larval, aquatic lifestyle (i.e., paedomorphosis); and those that do both. The evolution of a paedomorphic life history state is thought to lead to increased population genetic differentiation and ultimately reproductive isolation and speciation, but the degree to which it has shaped population- and species-level divergence is poorly understood. Using a large multilocus dataset from hundreds of samples across North America, we identified genetic clusters across the geographic range of the tiger salamander complex. These clusters often contain a mixture of paedomorphic and metamorphic taxa, indicating that geographic isolation has played a larger role in lineage divergence than paedomorphosis in this system. This conclusion is bolstered by geography-informed analyses indicating no effect of life history strategy on population genetic differentiation and by model-based population genetic analyses demonstrating gene flow between adjacent metamorphic and paedomorphic populations. This fine-scale genetic perspective on life history variation establishes a framework for understanding how plasticity, local adaptation, and gene flow contribute to lineage divergence. Many members of the tiger salamander complex are endangered, and the Mexican axolotl is an important model system in regenerative and biomedical research.

Herein, we take the critically endangered Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus) that has both a low dispersal ability and distinct population divergence in different regions as an example. Basin-scale models that represent different populations in the Huanghe River Basin (HRB), the Yangtze River Basin (YRB), and the Pearl River Basin (PRB) were established using ensemble species distribution models. The species ranges under the future human population density (HPD) and climate change were predicted, and the range loss was evaluated for local basins in 2050 and 2070. Our results showed that the predominant factors affecting species distributions differed among basins, and the responses of the species occurrence to HPD and climate factors were distinctly different from northern to southern basins. Future HPD changes would be the most influential factor that engenders negative impacts on the species distribution in all three basins, especially in the HRB. Climate change will likely be less prominent in decreasing the species range, excluding in the YRB and PRB under the highest-emissions scenario in 2050. Overall, the high-emissions scenario would more significantly aggravate the negative impacts produced by HPD change in both 2050 and 2070, with maximum losses of species ranges in the HRB, YRB, and PRB of 83.4%, 60.0%, and 53.5%, respectively, under the scenarios of the combined impacts of HPD and climate changes.

UV irradiation is the most important environmental genotoxic agent. Thus, how elevated UV irradiation may influence human health and ecosystems has generated wide concern in the scientific community, as well as with policy makers and the public in general. In this study, we investigated patterns and mechanisms of UV adaptation in natural ecosystems by studying a gene-specific variation in the potato late blight pathogen, Phytophthora infestans. We compared the sequence characteristics of radiation sensitive 23 (RAD23), a gene involved in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway and UV tolerance, in P. infestans isolates sampled from various altitudes. We found that lower genetic variation in the RAD23 gene was caused by natural selection. The hypothesis that UV irradiation drives this selection was supported by strong correlations between the genomic characteristics and altitudinal origin (historic UV irradiation) of the RAD23 sequences with UV tolerance of the P. infestans isolates. These results indicate that the RAD23 gene plays an important role in the adaptation of P. infestans to UV stress. We also found that different climatic factors could work synergistically to determine the evolutionary adaptation of species, making the influence of climate change on ecological functions and resilience more difficult to predict.

We measured pairwise differentiation among populations using a principal components analysis and used a phylogenetic approach (NeighborNet networks) coupled with a measure of evolutionary distinctiveness (Shapley value) to attribute a priority rank to each population. Overall, we found that prioritization rankings using adaptive variation alone were not significantly divergent from rankings based on genome-wide genetic variation. Our testing framework might be of immediate use to conservation practitioners collecting next-generation sequencing data, and we call for further investigation in other species.

Hence, climate-related disaster preparedness is now acknowledged by climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction experts. However, there is limited knowledge of communities and policy-makers on the integration of climate change adaptation (CCA) and disaster risk reduction (DRR). This paper through the lens of resilience theory presents goals towards linking coastal climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction from the case study of East London, coastal city in South Africa. This study gathered data through a semi-structured survey, aimed at defining salient public issues to improve CCA and DRR policies, public participation inclusion, and programmes. This study shows that the knowledge of CCA and DRR is relatively low in the study area, also the provision of disaster information by the local authority is quite low. Conversely, most of the respondents affirm that available disaster information is always in locally understood languages, this is important in understanding disaster early warning by local dwellers. Accordingly, in disaster information dissemination, the government should be proactive and responsive in spreading information that covers every people. Further work that respects the importance of indigenous knowledge for CCA and DRR integration is needed i.e. local participation in the framework of development endeavours, through the inclusion of indigenous people in policymaking at the sub-national, national and international levels, this would help them to participate in administrative processes that affect them; providing a resilient community, improved adaptive capacity and sustainable living.

Increased environmental changes fueled by human activities are affecting their existence, compromising natural habitats and ecosystems’ biodiversity and functioning. In this context, restoration of disturbed seagrass environments has become a worldwide priority to reverse ecosystem degradation and to recover ecosystem functionality and associated services. Despite the proven importance of genetic research to perform successful restoration projects, this aspect has often been overlooked in seagrass restoration. Here, we aimed to provide a comprehensive perspective of genetic aspects related to seagrass restoration. To this end, we first reviewed the importance of studying the genetic diversity and population structure of target seagrass populations; then, we discussed the pros and cons of different approaches used to restore and/or reinforce degraded populations. In general, the collection of genetic information and the development of connectivity maps are critical steps for any seagrass restoration activity. Traditionally, the selection of donor population preferred the use of local gene pools, thought to be the best adapted to current conditions. However, in the face of rapid ocean changes, alternative approaches such as the use of climate-adjusted or admixture genotypes might provide more sustainable options to secure the survival of restored meadows. Also, we discussed different transplantation strategies applied in seagrasses and emphasized the importance of long-term seagrass monitoring in restoration. The newly developed information on epigenetics as well as the application of assisted evolution strategies were also explored. Finally, a view of legal and ethical issues related to national and international restoration management is included, highlighting improvements and potential new directions to integrate with the genetic assessment. We concluded that a good restoration effort should incorporate: (1) a good understanding of the genetic structure of both donors and populations being restored; (2) the analysis of local environmental conditions and disturbances that affect the site to be restored; (3) the analysis of local adaptation constraints influencing the performances of donor populations and native plants; (4) the integration of distribution/connectivity maps with genetic information and environmental factors relative to the target seagrass populations; (5) the planning of long-term monitoring programs to assess the performance of the restored populations.

Yet, to what extent coexisting closely related species evolve collectively or show distinctive evolutionary responses remains a fundamental ques-tion. To address this, we studied the population genetic structure and morphological differentiation of sympatric three‐spined and nine‐spined stickleback. We conducted genotyping‐by‐sequencing and morphological trait characterisation using 24 individuals of each species from four lowland brackish water (LBW), four lowland freshwater (LFW) and three upland freshwater (UFW) sites in Belgium and the Netherlands. This combination of sites allowed us to contrast populations from isolated but environmentally similar locations (LFW vs. UFW), isolated but environmentally heterogeneous locations (LBW vs. UFW), and well‐connected but environmentally heterogenous locations (LBW vs. LFW). Overall, both species showed comparable levels of genetic diversity and neutral genetic differentiation. However, for all three spatial scales, signatures of morphological and genomic adaptive divergence were substantially stronger among populations of the three‐spined stickleback than among populations of the nine‐spined stickleback. Furthermore, most outlier SNPs in the two species were associated with local freshwater sites. The few outlier SNPs that were associated with the split between brackish water and freshwater populations were located on one linkage group in three‐spined stickleback and two linkage groups in nine‐spined stickleback.

In aquatic environments, species might not be able to redistribute poleward or into deeper water when temperatures rise because of barriers, reduced light availability, altered water chemistry or any combination of these. How species respond to climate change may depend on physiological adaptability, but also on the population dynamics of the species. Density dependence is a ubiquitous force that governs population dynamics and regulates population growth, yet its connections to the impacts of climate change remain little known, especially in marine studies. Reductions in density below an environmental carrying capacity may cause compensatory increases in demographic parameters and population growth rate, hence masking the impacts of climate change on populations. On the other hand, climate-driven deterioration of conditions may reduce environmental carrying capacities, making compensation less likely and populations more susceptible to the effects of stochastic processes. Here we investigate the effects of climate change on Baltic blue mussels using a 17-year dataset on population density. Using a Bayesian modelling framework, we investigate the impacts of climate change, assess the magnitude and effects of density dependence, and project the likelihood of population decline by the year 2030. Our findings show negative impacts of warmer and less saline waters, both outcomes of climate change. We also show that density dependence increases the likelihood of population decline by subjecting the population to the detrimental effects of stochastic processes (i.e. low densities where random bad years can cause local extinction, negating the possibility for random good years to offset bad years). We highlight the importance of understanding, and accounting for both density dependence and climate variation when predicting the impact of climate change on keystone species, such as the Baltic blue mussel. © 2020 British Ecological Society",2021,"bivalvia; climate change; demographic mechanism; density dependence; population projection; salinity; stochastic process; temperature","Article","SCOPUS"
"Signatures of selection in a recent invasion reveal adaptive divergence in a highly vagile invasive species","10.1111/mec.15601","Stuart K.C., Cardilini A.P.A., Cassey P., Richardson M.F., Sherwin W.B., Rollins L.A., Sherman C.D.H.","A detailed understanding of population genetics in invasive populations helps us to identify drivers of successful alien introductions. Here, we investigate putative signals of selection in Australian populations of invasive common starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, and seek to understand how these have been influenced by introduction history. We used reduced representation sequencing to determine population structure, and identify Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) that are putatively under selection. We found that since their introduction into Australia, starling populations have become genetically differentiated despite the potential for high levels of dispersal, and that starlings have responded to selective pressures imposed by a wide range of environmental conditions across their geographic range. Isolation by distance appears to have played a strong role in determining genetic substructure across the starling's Australian range. Analyses of candidate SNPs that are putatively under selection indicated that aridity, precipitation and temperature may be important factors driving adaptive variation across the starling's invasive range in Australia. However, we also noted that the historic introduction regime may leave footprints on sites flagged as being under adaptive selection, and encourage critical interpretation of selection analyses in non-native populations. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",2021,"common starling; invasive species; local adaptation; population genetics; sturnus vulgaris","Article","SCOPUS"
"Intraspecific variation and structuring of phenotype in a lake-dwelling species are driven by lake size and elevation","10.1093/BIOLINNEAN/BLAA137","Peter Koene J., Elmer K.R., Adams C.E.","The fragmented, heterogeneous and relatively depauperate ecosystems of recently glaciated lakes present contrasting ecological opportunities for resident fish. Across a species, local adaptation may induce diverse and distinct phenotypic responses to various selection pressures. We tested for intraspecific phenotypic structuring by population in a common native lake-dwelling fish species across a medium-scale geographic region with considerable variation in lake types. We investigated potential lake-characteristic drivers of trophic morphology. Using geometric morphometric techniques, we quantified the head shapes of 759 adult brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) from 28 lakes and reservoirs across Scotland. Multivariate statistical analyses showed that almost all populations differed from one another. Trout from larger and deeper lakes had deeper, but shorter heads, and smaller eyes. Higher elevation lakes were associated with fish with shorter heads and jaws. Within-population shape variation also differed by population, and was positively correlated with lake surface area and depth. Trout within reservoirs differed subtly from those in natural lakes, having larger eyes, shorter jaws and greater variability. This study documents an extraordinary morphological variation between and within populations of brown trout, and demonstrates the role of the extrinsic environment in driving phenotypic structuring over a medium-scale and varied geographic area. © 2020 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2020, 131, 585-599",2021,"brown trout; ecosystem-size; elevation; morphology; natural lake; phenotype; reservoir; structuring; trophic","Article","SCOPUS"
"High rates of consecutive spawning and precise homing in Sakhalin taimen (Parahucho perryi)","10.1007/s10641-021-01052-4","Fukushima M., Rand P.S.","The frequency of reproduction and homing success are crucial in determining the lifetime reproductive fitness of iteroparous salmonids. We examined consecutive spawning and homing by Sakhalin taimen (Parahucho perryi), one of the least-studied iteroparous salmonids. The average consecutive return rate was 69.5%, the highest ever reported for an iteroparous salmonid. The consecutive return rates were highest for large spawners, females, and individuals with active inter-tributary movements in the preceding year. We estimated tributary-scale repeat homing rates to be 50–87%, which was significantly higher than expected by chance alone. The repeat homing rates were higher for spawners that entered tributaries with more abundant spawners in the preceding year, which is consistent with the pheromone hypothesis because the abundance of spawners in a tributary is expected to correlate to the concentration of chemical homing cues emanating from offspring in the following year. These extremely high consecutive return and homing rates likely facilitated local adaptation over evolutionary time scales and have contributed to population stability in this river system. These same traits, however, may impede species recovery following habitat restoration efforts within the species historic range (e.g. dam barrier removal or improved passage) due to their limited rate of dispersal. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.",2021,"homing; iteroparity; parahucho perryi; pit tagging; repeat spawning; sakhalin taimen","Article","SCOPUS"
"Error, noise and bias in de novo transcriptome assemblies","10.1111/1755-0998.13156","Freedman A.H., Clamp M., Sackton T.B.","De novo transcriptome assembly is a powerful tool, and has been widely used over the last decade for making evolutionary inferences. However, it relies on two implicit assumptions: that the assembled transcriptome is an unbiased representation of the underlying expressed transcriptome, and that expression estimates from the assembly are good, if noisy approximations of the relative abundance of expressed transcripts. Using publicly available data for model organisms, we demonstrate that, across assembly algorithms and data sets, these assumptions are consistently violated. Bias exists at the nucleotide level, with genotyping error rates ranging from 30% to 83%. As a result, diversity is underestimated in transcriptome assemblies, with consistent underestimation of heterozygosity in all but the most inbred samples. Even at the gene level, expression estimates show wide deviations from map-to-reference estimates, and positive bias at lower expression levels. Standard filtering of transcriptome assemblies improves the robustness of gene expression estimates but leads to the loss of a meaningful number of protein-coding genes, including many that are highly expressed. We demonstrate a computational method, length-rescaled CPM, to partly alleviate noise and bias in expression estimates.

The tiger beetle Chaetodera laetescripta exhibits pronounced variation in elytral colour pattern among sandy habitats of different colour in the Japanese Archipelago. In this study, we performed digital image analysis with avian vision modelling to demonstrate that elytral luminance, which is attributed to proportions of elytral colour components, is fine-tuned to match local backgrounds. Field predation experiments with model beetles showed that better luminance matching resulted in a lower attack rate and corresponding lower mortality. Using restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) sequence data, we analysed the dispersal and evolution of colour pattern across geographical locations. We found that sand colour matching occurred irrespective of genetic and geographical distances between populations, suggesting that locally adapted colour patterns evolved after the colonization of these habitats. Given that beetle elytral colour patterns presumably have a quantitative genetic basis, our findings demonstrate that fine-tuning of background-matching camouflage to local habitat conditions can be attained through selection by visual predators, as predicted by the earliest proponent of natural selection. © 2020 The Author(s).",2020,"camouflage; character evolution; coloration; local adaptation","Article","SCOPUS"

The relationships between the timing of a phenological event in a population and its environmental cue can be described by a population-level reaction norm. Variation in reaction norms along environmental gradients may either intensify the environmental effects on timing (cogradient variation) or attenuate the effects (countergradient variation). To resolve spatial and seasonal variation in species' response, we use a unique dataset of 91 taxa and 178 phenological events observed across a network of 472 monitoring sites, spread across the nations of the former Soviet Union. We show that compared to local rates of advancement of phenological events with the advancement of temperature-related cues (i.e., variation within site over years), spatial variation in reaction norms tend to accentuate responses in spring (cogradient variation) and attenuate them in autumn (countergradient variation). As a result, among-population variation in the timing of events is greater in spring and less in autumn than if all populations followed the same reaction norm regardless of location. Despite such signs of local adaptation, overall phenotypic plasticity was not sufficient for phenological events to keep exact pace with their cues-the earlier the year, the more did the timing of the phenological event lag behind the timing of the cue. Overall, these patterns suggest that differences in the spatial versus temporal reaction norms will affect species' response to climate change in opposite ways in spring and autumn. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

We discovered three genotypic variants, one present throughout the latitudinal transect sampled, the others restricted to the north and south, respectively. The latter two showed reciprocal monophyly across all three genomes and significant ecophysiological differences consistent with local adaptation, but produced viable offspring in laboratory crosses.

"Inter- and intraspecific variation in juvenile metabolism and water loss among five biphasic amphibian species","10.1007/s00442-020-04780-z","Messerman A.F., Leal M.","Population persistence is informed by the ability of individuals to cope with local abiotic conditions, which is commonly mediated by physiological traits. Among biphasic amphibians, juveniles—which are infrequently studied but play a key role in amphibian population dynamics—are the first life stage to experience terrestrial conditions following the aquatic larval stage. To illuminate phenotypic variation that may allow juveniles to survive the physiological challenges presented by this transition, we examined respiratory surface area water loss (RSAWL) and standard metabolic rates (SMR) among juveniles reared under common larval conditions for five salamander species (Ambystoma annulatum, A. maculatum, A. opacum, A. talpoideum, and A. texanum) collected across ~ 200 km of latitude in Missouri, USA. We found that SMR described 34% of variation in RSAWL, suggesting that physiological water conservation may be limited by energetic regulation among these species, and vice versa. On average, species differed in juvenile SMR and residual values of RSAWL (corrected for body size/shape) by 0.04 mL CO2·g-1·hr-1 and 0.16, respectively, possibly because of distinct species ecologies. For example, A. annulatum had higher SMR and RSAWL compared to broadly distributed study species, potentially associated with a relatively narrow range of environmental conditions experienced across the small geographic distribution of A. annulatum. Latitude correlated negatively with temperature and precipitation, and positively with RSAWL, suggesting that variation in RSAWL may be adaptive to local conditions. We provide evidence that species differences likely have a genetic basis, reflecting selection favoring species divergence to effectively use distinct microhabitats. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2020,"adaptation; ambystoma; metamorph; physiology; salamander","Article","SCOPUS"
"Pleistocene Ice Ages Created New Evolutionary Lineages, but Limited Speciation in Northeast Pacific Winged Kelp","10.1093/jhered/esaa053","Grant W.S., Bringloe T.T.","The extent that Pleistocene climate variability promoted speciation has been much debated. Here, we surveyed genetic markers in winged kelp Alaria in the Gulf of Alaska, Northeast Pacific Ocean to understand how paleoclimates may have influenced diversity in this kelp. The study included wide geographic sampling over 2800 km and large sample sizes compared to previous studies of this kelp. Mitochondrial 5′-COI (664 bp), plastid rbcL-3′ (740 bp) and 8 microsatellite markers in 16 populations resolved 5 well-defined lineages. COI-rbcL haplotypes were distributed chaotically among populations around the Gulf of Alaska. Principal Coordinates Analysis of microsatellite genotypes grouped plants largely by organellar lineage instead of geography, indicating reproductive isolation among lineages. However, microsatellite markers detected hybrids at 3 sites where lineages co-occurred. Local adaptation on various time scales may be responsible for some genetic differences between populations located along wave-energy and salinity gradients, but the chaotic pattern of variability over hundreds of kilometers is likely due to isolations in northern refugia during Pleistocene ice ages. The range of divergences between populations indicates that episodic glaciations led to the creation of new lineages, but population turnover (local extinctions and recolonizations) limited the formation of new species in the Northeastern Pacific Ocean. © 2020 The American Genetic Association.

By contrast, straying between component stocks may bolster declining populations or allow for colonization of new habitat. To examine rates of natal philopatry and straying among western Lake Erie walleye (Sander vitreus) stocks, we used the concentration of strontium [Sr] in otolith cores to determine the natal origin of adults captured at three major spawning sites: the Sandusky (n = 62) and Maumee (n = 55) rivers and the Ohio reef complex (n = 50) during the 2012–2013 spawning seasons. Mean otolith core [Sr] was consistently and significantly higher for individuals captured in the Sandusky River than for those captured in the Maumee River or Ohio reef complex. Although logistic regression indicates that no individuals with a Maumee River or Ohio reef complex origin were captured in the Sandusky River, quadratic discriminant analysis suggests low rates of straying of fish between the Maumee and Sandusky rivers. Our results suggest little straying and high rates of natal philopatry in the Sandusky River walleye stock. Similar rates of natal philopatry may also exist across western Lake Erie walleye stocks, demonstrating a need for stock-specific management. © 2020 International Association for Great Lakes Research",2020,"la-icp-ms; natal homing; natural tag; spawning behavior; stock discrimination; stock structure","Article","SCOPUS"
"Vulnerability and ecological footprint: a comparison between urban Taipei and rural Yunlin, Taiwan","10.1007/s11356-019-05251-6","Lee Y.-J., Lin S.-Y.","Climate change issues and adaptation strategies have drawn much attention from many fields in recent years. Taiwan, an island state, is deeply threatened by the multiple threats posed by climate change. However, different urban and rural areas have numerous adaptation approaches due to their differences in vulnerability. In Taipei City (urban), its biophysical vulnerability is mainly affected by flooded areas and high flood depths caused by landslides and heavy rains. Its social vulnerability is affected by economic development, high household assets, and population concentration. In Yunlin County (rural), its biophysical vulnerability is also affected by flooded areas and high flood depths caused by heavy rains. Its social vulnerability is affected by the elderly living alone, low household assets, and low healthcare. In order to propose appropriate adaptation strategies of urban and rural areas under different vulnerabilities, this study uses an overlapping method to examine the relationship between the integrated vulnerability (biophysical and social) of Taipei and Yunlin along with the ecological footprint (EF), a measurement of human demands for resources and ecological services. This study reviews the literature and uses Taiwan’s NCDR (National Science and Technology Center for Disaster Reduction) data to analyze the biophysical vulnerability and the social vulnerability and further calculate the integrated vulnerability. In this study, questionnaire surveys were conducted. In Taipei, 446 valid questionnaires were collected, while 393 were collected in Yunlin. The results show that personal EF in Taipei is higher than that in Yunlin. In the end, this study elucidates the relationship between integrated vulnerability and personal EF of Taipei and Yunlin. Four types of risk areas in urban Taipei and rural Yunlin are sorted out (high vulnerability/high EF, high vulnerability/low EF, low vulnerability/high EF, and low vulnerability/low EF). The empirical results can be adopted by local governments, communities, and NGOs to establish appropriate strategies for mitigation and adaptation in the different risk areas. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2020,"biophysical vulnerability; climate change adaptation; ecological footprint; integrated vulnerability; social vulnerability","Article","SCOPUS"

The black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon), is widely distributed throughout the Indian and Pacific Oceans including along the western, northern and eastern coastline of Australia, where it is an important aquaculture and fishery species. Understanding the genetic structure and the influence of environmental factors leading to adaptive differences among populations of this species is important for farm genetic improvement programs and sustainable fisheries management. Results: Based on 278 individuals obtained from seven geographically disparate Australian locations, 10,624 high-quality SNP loci were used to characterize genetic diversity, population structure, genetic connectivity, and adaptive divergence. Significant population structure and differentiation were revealed among wild populations (average F ST = 0.001-0.107; p < 0.05). Eighty-nine putatively outlier SNPs were identified to be potentially associated with environmental variables by using both population differentiation (BayeScan and PCAdapt) and environmental association (redundancy analysis and latent factor mixed model) analysis methods. Clear population structure with similar spatial patterns were observed in both neutral and outlier markers with three genetically distinct groups identified (north Queensland, Northern Territory, and Western Australia). Redundancy, partial redundancy, and multiple regression on distance matrices analyses revealed that both geographical distance and environmental factors interact to generate the structure observed across Australian P. monodon populations. Conclusion: This study provides new insights on genetic population structure of Australian P. monodon in the face of environmental changes, which can be used to advance sustainable fisheries management and aquaculture breeding programs. © 2020 The Author(s).",2020,"aquaculture; functional annotation; genotype-environment interaction; population genetics; prawn","Article","SCOPUS"
"Demographic history and genomics of local adaptation in blue tit populations","10.1111/eva.13035","Perrier C., Rougemont Q., Charmantier A.","Understanding the genomic processes underlying local adaptation is a central aim of modern evolutionary biology. This task requires identifying footprints of local selection but also estimating spatio-temporal variations in population demography and variations in recombination rate and in diversity along the genome. Here, we investigated these parameters in blue tit populations inhabiting deciduous versus evergreen forests, and insular versus mainland areas, in the context of a previously described strong phenotypic differentiation. Neighboring population pairs of deciduous and evergreen habitats were weakly genetically differentiated (FST = 0.003 on average), nevertheless with a statistically significant effect of habitat type on the overall genetic structure. This low differentiation was consistent with the strong and long-lasting gene flow between populations inferred by demographic modeling. In turn, insular and mainland populations were moderately differentiated (FST = 0.08 on average), in line with the inference of moderate ancestral migration, followed by isolation since the end of the last glaciation. Effective population sizes were large, yet smaller on the island than on the mainland. Weak and nonparallel footprints of divergent selection between deciduous and evergreen populations were consistent with their high connectivity and the probable polygenic nature of local adaptation in these habitats. In turn, stronger footprints of divergent selection were identified between long isolated insular versus mainland birds and were more often found in regions of low recombination, as expected from theory. Lastly, we identified a genomic inversion on the mainland, spanning 2.8 Mb.

Escalating climate and global changes present an imminent threat to Pacific communities, particularly for food security, livelihoods, health and safety, cultural identity and biodiversity conservation. A participatory community-based climate change adaptation planning process was used to engage with communities on Rendova Island in Western Province, Solomon Islands to identify local adaptation priorities. The methodology recognized that local community members are the managers of the resources they use daily, have direct knowledge of the status of key local resources and have direct influence over ongoing resource governance. The study focused on two objectives: (1) identifying community priorities and documenting them in adaptation plans intended for local implementation, and (2) evaluating whether community adaptation priorities addressed key vulnerabilities identified independently using a semi-quantitative vulnerability assessment. The adaptation priorities identified by the communities encompassed: governance, leadership and planning; farming and livestock; sustainable livelihoods; natural resource management; and youth capacity building. The community adaptation priorities were found to address the key climate change vulnerabilities identified in the semi-quantitative assessment and also addressed additional drivers of social vulnerability and adaptive capacity. This finding reiterates the importance of fully inclusive and participatory vulnerability assessments and community-identification of adaptation priorities coupled with scientific climate projections to comprehensively assess the complexity of social-ecological systems. The climate change adaptation priorities have informed ongoing local actions and are intended to be used by communities, government and NGOs to focus local effort, funding and project development. A review of the suitability of the adaptation priorities by similar villages on neighbouring islands would determine the utility of scaling-up and applying these adaptations to other rural communities in the Solomon Islands, and possibly more widely in other Pacific communities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2020,"adaptation priorities; climate change adaptation; community-based adaptation; participatory planning; social-ecological systems; solomon islands","Article","SCOPUS"

This study was framed to investigate the population structure of M. micrantha at a large spatial scale in Asia and to identify how introduction history, evolutionary forces and landscape features influenced the genetic pattern of the species in this region. Methods: We assessed the genetic diversity and structure of 1052 individuals from 46 populations for 12 microsatellite loci. The spatial pattern of genetic variation was investigated by estimating the relationship between genetic distance and geographical, climatic and landscape resistances hypothesized to influence gene flow between populations. Key Results: We found high genetic diversity of M. micrantha in this region, as compared with the genetic diversity parameters of other invasive species. Spatial and non-spatial clustering algorithms identified the presence of multiple genetic clusters and admixture between populations. Most of the populations showed heterozygote deficiency, primarily due to inbreeding, and the founder populations showed evidence of a genetic bottleneck. Persistent gene flow throughout the invasive range caused low genetic differentiation among populations and provided beneficial genetic variation to the marginal populations in a heterogeneous environment. Environmental suitability was found to buffer the detrimental effects of inbreeding at the leading edge of range expansion. Both linear and non-linear regression models demonstrated a weak relationship between genetic distance and geographical distance, as well as bioclimatic variables and environmental resistance surfaces. Conclusions: These findings provide evidence that extensive gene flow and admixture between populations have influenced the current genetic pattern of M. micrantha in this region. High gene flow across the invaded landscape may facilitate adaptation, establishment and long-term persistence of the population, thereby indicating the range expansion ability of the species. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Salt marsh systems in California have been highly modified and many salt marsh obligate species have undergone range reductions and habitat loss with concomitant losses of genetic diversity and connectivity. Remaining salt marshes are threatened by rising sea levels, and so these habitats will likely require active restoration and re-establishment efforts. This study aims to provide a reference point for the current status of genetic diversity and range-wide population structure of a federally and state listed endangered plant, salt marsh bird’s-beak (Chloropyron maritimum subsp. maritimum) that can inform future preservation and restoration efforts. We used historical data and current monitoring information to locate and sample all known occurrences throughout the range of this subspecies in southern California, and three additional occurrences from Baja California, Mexico. We used flow cytometry and single nucleotide polymorphic markers (SNPs), generated by double-digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD), to assess relative ploidy, and estimate genetic diversity and population structure across the region. Overall, we found five distinct genetic clusters that coincide with geographic regions. Genetic diversity was greatest in the southern part of the range including Baja California and San Diego. These findings can bolster management and restoration efforts by identifying potentially isolated occurrences and areas that are the richest sources of allelic diversity, and by providing insight into the amount of genetic differentiation across the taxon’s range. © 2020, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.",2020,"chloropyron maritimum subsp. maritimum; genetic diversity; population structure; rare plants; salt marsh bird’s-beak","Article","SCOPUS"

The changing climate is altering species distributions with consequences for population dynamics, resulting in winners and losers in the Anthropocene. 2. Agraulis vanillae, the gulf fritillary butterfly, has expanded its range in the past 100 years in the western U.S.A. Time series analysis is combined with species distribution modelling to investigate factors limiting the distribution of A. vanillae and to predict future shifts under warming scenarios. 3. Time series analyses from the western U.S.A. show that urban development has a positive association with year of colonisation (the host plant Passiflora is an ornamental in gardens). Colonisation was also associated positively and to a lesser extent with winter maximum temperatures, whereas a negative impact of minimum temperatures and precipitation was apparent on population growth rates after establishment. 4. Species distribution models vary by region. In the eastern U.S.A., the butterfly is primarily limited by minimum temperatures in the winter and host availability later in the season. Eastern U.S. projected expansion broadly follows the expectation of poleward distributional shifts, especially for the butterfly's maximum annual extent. Western U.S. distributions are limited by the host plant, which in turn is dependent on urban centres. Projected western U.S. expansion is not limited to a single direction and is driven by urban centres becoming more suitable for the host plant. 5.

"Oceanic and coastal populations of a harvested macroinvertebrate Rochia nilotica in north-western Australia are isolated and may be locally adapted","10.1071/MF19172","Berry O., Richards Z., Moore G., Hernawan U., Travers M., Gruber B.","Marine macroinvertebrates support important fisheries throughout the Indo-Pacific, but stocks of species such as trochus (Rochia nilotica) are easily overharvested. In north-western Australia, trochus are taken from inshore reefs by Indigenous Australians and oceanic reefs by artisanal Indonesian fishers. The management of these environmentally distinct regions relies on understanding their spatial interdependencies, yet connectivity between them has not been evaluated empirically. Here, we used genotype-by-sequencing analysis of 514 trochus samples collected from 17 locations (15 in the inshore Kimberley, 2 offshore oceanic sites). Analysis of 5428 polymorphic single nucleotide polymorphism loci revealed significant genetic subdivision between the oceanic and coastal sites, and a subset of loci exhibited significantly higher subdivision, suggesting they are subject to directional selection. Population differentiation was also evident between the two oceanic sites, but not between coastal sites. Trochus populations from the coastal Kimberley and oceanic reefs represent two genetically and demographically independent units, with preliminary evidence for local adaptation to these distinctive environments. Management strategies for R. nilotica reflect these divisions, but the limited connectivity among oceanic populations indicates that they are vulnerable to overexploitation. Furthermore, their potential adaptive distinctiveness indicates that coastal stocks may be unsuitable for replenishing oceanic stocks. © 2020 CSIRO.",2020,"fisheries management; genomic; population connectivity; tectus; trochus","Article","SCOPUS"
"Population history explains the performance of an annual herb – Within and beyond its European species range","10.1111/1365-2745.13323","Douda J., Doudová J., Hodková E., Vít P., Krak K., Mandák B.","The centre–periphery hypothesis (CPH) predicts a decrease in population performance from the centre of the species range towards the edge, hindering further species expansion. To overcome ecological limitation, local adaptation of peripheral populations is assumed necessary to extend niche space and thus to potentially facilitate species’ range expansion. However, adaptive changes do not necessarily correspond to current ecological marginality. Instead, population history may provide a fuller context for understanding patterns of local adaptation within the species range. Here, we test whether local adaptation to current conditions or population history explains current species distribution in an annual heterocarpic species, Atriplex tatarica, in Europe. The ecological marginality and population history were estimated using species distribution modelling (SDM) and 13 microsatellite markers. To test for local adaptation, we evaluated the population performance of both currently central and currently peripheral populations by examining germination and growth traits under three temperature regimes which correspond to climates within, and also beyond, the species’ current range. In addition, we compared Bayesian estimates of population differentiation in neutral genetic markers and quantitative traits to test whether phenotypic differentiation evolved by local adaptation and/or by genetic drift. We found population performances were not higher under temperature regimes corresponding to their own habitats, suggesting that patterns of local adaptation in A. tatarica do not correspond to current centre–periphery gradient. In contrast, population genetic structure indicated a strong influence of population history on variation in the germination phenotype. Species distribution modelling suggested a more cold–tolerant genetic lineage was located at the species' range periphery during the last glacial period. Meanwhile, a less cold-tolerant lineage occurred in more suitable areas of the Balkan Peninsula and southeastern Europe. Thus, the strong adaptive divergence of evolutionary lineages may reflect a past spatial arrangement of populations, suggesting evolutionary processes were ongoing before the species expansion in the Holocene. Synthesis. There is continuing debate concerning the speed of trait evolution during range expansion with climate change. Our results indicate that even though organisms expand rapidly, the accompanying evolutionary changes in phenotype may be much slower. © 2019 British Ecological Society",2020,"atriplex tatarica; centre–periphery hypothesis; climatic niche; environmental suitability; evolutionary processes; heterocarpy; last glacial maximum; range shift","Article","SCOPUS"
"Rapid Genetic Divergence of an Invasive Species, Spartina alterniflora, in China","10.3389/fgene.2020.00284","Xia L., Geng Q., An S.","Hundreds of plants and half a kilogram of seeds of Spartina alterniflora, which were collected from Morehead City in North Carolina, Sapelo Island in Georgia, and Tampa Bay in Florida, were introduced to China in 1979. However, according to documented records, S. alterniflora from different origins were introduced to different areas when the species was first introduced to the coastal areas of China in the 1980s. In order to understand the relationship between the invasive S. alterniflora populations of China and the native S. alterniflora populations of the United States, and whether the genetic structure and genetic diversity of the invasive populations of China were affected by different introductions in the 1980s, molecular markers were used to determine the levels of gene flow and its effect on population differentiation. A total of 715 samples of S. alterniflora were collected from nine invasive populations in China and nine native populations from the United States. The genetic diversity and genetic structure of invasive and native populations were compared using microsatellite markers. The heterozygosity of Chinese invasive populations of S. alterniflora (HO = 0.538, HE = 0.725) were similar with those of native populations (HO = 0.530, HE = 0.744), which may attribute to its multiple introductions with the multisource populations from different geographic areas of the United States. However, the lower allelic diversities of Chinese invasive populations were detected, which may be due to the founder effect, or the bottleneck, which supports the theory that the allelic diversity is more sensitive to population bottlenecks than heterozygosity. The results of the STRUCTURE analysis among all sampling sites showed that the value of ΔK was largest when K = 2, which indicated that the invasive S. alterniflora populations in China had completed differentiated from the native populations of the United States. This may be because of admixture and hybridization of three non-overlapping original populations, or the postintroduction rapid evolution in China, and reproductive isolation under long-term geographic isolation. There was significant differentiation among invasive populations, which was mainly affected by different human-mediated introductions in 1980s. Significant genetic structure (K = 7) and high genetic differentiation (Fst = 0.30193) were detected in Chinese invasive populations, which may due to the low natural gene flow among populations. The genetic structure of the invasive populations in China was still affected by the human-mediated introductions in the 1980s, and the different initial introductions might promote differentiation among the invasive populations. In fact, the human-mediated long-distance dispersal should take the most of responsibility for the rapid spread of S. alterniflora along the coast of China. Multisource introductions of S. alterniflora are perhaps helpful for local adaptation but itself cannot cause rapid spread along the whole coast of China. Meanwhile, we suggest that the prevention of gene exchange among populations of S. alterniflora is the first and most important step in the control of the species on the coast of China, because admixture and hybridization of isolated populations might generate new heterosis and increase the difficulty of managing S. alterniflora in China. © Copyright © 2020 Xia, Geng and An.",2020,"gene flow; genetic diversity; genetic structure; hybridization; multiple introductions; rapid evolution","Article","SCOPUS"

To help make land-use and climate change adaptation policies more effective at a local scale, this study used a combination of participatory approaches and computer simulationmodeling. Thismethodology (called the ""ParticipatoryWatershed Land-use Management"" (PWLM) approach) consist of four major steps: (a) Scenario analysis, (b) impact assessment, (c) developing adaptation and mitigation measures and its integration in local government policies, and (d) improvement of land use plan. As a test case, we conducted PWLM in the Santa Rosa Sub-watershed of the Philippines, a rapidly urbanizing area outside Metro Manila. The scenario analysis step involved a participatory land-use mapping activity (to understand future likely land-use changes), as well as GCM precipitation and temperature data downscaling (to understand the local climate scenarios). For impact assessment, the Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) tool was used to simulate future river water quality (BOD and E. coli) under a Business as Usual (BAU) scenario and several alternative future scenarios considering different drivers and pressures (to 2030). Water samples from the Santa Rosa River in 2015 showed that BOD values ranged from 13 to 52 mg/L; indicating that the river is already moderately to extremely polluted compared to desirable water quality (class B). In the future scenarios, we found that water quality will deteriorate further by 2030 under all scenarios. Population growth was found to have the highest impact on future water quality deterioration, while climate change had the lowest (although not negligible). After the impact assessment, different mitigation measures were suggested in a stakeholder consultation workshop, and of them (enhanced capacity of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and increased sewerage connection rate) were adopted to generate a final scenario including countermeasures. The main benefit of the PWLM approach are its high level of stakeholder involvement (through co-generation of the research) and use of free (for developing countries) software and models, both of which contribute to an enhanced science-policy interface. © 2020 by the authors.",2020,"climate change adaptation; domestic wastewater management; sustainable development goals; urbanization; water quality; weap","Article","SCOPUS"

Genetic diversity is an important determinant of population fitness and resilience, and can require careful management to ensure sufficient variation is present. In addition, population genetics data reveal patterns of connectivity and gene flow between locations, enabling mangers to predict recovery and resilience, identify areas of local adaptation, and generate restoration plans. Here, we demonstrate a conservation genetics approach to inform restoration and management of the loggerhead sponge (Spheciospongia vesparium) in the Florida Keys, USA. This species is a dominant, habitat-forming component of marine ecosystems in the Caribbean region, but in Florida has suffered numerous mass mortality events. We developed microsatellite markers and used them to genotype sponges from 14 locations in Florida and a site each in The Bahamas, Belize and Barbuda. We found that genetic diversity levels were similar across all sites, but inbreeding and bottleneck signatures were present in Florida. Populations are highly structured at the regional scale, whilst within Florida connectivity is present in a weak isolation by distance pattern, coupled with chaotic genetic patchiness. Evidence of a weak barrier to gene flow was found in Florida among sites situated on opposite sides of the islands in the Middle Keys. Loggerhead sponge populations in Florida are vulnerable in the face of mass mortalities due to low connectivity with other areas in the region, as well as distance-limited and unpredictable local connectivity patterns. However, our discovery of Florida’s high genetic diversity increases hope for resilience to future perturbations.

This debate may, in part, be resolved by considering prey experience, which shapes prey traits (through genetic and plastic change) and influences prey survival (and therefore density). Here, we investigate the cascading role of prey experience through the addition of mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) from predator-experienced or predator-naïve sources to mesocosms containing piscivorous largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), zooplankton, and phytoplankton. These two sources were positioned along a competition-defense tradeoff. Results show that predator-naïve mosquitofish suffered higher depredation rates, which drove a density-mediated cascade, whereas predator-experienced mosquitofish exhibited higher survival but fed less, which drove a trait-mediated cascade. Both cascades were similar in strength, leading to indistinguishable top-down effects on lower trophic levels. Therefore, the accumulation of prey experience with predators can cryptically shift cascade mechanisms from density- to trait-mediated. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2020,"competition-defense tradeoffs; consumptive effects; cryptic dynamics; gambusia affinis; non-consumptive effects; predator experience; trophic cascades","Article","SCOPUS"

The framework parameterized with some synthetic parameters have been coined as VAHMB (Vulnerability assessment for heavy metal bioaccumulation). Tissue metal concentrations (Cadmium, Lead, Mercury) in brown trout (Salmo trutta fario) and habitat metal signatures (sediment loads) was studied in six brooks inside Boletice Military Training Area (Boletice MTA), Czech Republic. Heavy metal burdens in the sediments of military area brooks were flagged safe. The tissue concentration of metals never touched critical limits but numerous cases of breaching Q3-ceilings (>75% of the critical limit) were recorded. Majority of vulnerable bioaccumulation cases were restricted to shooting area (large gears) brooks and observed for Hg. Highest bio-affinity was exhibited by Hg followed by Cd and Pb. Significantly strong, positive multicollinearity exists among heavy metals and between sediment-flesh metal concentrations. No morpho-biological dependency on heavy metal uptake was observed, however, negative implications on population fitness (Fulton's condition factor) was apparent. A ‘nascent heavy metal exposure (NHME)’ at certain sediment metal concentrations was observed during which population fitness steeply deteriorates. It is followed by a ‘range of active adaptation (RAA)’ where deterioration of population fitness finally stabilizes. Under prevailing conditions in Boletice MTA, bioaccumulation of Cd and Pb up to critical levels seem difficult; even though Cd can bioaccumulate beyond Q3-ceilings. Prominent threat exists for reaching critical Hg bioaccumulation levels.

"Shared patterns of genome-wide differentiation are more strongly predicted by geography than by ecology","10.1086/706476","Rennison D.J., Delmore K.E., Samuk K., Owens G.L., Miller S.E.","Closely related populations often display similar patterns of genomic differentiation, yet it remains an open question which ecological and evolutionary forces generate these patterns. The leading hypothesis is that this similarity in divergence is driven by parallel natural selection. However, several recent studies have suggested that these patterns may instead be a product of the depletion of genetic variation that occurs as result of background selection (i.e., linked negative selec-tion). To date, there have been few direct tests of these competing hypotheses. To determine the relative contributions of background selection and parallel selection to patterns of repeated differentiation, we examined 24 independently derived populations of freshwater stickleback occupying a variety of niches and estimated genomic patterns of differentiation in each relative to their common marine ancestor. Patterns of genetic differentiation were strongly correlated across pairs of freshwater populations adapting to the same ecological niche, supporting a role for parallel natural selection. In contrast to other recent work, our study comparing populations adapting to the same niche produced no evidence signifying that similar patterns of genomic differentiation are generated by background selection. We also found that overall patterns of genetic differentiation were considerably more similar for populations found in closer geographic proximity. In fact, the effect of geography on the repeatability of differentiation was greater than that of parallel selection. Our results suggest that shared selective landscapes and ancestral variation are the key drivers of repeated patterns of differentiation in systems that have recently colonized novel environments. © 2019 by The University of Chicago.",2020,"adaptive evolution; gasterosteus aculeatus; genomics; natural selection; parallel evolution; threespine stickleback","Article","SCOPUS"

The Chinese tapertail, or Japanese grenadier anchovy, Coilia nasus, is a valuable migratory fish of high economic importance and special migratory dimorphism (with certain individuals as non-migratory residents). Results: In this study, an 870.0-Mb high-quality genome was assembled by the combination of Illumina and Pacific Biosciences sequencing. Approximately 812.1 Mb of scaffolds were linked to 24 chromosomes using a high-density genetic map from a family of 104 full siblings and their parents. In addition, population sequencing of 96 representative individuals from diverse areas along the putative migration path identified 150 candidate genes, which are mainly enriched in 3 Ca2+-related pathways. Based on integrative genomic and transcriptomic analyses, we determined that the 3 Ca2+-related pathways are critical for promotion of migratory adaption. A large number of molecular markers were also identified, which distinguished migratory individuals and non-migratory freshwater residents.

Vernal pool clam shrimp (Eulimnadia texana) are a promising model due to ease of culturing, short generation time, small genomes, and obligate desiccated diapaused eggs. Clam shrimp are also androdioecious (sexes include males and hermaphrodites), and here we use population-scaled recombination rates to support the hypothesis that the heterogametic sex is recombination free in these shrimp. We collected short-read sequence data from pooled samples from different vernal pools to gain insights into local adaptation. We identify genomic regions in which some populations have allele frequencies that differ significantly from the metapopulation. BayPass (Gautier M. 2015.

Genes located near these regions are involved in Malpighian tubule function and osmoregulation, an essential function in vernal pools.

Rapid organismal responses to thermal environmental changes have been described for several ectotherms; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms often remain unclear. Here, we studied whole genome cytosine methylation patterns of European grayling (Thymallus thymallus) embryos from five populations with contemporary adaptations of early life history traits at either ‘colder’ or ‘warmer’ spawning grounds. We reared fish embryos in a common garden experiment using two temperatures that resembled the ‘colder’ and ‘warmer’ conditions of the natal natural environments. Genome-wide methylation patterns were similar in populations originating from colder thermal origin subpopulations, whereas single nucleotide polymorphisms uncovered from the same data identified strong population structure among isolated populations, but limited structure among interconnected populations. This was surprising, because the previously studied gene expression response among populations was mostly plastic, and mainly influenced by the developmental temperature. These findings support the hypothesis of the magnified role of epigenetic mechanisms in modulating plasticity. The abundance of consistently changing methylation loci between two warmer-to-colder thermal origin population pairs suggests that local adaptation has shaped the observed methylation patterns. The dynamic nature of the methylomes was further highlighted by genome-wide and site-specific plastic responses. Our findings support both the presence of a plastic response in a subset of CpG loci, and the evolutionary role of methylation divergence between populations adapting to contrasting thermal environments. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2020,"cytosine methylation; developmental plasticity; epigenetic variation; promoter; salmonid; snp; thermal adaptation; transcription","Article","SCOPUS"

Over the last several decades, the Northwest Atlantic off Newfoundland, Canada has experienced wide variation in temperature and significant changes in the structure of the marine community. A period of particularly cold ocean conditions from the mid-1980s to mid-1990s saw Greenland halibut occupying deeper waters, and moving farther offshore and southward. Distributional shifts across periods of varying thermal conditions were most pronounced in the youngest ages. While no specific nursery areas were evident, these young fish typically occurred in shallower waters where temperatures were more variable, moving deeper with age. Sensitivity to changing ocean climate may vary with age. This adaptation to shifting temperatures suggests that this species is likely to alter its distribution in the face of continued changes in ocean climate.

Previous studies suggested that there might be demographic differences between coastal lagoons and riverine environments, as well as divergent populations that could be reproductively isolated. Here, we investigated the genetic diversity pattern of this taxon in the Southern Neotropical Basin system that includes the La Plata Basin, Patos-Merin lagoon basin and the coastal lagoons draining to the SW Atlantic Ocean, through a population genomics approach using 2b-RAD-sequencing-derived single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The genomic scan identified selection footprints associated with divergence and suggested local adaptation environmental drivers. Two major genomic clusters latitudinally distributed in the Northern and Southern basins were identified, along with consistent signatures of divergent selection between them.

"Genetic structure of Australian glass shrimp, Paratya australiensis, in relation to altitude","10.7717/peerj.8139","Rahman S., Schmidt D., Hughes J.M.","Paratya australiensis Kemp (Decapoda: Atyidae) is a widely distributed freshwater shrimp in eastern Australia. The species has been considered as an important stream organism for studying genetics, dispersal, biology, behaviour and evolution in atyids and is a major food source for stream dwelling fishes. Paratya australiensis is a cryptic species complex consisting of nine highly divergent mitochondrial DNA lineages. Previous studies in southeast Queensland showed that ""lineage 4"" favours upstream sites at higher altitudes, with cooler water temperatures. This study aims to identify putative selection and population structure between high elevation and low elevation populations of this lineage at relatively small spatial scales. Sample localities were selected from three streams: Booloumba Creek, Broken Bridge Creek and Obi Obi Creek in the Conondale Range, southeast Queensland. Six sample localities, consisting of 142 individuals in total were sequenced using double digest Restriction Site Associated DNA-sequencing (ddRAD-seq) technique. Among the 142 individuals, 131 individuals shared 213 loci. Outlier analysis on 213 loci showed that 27 loci were putatively under selection between high elevation and low elevation populations. Outlier analysis on individual streams was also done to test for parallel patterns of adaptation, but there was no evidence of a parallel pattern. Population structure was observed using both the 27 outliers and 186 neutral loci and revealed similar population structure in both cases. Therefore, we cannot differentiate between selection and drift here. The highest genetic differentiation was observed between high elevation and low elevation populations of Booloumba Creek, with small levels of differentiation in the other two streams. © 2020 Rahman et al.",2020,"freshwater shrimp; genetic structure; local adaptation; outliers; stream network","Article","SCOPUS"
"Absence of founder effect and evidence for adaptive divergence in a recently introduced insular population of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus)","10.1111/mec.15317","Fuller J., Ferchaud A.-L., Laporte M., Le Luyer J., Davis T.B., Côté S.D., Bernatchez L.","Islands are generally colonized by few individuals which could lead to a founder effect causing loss of genetic diversity and rapid divergence by strong genetic drift. Insular conditions can also induce new selective pressures on populations. Here, we investigated the extent of genetic differentiation within a white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) population introduced on an island and its differentiation with its source mainland population. In response to their novel environmental conditions, introduced deer changed phenotypically from mainland individuals, therefore we investigated the genetic bases of the morphological differentiation. The study was conducted on Anticosti Island (Québec, Canada) where 220 individuals were introduced 120 years ago, resulting in a population size over 160,000 individuals. We used genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) to generate 8,518 filtered high-quality SNPs and compared patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation between the continental and Anticosti Island populations. Clustering analyses indicated a single panmictic island population and no sign of isolation by distance. Our results revealed a weak, albeit highly significant, genetic differentiation between the Anticosti Island population and its source population (mean FST = 0.005), which allowed a population assignment success of 93%. Also, the high genetic diversity maintained in the introduced population supports the absence of a strong founder effect due to the large number of founders followed by rapid population growth. We further used a polygenic approach to assess the genetic bases of the divergent phenotypical traits between insular and continental populations. We found loci related to muscular function and lipid metabolism, which suggested that these could be involved in local adaptation on Anticosti Island.

"The use of linear mixed effects models to investigate local adaptation in marine fish subpopulations: Case study, changing spawning times of common sole (Solea solea)","10.1093/icesjms/fsz175","Fincham J.I., Barry J., Bartolino V.","Populations along environmental gradients have the potential to adapt to their own local environments. It is important to understand these adaptations in fisheries stocks to fully inform fisheries management strategies. With this is mind, sea temperatures are an important cue in timing for many marine species, including sole in the North-East Atlantic Ocean. We used spawning data and modelled sea surface temperature (SST) data from sole subpopulations to examine the possibility of local adaptation of their spawning times to rising temperature. Climate window analysis was used, in a linear mixed model using mean spawning week and SST, to investigate statistically significant differences between subpopulations of sole. There was no evidence of local adaptation to changing temperatures for these subpopulations. This suggests that their spawning-time reaction to changing temperatures is currently due to their subpopulation's mean plasticity. Using climate window analysis and modelled temperature data we have demonstrated a method of examining spawning changes in marine populations along a temperature gradient. Recruitment and spawning success are key elements of fisheries population models which contribute to fisheries management. Further understanding of the influence of temperature on recruitment will help inform future modelling. © 2019 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2019.

"The effects of diadromy and its loss on genomic divergence: The case of amphidromous Galaxias maculatus populations","10.1111/mec.15290","Delgado M.L., Górski K., Habit E., Ruzzante D.E.","Understanding the evolutionary mechanisms that affect the genetic divergence between diadromous and resident populations across heterogeneous environments is a challenging task. While diadromy may promote gene flow leading to a lack of genetic differentiation among populations, resident populations tend to be affected by local adaptation and/or plasticity. Studies on these effects on genomic divergence in nonmodel amphidromous species are scarce. Galaxias maculatus, one of the most widespread fish species in the Southern Hemisphere, exhibits two life histories, an ancestral diadromous, specifically, amphidromous form, and a derived freshwater resident form. We examined the genetic diversity and divergence among 20 estuarine and resident populations across the Chilean distribution of G. maculatus and assessed the extent to which selection is involved in the differentiation among resident populations. We obtained nearly 4,400 SNP markers using a RADcap approach for 224 individuals. As expected, collections from estuarine locations typically consist of diadromous individuals. Diadromous populations are highly differentiated from their resident counterparts by both neutral and putative adaptive markers. While diadromous populations exhibit high gene flow and lack site fidelity, resident populations appear to be the product of different colonization events with relatively low genetic diversity and varying levels of gene flow. In particular, the northernmost resident populations were clearly genetically distinct and reproductively isolated from each other suggesting local adaptation.

"The adaptive value of epigenetic mutation: Limited in large but high in small peripheral populations","10.1111/jeb.13535","Smithson M.W., Dybdahl M.F., Nuismer S.L.","The fate of populations during range expansions, invasions and environmental changes is largely influenced by their ability to adapt to peripheral habitats. Recent models demonstrate that stable epigenetic modifications of gene expression that occur more frequently than genetic mutations can both help and hinder adaptation in panmictic populations. However, these models do not consider interactions between epimutations and evolutionary forces in peripheral populations. Here, we use mainland–island mathematical models and simulations to explore how the faster rate of epigenetic mutation compared to genetic mutations interacts with migration, selection and genetic drift to affect adaptation in peripheral populations. Our model focuses on cases where epigenetic marks are stably inherited. In a large peripheral population, where the effect of genetic drift is negligible, our analyses suggest that epimutations with random fitness impacts that occur at rates as high as 10–3 increase local adaptation when migration is strong enough to overwhelm divergent selection. When migration is weak relative to selection and epimutations with random fitness impacts decrease adaptation, we find epigenetic modifications must be highly adaptively biased to enhance adaptation. Finally, in small peripheral populations, where genetic drift is strong, epimutations contribute to adaptation under a wider range of evolutionary conditions. Overall, our results suggest that epimutations can change outcomes of adaptation in peripheral populations, which has implications for understanding conservation and range expansions and contractions, especially of small populations. © 2019 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, since genetic change can establish similar phenotypes to plasticity. This connection between both mechanisms raises the question of how much of the variation observed between species or populations is plastic and how much of it is genetic. In this study, we used a structured population of fire salamanders (Salamandra salamandra), in which two subpopulations differ in terms of physiology, genetics, mate-, and habitat preferences. Our goal was to identify candidate genes for differential habitat adaptation in this system, and to explore the degree of plasticity compared to local adaptation. We therefore performed a reciprocal transfer experiment of stream-and pond-originated salamander larvae and analyzed changes in morphology and transcriptomic profile (using species-specific microarrays). We observed that stream-and pond-originated individuals diverge in morphology and gene expression. For instance, pond-originated larvae have larger gills, likely to cope with oxygen-poor ponds. When transferred to streams, pond-originated larvae showed a high degree of plasticity, resembling the morphology and gene expression of stream-originated larvae (reversion); however the same was not found for stream-originated larvae when transferred to ponds, where the expression of genes related to reduction-oxidation processes was increased, possibly to cope with environmental stress. The lack of symmetrical responses between transplanted animals highlights the fact that the adaptations are not fully plastic and that some level of local adaptation has already occurred in this population. This study illuminates the process by which phenotypic plasticity allows local adaptation to new environments and its potential role in the pathway of incipient speciation. © 2019 by the authors.

Its wide distribution ranges from temperate waters in the Atlantic coast of South America (39°S, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina) to the Sub-Antarctic environment of Cape Horn (56°S). A previous study has shown significant intraspecific differences on growth parameters and otolith morphology between the southern peripheral population of O. nigricans in the Beagle Channel and the populations in the Atlantic coast of Tierra del Fuego. In this work, we report the first data on population genetics of O. nigricans along the southern part of its distributional range, including the peripheral populations of Beagle Channel. To examine the genetic variability, we analyzed 224 sequences of 815 bp of mitochondrial control region generated from individuals captured at two sites in the Beagle Channel and six sites at the Atlantic coast. The genetic structure assessment revealed a sharp phylogeographic division between Beagle Channel and the Atlantic coast of Patagonia with a 39.83% of variance among groups. The observed genetic diversity was lower in Beagle Channel than in the Atlantic coast sites and the demographic analyses are compatible with a scenario of past population expansion, especially in Beagle Channel. We hypothesize two possible scenarios: one is a recent colonization of the Beagle Channel from the Atlantic Coast followed by divergence promoted by adaptation to local conditions. On the other hand, population differentiation may have been attained or initiated in allopatric conditions during Quaternary glacial phases and the populations may now be experiencing a secondary contact near the eastern tip of Tierra del Fuego. These hypotheses should be addressed in the future with genomics tools. By now, these populations should be considered as different units for conservation and management purposes. © 2019",2019,"atherinomorpha; biogeography; genetic; silversides; speciation","Article","SCOPUS"

RNA-sequencing studies have successfully characterized gene expression differences among populations experiencing divergent environmental conditions in a wide variety of taxa. However, few of these studies have identified transcriptomic signatures to multivariate, environmental stimuli among populations in their natural environments. Herein, we aim to identify environmental and sex-driven patterns of gene expression in the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii), a critically endangered species that occupies a heterogeneous environment. We performed RNA-sequencing on ear tissue biopsies from adult male and female devils from three populations at the extremes of their geographic range. There were no transcriptome-wide patterns of differential gene expression that would be suggestive of significant, environmentally-driven transcriptomic responses. The general lack of transcriptome-wide variation in gene expression levels across the devil’s geographic range is consistent with previous studies that documented low levels of genetic variation in the species. However, genes previously implicated in local adaptation to abiotic environment in devils were enriched for differentially expressed genes.

"Life history and temporal variability of escape events interactively determine the fitness consequences of aquaculture escapees on wild populations","10.1016/j.tpb.2018.12.006","Yang L., Waples R.S., Baskett M.L.","Domesticated individuals are likely to be maladaptive in the wild due to adaptation to captivity. Escaped aquaculture fish can cause unintended fitness and demographic consequences for their wild conspecifics through interbreeding and competition. Escape events from different sources exhibit great heterogeneity in their frequencies and magnitudes, ranging from rare but large spillover during a storm, to continuous low-level leakage caused by operational errors. The timescale of escape events determines the distribution of gene flow from aquaculture to the wild. The evolutionary consequences of this variation in timescale will depend on the degree of generation overlap and the focal species’ life history attributes, especially those under selection in aquaculture (e.g., growth rate, which can influence additional demographically important traits such as age at maturity). To evaluate the effects of variable escape both within and across generations, we construct an age-structured model of coupled genetic and demographic dynamics and parameterize it for species with contrasting life history characteristics (Salmo salar and Gadus morhua). Our results are consistent with earlier discrete-generation models that constant, low-level spillover can have a greater impact than rare, large pulses of leakage, even after accounting for the averaging effects of overlapping generations. The age-structured model also allows detailed evaluation of the role of different life history traits, which reveals that species with longer generation times might experience greater fitness consequences of aquaculture spillover but are less sensitive to variability in spillover. Additionally, environment-induced earlier maturity of escapees can increase the fitness effects on wild fish, especially those with shorter generation times. Our results suggest that effective management to minimize the unintended fitness consequences of aquaculture releases might require extensive monitoring efforts on constant, low-level spillover and assessment of the focal species’ life history characteristics. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",2019,"age structure; aquaculture; gadus morhua; gene flow; life history; salmo salar","Article","SCOPUS"
"Cold adaptation in the Asian tiger mosquito's native range precedes its invasion success in temperate regions","10.1111/evo.13801","Sherpa S., Blum M.G.B., Després L.","Adaptation to environmental conditions within the native range of exotic species can condition the invasion success of these species outside their range. The striking success of the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, to invade temperate regions has been attributed to the winter survival of diapause eggs in cold environments. In this study, we evaluate genetic polymorphisms (SNPs) and wing morphometric variation among three biogeographical regions of the native range of A. albopictus. Reconstructed demographic histories of populations show an initial expansion in Southeast Asia and suggest that marine regression during late Pleistocene and climate warming after the last glacial period favored expansion of populations in southern and northern regions, respectively. Searching for genomic signatures of selection, we identified significantly differentiated SNPs among which several are located in or within 20 kb distance from candidate genes for cold adaptation. These genes involve cellular and metabolic processes and several of them have been shown to be differentially expressed under diapausing conditions. The three biogeographical regions also differ for wing size and shape, and wing size increases with latitude supporting Bergmann's rule. Adaptive genetic and morphometric variation observed along the climatic gradient of A. albopictus native range suggests that colonization of northern latitudes promoted adaptation to cold environments prior to its worldwide invasion. © 2019 The Author(s).

Adult specimens of Scleromystax barbatus and Scleromystax macropterus were collected from the sub-basin of the Nhundiaquara River and the sub-basin of the Paranaguá Bay, state of Paraná, Brazil. Four species of Gyrodactylus were recovered from the body surface of both host species. Morphometric analysis of Gyrodactylus spp. and Scleromystax spp. indicated that subpopulations of parasites and hosts could be distinguished from different sub-basins and locations, but the degree of morphological differentiation seems to be little related to geographic distance between subpopulations. Phylogenetic relationships based on DNA sequences of Gyrodactylus spp. and Scleromystax spp. allowed distinguishing lineages of parasites and hosts from different sub-basins. However, the level of genetic structuring of parasites was higher in comparison to host species. Evidence of positive selection in mtDNA sequences is likely associated with local adaptation of lineages of parasites and hosts. A historical demographic analysis revealed that populations of Gyrodactylus and Scleromystax have expanded in the last 250 000 years.

Changes in the phenotype of an invasive species may also trigger variations in its community level impacts, which is an acceptable, yet unexplored aspect of invasion biology. Our study attempts to fill important knowledge gaps on the basic behavior and ecological interactions of invasive species. Parthenium hysterophorus, a widely distributed invasive alien species of tropical and sub-tropical regions, was evaluated for variations in its morpho-functional traits and ecological performance at a common spatial and temporal scale. Field surveys were conducted in Chandigarh, India, in five sites identified as invaded with P. hysterophorus. Individuals of P. hysterophorus randomly sampled from these sites, showed from trait analyses that the population is differentiated into two morphotypes, P A and P B . Morphotype P B exhibits traits comparable to the shrub life-form in terms of woody stem (with higher stem circumference [+32.26%], stem specific density [+128.57%], twig dry matter content [+25.15%]); profuse branching (+46.38%); larger canopy (+91.16%); and better reproductive output (+190.29%) compared to P A. P A , on the other hand, reflected herbaceous characteristics with greater leaf area (+67.58%) and higher content of chlorophyll (+21.92%) compared to P B . Based on these morphotypes, the plots were divided into three invasion categories: areas invaded by P A [IP A ], areas invaded by P B [IP B ] and uninvaded areas [UI]. Ecological indices and soil chemical properties were compared across IP A , IP B and UI. Shannon's index (p &lt; 0.001), evenness index (p = 0.008), and richness index (p &lt; 0.001) were significantly lower in IP B compared to IP A . UI areas were found to have higher soil pH, phenolics, organic matter, and concentrations of N, P and K, compared to IP A and IP B , but lower Ca and Mg. Results suggest that phenotypic variations within population of P. hysterophorus regulate its ecological impact on associated vegetation.

The species is also thought to have undergone a recent range expansion. We aimed to describe the genetic and morphological variation of the Israeli populations and to determine the extent of gene flow among them. We expected that because of the small latitudinal gradient across Israel and the recent range expansion of the species that Dead Sea Sparrow populations would show no significant morphological adaptation to local environmental conditions, and that considerable gene flow would be taking place among populations. Our findings indicate the existence of gene flow, suggesting high connectivity among populations, but recovered no support for a recent range expansion, possibly due to insufficient time since expansion for mutations to have accumulated.

Genome-wide population surveys of both natural and introduced populations provide insights into genetic diversity, the evolutionary processes and the genetic basis underlying local adaptation. Grass carp is the most important freshwater foodfish species for food and water weed control. However, there is as yet no overall picture on genetic variations and population structure of this species, which is important for its aquaculture. Results: We used 43,310 SNPs to infer the population structure, evidence of local adaptation and sources of introduction. The overall genetic differentiation of this species was low. The native populations were differentiated into three genetic clusters, corresponding to the Yangtze, Pearl and Heilongjiang River Systems, respectively. The populations in Malaysia, India and Nepal were introduced from both the Yangtze and Pearl River Systems. Loci and genes involved in putative local selection for native locations were identified. Evidence of both positive and balancing selection was found in the introduced locations. Genes associated with loci under putative selection were involved in many biological functions. Outlier loci were grouped into clusters as genomic islands within some specific genomic regions, which likely agrees with the divergence hitchhiking scenario of divergence-with-gene-flow. Conclusions: This study, for the first time, sheds novel insights on the population differentiation of the grass carp, genetics of its strong ability in adaption to diverse environments and sources of some introduced grass carp populations.

Secondary data collected from the Indian Meteorological Department, the Water Resources Information System of India and the Global Sea Level Observing System have been used to identify dynamics of climate change by employing statistical and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques. A GPS survey has been conducted to identify locations of embankment breaching, and satellite images obtained from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and U.S. Geological Survey (NASA USGS) Government website have been applied to shoreline and land use change detection, using a supervised maximum likelihood classification. The results indicate that the study area has experienced increasing temperature, changing precipitation patterns, rise in sea level, higher storm surges, shoreline change, constant land loss, embankment breaching and changing land use, which have had impact on vulnerability, particularly of poorer people. The LVI (0.48 to 0.68) and LVI-IPCC (0.04 to 0.14) scores suggest that the populations of Dhablat, Bankimnagar, Sumatinagar, Muri Ganga and Sibpur mouzas are highly vulnerable (LVI scores of 0.60 to 0.68 and LVI-IPCC scores of 0.11 to 0.14) to climate change both because the communities are more exposed to it, and because poor access to food, health facilities and water makes them extremely sensitive to it and lowers their adaptive capacity. The findings of this study could be crucial to framing further development and adaptation strategies relating to climate change, and to safeguarding the estuarine ecosystem and the vulnerable population. © 2019, Science Press, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2019,"adaptation strategies; climate change; estuarine ecosystem; livelihood vulnerability index (lvi); vulnerable population","Article","SCOPUS"

The multi-generational test consisted generally of a continuous Pb exposed set of organisms, plus an extra control set running simultaneously. To assess daphnids recovery after Pb exposure, some organisms from the sixth generation were transferred to clean media for three extra generations (recovery period; F6 to F9), while others were keep Pb exposed. All setups (control, Pb exposure and recovery period) were submitted to two different dietary regimes, the standard (3 × 10 5 cells/mL) and restricted food (1.5 × 10 5 cells/mL) regimes. To evaluate the effects of generational Pb exposure and food regimes, individual, functional and population related endpoints were assessed (number of offspring, body length and rate of population increase (r) and feeding rate (FR)). The tests were conducted on the first (F0) and last generations (F9). No differences were shown on number of offspring and feeding among F9 control and continuous Pb exposed D. magna, although a higher r was shown for F9 Pb exposed organisms. F9 Pb exposed D. similis also presented a higher r than F9 control, however, lethality was induced at high Pb exposure levels. At food restriction the patterns were opposite and D. magna died at high Pb exposure while Pb exposed D. similis was the only setup (compared to control and recovery period) to survive at high Pb exposure levels. Regarding the recovery period, D. magna (standard food) did not cope well with the Pb re-exposure and lethality was induced, while D. similis indicate a decreased Pb sensitivity (only setup that survived high Pb exposure levels). Under food restriction, both species presented a decreased Pb sensitivity and consequent failed recovery (possibly due to epigenetic changes). Both species presented similar patterns regarding generations. Organisms from F0 presented enhanced reproductive outputs in comparison to F9 and the contrary occurred to the FR (even in control organisms). Data show an acclimation under a generational Pb exposure, which could increase the population of adapted organisms in natural habitats. And, since there was not a full recovery after three generations in clean media, an indication of epigenetic changes for both species may also be considered. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",2019,"daphnids; feeding rate; lead; multi-generation; reproduction endpoints","Article","SCOPUS"

Our results show that: (i) Indigenous peoples are observing modifications to their country due to climate change, and are doing so in both ancient and colonial time scales; (ii) the ways that climate change terminology is discursively understood and used is fundamental to achieving deep engagement and effective adaptive governance; (iii) Indigenous peoples in Australia exhibit a high level of agency via diverse approaches to climate adaptation; and (iv) humour is perceived as an important cultural component of engagement about climate change and adaptation. However, wider governance regimes consistently attempt to “upscale” Indigenous initiatives into their own culturally governed frameworks - or ignore them totally as they “don't fit” within neoliberal policy regimes. We argue that an opportunity exists to acknowledge the ways in which Indigenous peoples are agents of their own change, and to support the strategic localism of Indigenous adaptation approaches through tailored and place-based adaptation for traditional country. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

"Evidence for different thermal ecotypes in range centre and trailing edge kelp populations","10.1016/j.jembe.2019.03.004","King N.G., McKeown N.J., Smale D.A., Wilcockson D.C., Hoelters L., Groves E.A., Stamp T., Moore P.J.","Determining and predicting species’ responses to climate change is a fundamental goal of contemporary ecology. When interpreting responses to warming species are often treated as a single physiological unit with a single species-wide thermal niche. This assumes that trailing edge populations are most vulnerable to warming, as it is here where a species’ thermal niche will be exceeded first. Local adaptation can, however, result in narrower thermal tolerance limits for local populations, so that similar relative increases in temperature can exceed local niches throughout a species range. We used a combination of common garden temperature heat-shock experiments (8–32 °C) and population genetics (microsatellites) to identify thermal ecotypes of northeast Atlantic range centre and trailing edge populations of the habitat-forming kelp, Laminaria digitata. Using upregulation of hsp70 as an indicator of thermal stress, we found that trailing edge populations were better equipped to tolerate acute temperature shocks. This pattern was consistent across seasons, indicating that between-population variability is fixed. High genetic structuring was also observed, with range centre and trailing edge populations representing highly distinct clusters with little gene flow between regions. Taken together, this suggests the presence of distinct thermal ecotypes for L. digitata, which may mean responses to future warming are more complex than linear range contractions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",2019,"climate change; heat shock; laminaria digitata; range-centre; trailing-edge","Article","SCOPUS"

Montane animals escape warming conditions at low elevation by moving upslope, but may be physiologically constrained by conditions there. Effects of elevation were studied for montane populations of the leaf beetle Chrysomela aeneicollis, where allele frequencies at nuclear genes and the mitochondrion vary along latitudinal and altitudinal gradients. A population presence survey conducted along a steep altitudinal transect (1,600–3,800 m) from 1981 to 2018 revealed that populations expand to low elevation following wet winters and retreat during drought. Quantitative surveys of a 45-site population network conducted from 2012 to 2018 along multiple altitudinal transects show that when beetles are abundant, population size peaks at 3,135 m, highest altitude populations are at the southern edge of the range, and populations decline and extirpate during drought, especially at low elevation. To examine effects of elevation on measures of performance and fitness, beetles from a genetically introgressed population (Bishop Creek) were examined. In nature, fecundity of females transplanted along natural altitudinal transects was measured, as was thorax cytochrome c oxidase (CytOx) activity. To examine effects of environmental hypoxia independent of other factors limiting persistence at high elevation, development rate and activity of malate dehydrogenase (MDH) were measured for larvae reared under otherwise common garden conditions at low (1,250 m) and high (3,800 m) elevation. In nature, fecundity declined with increasing elevation, independent of air temperature. CytOx activity was higher at high than low elevation, especially for individuals possessing genotypes of southern origin. Laboratory-reared larvae with southern mitochondrial haplotypes developed equally well at both elevations, but larvae with northern haplotypes developed more slowly at high elevation. MDH activity showed a similar pattern, suggesting that slower development rates at high elevation may be due to reduction in metabolic rate. These findings suggest that physiological effects of environmental hypoxia may contribute to other factors known to restrict insects’ ability to persist at high elevation, ultimately disrupting associated ecological communities. However, some populations may possess genetic variation that allows for local adaption to high elevation. A plain language summary is available for this article. © 2019 The Authors.

Here, we used a hierarchical Q ST –F ST approach to separate the roles of adaptive and neutral processes in shaping phenotypic variation in moor frog (Rana arvalis) larval life histories along a 1,700 km latitudinal gradient across northern Europe. This species has colonized Scandinavia via two routes with a contact zone in northern Sweden. By using neutral SNP and common garden phenotypic data from 13 populations at two temperatures, we showed that most of the variation along the gradient occurred between the two colonizing lineages. We found little phenotypic divergence within the lineages; however, all phenotypic traits were strongly diverged between the southern and northern colonization routes, with higher growth and development rates and larger body size in the north. The Q ST estimates between the colonization routes were four times higher than F ST , indicating a prominent role for natural selection. Q ST within the colonization routes did not generally differ from F ST , but we found temperature-dependent adaptive divergence close to the contact zone.

"Habitat choice stabilizes metapopulation dynamics by enabling ecological specialization","10.1111/oik.05885","Mortier F., Jacob S., Vandegehuchte M.L., Bonte D.","Dispersal is a key trait responsible for the spread of individuals and genes among local populations, thereby generating eco-evolutionary interactions. Especially in heterogeneous metapopulations, a tight coupling between dispersal, population dynamics and the evolution of local adaptation is expected. In this respect, dispersal should counteract ecological specialization by redistributing locally selected phenotypes (i.e. migration load). Habitat choice following an informed dispersal decision, however, can facilitate the evolution of ecological specialization. How such informed decisions influence metapopulation size and variability is yet to be determined. By means of individual-based modelling, we demonstrate that informed decisions about both departure and settlement decouple the evolution of dispersal and that of generalism, selecting for highly dispersive specialists. Choice at settlement is based on information from the entire dispersal range, and therefore decouples dispersal from ecological specialization more effectively than choice at departure, which is only based on local information. Additionally, habitat choice at departure and settlement reduces local and metapopulation variability because of the maintenance of ecological specialization at all levels of dispersal propensity. Our study illustrates the important role of habitat choice for dynamics of spatially structured populations and thus emphasizes the importance of considering that dispersal is often informed. © 2018 The Authors",2019,"dispersal; eco-evolutionary dynamics; local adaptation; spatial ecology","Article","SCOPUS"

When low population densities translate into low mate encounter rates, this should result in reduced mate choosiness. In a system with overall high mating costs for males (due to precopulatory mate guarding, called amplexus), we investigated amplexus re-establishment after separating mating pairs and presenting focal males with a novel, size-matched female. Male Gammarus roeselii from a low-density (LD) population spent significantly less time until amplexus re-establishment than males from a high-density (HD) site, suggesting reduced choosiness in LD males. We experimentally ruled out alternative explanations such as differences in locomotor activity or mate finding abilities. To further demonstrate independent evolutionary trajectories of our study populations, we examined divergence in morphology and found males to differ in several traits involved in mate assessment and mate guarding. Together, we report phenotypic divergence in behavioural and morphological traits that is probably driven by contrasting selective regimes arising from different population densities.

Cichlid fish species in Lake Victoria are a prime example of recent speciation events and a suitable system to study the adaptation and reproductive isolation of species. Results: Here, we report the pattern of genomic differentiation between two Lake Victoria cichlid species collected in sympatry, Haplochromis pyrrhocephalus and H. sp. ‘macula,’ based on the pooled genome sequences of 20 individuals of each species. Despite their ecological differences, population genomics analyses demonstrate that the two species are very close to a single panmictic population due to extensive gene flow. However, we identified 21 highly differentiated short genomic regions with fixed nucleotide differences. At least 15 of these regions contained genes with predicted roles in adaptation and reproductive isolation, such as visual adaptation, circadian clock, developmental processes, adaptation to hypoxia, and sexual selection. The nonsynonymous fixed differences in one of these genes, LWS, were reported as substitutions causing shift in absorption spectra of LWS pigments. Fixed differences were found in the promoter regions of four other differentially expressed genes, indicating that these substitutions may alter gene expression levels. Conclusions: These diverged short genomic regions may have contributed to the differentiation of two ecologically different species. Moreover, the origins of adaptive variants within the differentiated regions predate the geological formation of Lake Victoria; thus Lake Victoria cichlid species diversified via selection on standing genetic variation. © 2019 The Author(s).",2019,"adaptation; cichlids; genomic islands of speciation; population genomics; speciation","Article","SCOPUS"

Climate change poses an additional challenge and exacerbates existing vulnerabilities affecting cities and its people, especially the urban poor. This paper highlights the barriers and enablers to climate change-related adaptation experienced in some of Bengaluru’s informal settlements. The barriers described in the paper include economic, social, governance and information related issues that impede local actions and increase vulnerabilities. Enabling factors such as improving social and human capital, gaining formal recognition and most importantly support from agencies (e.g. local government, civil societies, and community leaders), help overcome some of the barriers or challenges. Hence, local level adaptation measures mainstreamed with local developmental agendas help address some of the structural causes of vulnerability.

"The role of structural genomic variants in population differentiation and ecotype formation in Timema cristinae walking sticks","10.1111/mec.15016","Lucek K., Gompert Z., Nosil P.","Theory predicts that structural genomic variants such as inversions can promote adaptive diversification and speciation. Despite increasing empirical evidence that adaptive divergence can be triggered by one or a few large inversions, the degree to which widespread genomic regions under divergent selection are associated with structural variants remains unclear. Here we test for an association between structural variants and genomic regions that underlie parallel host-plant-associated ecotype formation in Timema cristinae stick insects. Using mate-pair resequencing of 20 new whole genomes we find that moderately sized structural variants such as inversions, deletions and duplications are widespread across the genome, being retained as standing variation within and among populations. Using 160 previously published, standard-orientation whole genome sequences we find little to no evidence that the DNA sequences within inversions exhibit accentuated differentiation between ecotypes. In contrast, a formerly described large region of reduced recombination that harbours genes controlling colour-pattern exhibits evidence for accentuated differentiation between ecotypes, which is consistent with differences in the frequency of colour-pattern morphs between host-associated ecotypes. Our results suggest that some types of structural variants (e.g., large inversions) are more likely to underlie adaptive divergence than others, and that structural variants are not required for subtle yet genome-wide genetic differentiation with gene flow. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",2019,"adaptation; ecological genetics; insects; population genetics - empirical","Article","SCOPUS"

Following 60 generations of evolution in large population sizes with competition for food resources, two distinct classes of lines representing different degrees of adaptive response emerged: a low-fitness class that exhibited minimal or no improvement compared to the gas-1 mutant ancestor, and a high-fitness class containing lines that exhibited partial recovery of wild-type fitness. Many lines that achieved higher reproductive and competitive fitness levels were also noted to evolve high frequencies of males during the experiment, consistent with adaptation in these lines having been facilitated by outcrossing. Whole-genome sequencing and analysis revealed an enrichment of mutations in loci that occur in a gas-1-centric region of the C. elegans interactome and could be classified into a small number of functional genomic categories. A highly nonrandom pattern of mitochondrial DNA mutation was observed within high-fitness gas-1 lines, with parallel fixations of nonsynonymous base substitutions within genes encoding NADH dehydrogenase subunits I and VI.

"Indirect interactions shape selection in a multispecies food web","10.1086/701785","Start D., Weis A.E., Gilbert B.","Species do not live, interact, or evolve in isolation but are instead members of complex ecological communities. In ecological terms, complex multispecies interactions can be understood by considering indirect effects that are mediated by changes in traits and abundances of intermediate species. Interestingly, traits and abundances are also central to our understanding of phenotypic selection, suggesting that indirect effects may be extended to understand evolution in complex communities. Here we explore indirect ecological effects and their evolutionary corollary in a well-understood food web comprising a plant, its herbivores, and enemies that select for opposite defensive phenotypes in one of the herbivores. We show that ecological indirect interactions are mediated by changes to both the traits and the abundances of intermediate species and that these changes ultimately reduce enemy attack and weaken selection. We discuss the generality of the link between indirect effects and selection. We go on to argue that local adaptation and eco-evolutionary feedback may be less likely in complex multispecies food webs than in simpler food chains (e.g., coevolution).

Atlantic salmon are usually characterized by population structure at multiple spatial scales; however, this is not the case for tributaries of the Miramichi River in North America. To resolve genetic relationships between populations in this system and the potential for known chromosomal fusions to contribute to adaptation, we genotyped 728 juvenile salmon using a 50 K SNP array. Consistent with previous work, we report extremely weak overall population structuring (Global F ST  = 0.004) and failed to support hierarchical structure between the river's two main branches. We provide the first genomic characterization of a previously described polymorphic fusion between chromosomes 8 and 29. Fusion genomic characteristics included high LD, reduced heterozygosity in the fused homokaryotes, and strong divergence between the fused and the unfused rearrangement. Population structure based on fusion karyotype was five times stronger than neutral variation (F ST  = 0.019), and the frequency of the fusion was associated with summer precipitation supporting a hypothesis that this rearrangement may contribute local adaptation despite weak neutral differentiation. Additionally, both outlier variation among populations and a polygenic framework for characterizing adaptive variation in relation to climate identified a 250-Kb region of chromosome 9, including the gene six6 that has previously been linked to age-at-maturity and run-timing for this species. Overall, our results indicate that adaptive processes, independent of major river branching, are more important than neutral processes for structuring these populations. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",2019,"atlantic salmon; chromosomal fusion; local adaptation; six6; structural variation","Article","SCOPUS"

Such waters have been demonstrated to affect adaptation and gene flow of the aquatic fauna. However, this classification focuses on large rivers and fails to acknowledge the importance of small forest streams that flow through upland terra firme forests, known as igarapés. Igarapés are surrounded by a distinct floristic composition when compared to the floodplains and contribute with a much greater water load to the Amazon basin than the Amazon River itself. We assessed the importance of blackwater, whitewater, and igarapé water on spawning and habitat choice in Crenuchus spilurus, a small fish composed of distinct genetic lineages that occur in igarapés flowing to blackwater and whitewater systems. Lineages from igarapés connected to the Rio Negro (blackwater) and Amazon River (whitewater) basins have greater spawning success in igarapé water than in the water from their surrounding floodplain. Habitat choice trials showed active selection of igarapé water by both lineages.

Results of empirical studies examining the role of gene flow in an adaptive context, however, have largely been equivocal, with examples of opposing outcomes being repeatedly documented (e.g., local adaptation with high levels of gene flow vs. gene swamping). We compared neutral genomic and venom expression divergence for three sympatric pit vipers with differing ecologies to determine if and how migration-selection disequilibria result in local adaptation. We specifically tested whether neutral differentiation predicted phenotypic differentiation within an isolation-by-distance framework. The decoupling of neutral and phenotypic differentiation would indicate selection led to adaptive divergence irrespective of migration, whereas a significant relationship between neutral and venom expression differentiation would provide evidence in favor of the constraining force of gene flow. Neutral differentiation and geographic distance predicted phenotypic differentiation only in the generalist species, indicating that selection was the predominant mechanism in the migration-selection balance underlying adaptive venom evolution in both specialists. Dispersal is thought to be a stronger influence on genetic differentiation than specialization, but our results suggest the opposite. Greater specialization may lead to greater diversification rates, and extreme spatial and temporal variation in selective pressures can favor generalist phenotypes evolving under strong stabilizing selection. Our results are consistent with these expectations, suggesting that the equivocal findings of studies examining the role of gene flow in an adaptive context may be explained by ecological specialization theory. © The Author(s) 2018.

The species was sampled across 12 central and range-edge populations (192 samples), and strong genetic structure was apparent, as were high inbreeding coefficients. Populations showed differences in genetic diversity, and one population lost significant genetic diversity in a decade. More than 500 SNP loci were putatively under directional selection, and 413 of these loci were correlated with environmental variables such as temperature, rainfall, evaporation and soil moisture. One locus showed homology to a gene involved in the activation of maturation in Xenopus oocytes, which may facilitate rapid development of embryos in drier climates.

Three-spine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) are an excellent model for such studies, as they have repeatedly adapted to divergent habitats across the Northern hemisphere. Here, we use genomic, ecological and morphological data from 16 independent pairs of stickleback populations adapted to divergent lake and stream habitats. We combine a population genomic approach to identify regions of the genome that are likely under selection in these divergent habitats with an association mapping approach to identify regions of the genome that underlie variation in ecological factors and morphological traits. Over 37% of genomic windows are repeatedly differentiated across lake-stream pairs. Similarly, many genomic windows are associated with variation in abiotic factors, diet items and morphological phenotypes. Both the highly differentiated windows and candidate trait windows are non-randomly distributed across the genome and show some overlap. However, the overlap is not significant on a genome-wide scale.

"Variation in the venom of parasitic wasps, drift, or selection? Insights from a multivariate QST analysis","10.3389/fevo.2019.156","Mathé-Hubert H., Kremmer L., Colinet D., Gatti J.-L., Van Baaren J., Delava É., Poirié M.","Differentiation of traits among populations can evolve by drift when gene flow is low relative to drift or selection when there are different local optima in each population (heterogeneous selection), whereas homogeneous selection tends to prevent evolution of such a differentiation. Analyses of geographical variations in venom composition have been done in several taxa such as wasps, spiders, scorpions, cone snails and snakes, but surprisingly never in parasitoid wasps, although their venom should constrain their ability to succeed on locally available hosts. Such a study is now facilitated by the development of an accurate method (quantitative digital analysis) that allows analyzing the quantitative variation of large sets of proteins from several individuals. This method was used here to analyse the venom-based differentiation of four samples of Leptopilina boulardi and five samples of L. heterotoma from populations along a 300 km long south-north gradient in the Rhône-Saône valley (South-East of France). A major result is that the composition of the venom allows to differentiate the populations studied even when separated by few kilometers. We further analyzed these differentiations on the populations (reared under similar conditions to exclude environmental variance) with a QST analysis which compared the variance of a quantitative trait (Q) among the subpopulations (S) to the total variance (T). We also used random forest clustering analyses to detect the venom components the most likely to be adapted locally. The signature of the natural selection was strong for L. heterotoma and L. boulardi. For the latter, the comparison with the differentiation observed at some neutral markers revealed that differentiation was partly due to some local adaptation. The combination of methods used here appears to be a powerful framework for population proteomics and for the study of eco-evolutionary feedbacks between proteomic level and population and ecosystem levels. This is of interest not only for studying field evolution at an intermediate level between the genome and phenotypes, or for understanding the role of evolution in chemical ecology, but also for more applied issues in biological control. © 2019 Mathé-Hubert, Kremmer, Colinet, Gatti, Van Baaren, Delava and Poirié.",2019,"adaptive divergence; antagonistic coevolution; drosophila; individual 1d sds-page; leptopilina wasps; local adaptation; multivariate qst; population proteomics","Article","SCOPUS"
"Cyclically parthenogenetic rotifers and the theories of population and evolutionary ecology [Los rotíferos partenogenéticos cíclicos y las teorías de ecologyía de poblaciones y evolutiva]","10.23818/limn.38.13","Serra M., García-Roger E.M., Ortells R., Carmona M.J.","Cyclically parthenogenetic rotifers are facultative sexual aquatic microinvertebrates that live in continental and coastal waters and attracted the scientific interest of Professor M. R. Miracle. Some of her early studies anticipated the use of these rotifers as model organisms to test hypotheses in population and evolutionary ecology. This short review is aimed to stress the research she initiated at the University of Valencia. With this aim in mind, we enumerate and comment on (1) the biological and ecological features of rotifers that make them remarkable model organisms and (2) the research fields influenced by rotifer population biology. Among the latter, we selected some topics in order to illustrate how rotifer studies have contributed to our knowledge: phenotypic plasticity, competition and coexistence among cryptic species, the evolution of sex and complex life cycles, and aging. We deeply review studies on rotifer ecological genetics and evolutionary ecology with an emphasis on population studies conducted in eastern Spain and fostered by Professor Miracle. We conclude that rotifer populations harbor high local genetic diversity, with the occurrence of clonal selection during the planktonic growing season. Moreover, studies show that they have high population differentiation, which holds signatures of historical events (e.g., glacial refugia and posterior range expansion). Additionally, differential local adaptation occurs even among neighboring populations. Two remarkable conclusions are that (1) population differentiation in rotifers is most likely due to persistent founder effects rather than to “isolation by adaptation” and (2) rotifer populations can differentially adapt to the levels of environmental uncertainty in their respective localities. This occurs by adjusting the timing of sex and initiating sex and diapausing egg production earlier when populations inhabit localities with higher uncertainty. Related to environmental uncertainty but also to other environmental features (novel environments where recombination is needed to fuel natural selection, nutrient availability, etc.), experimental evolution studies have found that laboratory populations evolve quickly, allowing them to become easily adapted to new conditions. We suggest that rotifers should be used in the close future to address additional central hypotheses in evolutionary ecology as a result of the feasibility of experimental evolution and resurrection ecology on one hand and “omics” tools on the other hand. As specific topics for future research, we highlight the evolution of sex, speciation, eco-evolutionary dynamics and the regulation of complex life cycles in relation to environmental cues. © Asociación Ibérica de Limnología, Madrid.

"Genomic analysis reveals multiple mismatches between biological and management units in yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares)","10.1093/icesjms/fsy102","Mullins R.B., McKeown N.J., Sauer W.H.H., Shaw P.W., Grant W.S.","The South African (SAF) yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) fishery represents a potential example of misalignment between management units and biological processes. The SAF fishery spans an operational stock with a boundary at 20°E, either side of which fish are considered part of Atlantic or Indian Ocean regional stocks. However, the actual recruitment of fish from Atlantic and Indian Ocean spawning populations into SAF waters is unknown. To address this knowledge gap, genomic analysis (11 101 SNPs) was performed on samples from Atlantic and Indian Ocean spawning sites, including SAF sites spanning the current stock boundary. Outlier loci conferred high discriminatory power to assignment tests and revealed that all SAF fish were assigned to the Indian Ocean population and that no Atlantic Ocean fish appeared in the SAF samples. Additionally, several Indian Ocean migrants were detected at the Atlantic spawning site demonstrating asymmetric dispersal and the occurrence of a mixed-stock fishery in Atlantic waters. This study highlights both the spatial inaccuracy of current stock designations and a misunderstanding of interactions between the underlying biological units, which must be addressed in light of local and global declines of the species. Specifically, the entire SAF fishery must be managed as part of the Indian Ocean stock. © 2018 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.",2018,"adaptation; assignment; conservation; dispersal; genetic differentiation; stock; sustainability","Article","SCOPUS"

Genetic differentiation and/or local adaptation among populations are sometimes observed at small spatial scales. The marbled flounder (Pseudopleuronectes yokohamae) is a commercially important coastal species in Tokyo Bay, Central Japan, exhibiting different spawning phenology at a small scale. Using 30 highly polymorphic microsatellite loci, including the 16 new microsatellite loci developed in the present study, we estimated the genetic structure and demographic connectivity of specimens collected along Tokyo Bay in 2012–2013 and 2015–2016. F-statistics indicated a genetic differentiation between adult populations collected within and outside Tokyo Bay during both collection periods, but almost no difference was detected between the populations from the inner and outer parts of Tokyo Bay. Assignment tests directly estimated demographic connectivity between the inner and outer bays via larval dispersal and juvenile and adult migration. The average movement distance of marbled flounder was 13.1–29.6 km, with a maximum distance of 42.8–54.0 km. This movement distance contributed to the strong demographic connectivity between the inner and outer bays. Meanwhile, an indirect method using the isolation by distance (IBD) theory underestimated the average movement distance (5.0–7.8 km) because the isolated setting of Tokyo Bay resulted in a higher IBD slope. Based on the results of F-statistics and assignment tests, we suggest that a multilayered management by local and regional organizations may benefit the fishery in Tokyo Bay. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",2018,"assignment test; flatfish; isolation by distance; larval dispersal; migration; movement distance","Article","SCOPUS"
"Population genomics of Fundulus grandis exposed to oil from Deepwater Horizon","10.1016/j.jembe.2018.09.003","Schaefer J., Kreiser B., Flanagan S.","The April 2010 Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill released over 4 million barrels of oil into northern Gulf of Mexico ecosystems. Due to the magnitude of the spill and observed effects from previous spills, the ecological impacts were predicted to be catastrophic. While negative effects of petroleum hydrocarbon exposure to fish have been documented at the organismal scale, most studies of fish assemblages have noted few, if any, DWH impacts. Our understanding of DWH effects is therefore limited by a disconnect in results reported at different organizational levels. We used population genomic tools to test hypotheses about population-level DWH impacts to Gulf Killifish (Fundulus grandis) in coastal Mississippi. Fundulus grandis is one of the most abundant marsh species in the northern Gulf of Mexico, and along with the sister species F. heteroclitus, has served as a model for toxicology research. We collected genotyping by sequencing data from four populations of F. grandis (two oiled and two not) to test predictions about DWH-related gene flow, demographics, genetic diversity and evidence of selection. Mississippi populations of F. grandis showed clear genetic structure, but there were few indicators (e.g. reduced genetic diversity, lower Ne estimates) consistent with large-scale mortality or migration related to DWH oil. Only one estimate of effective population size was reduced in oil-exposed populations and of the twenty outlier loci only two were in regions with potential adaptive significance (i.e., immune functions). While the toxic effects of oil on F. grandis at the organismal level is well established, the minimal impacts we detected to populations along the Mississippi coast likely reflects the complexity of the northern Gulf of Mexico and DWH oil spill. However, we do recognize that the patchiness of oil exposure and low genome coverage of the data limit our ability to conclude there were no DWH effects on these populations. © 2018",2018,"demographics; fish; gulf of mexico; outlier loci analysis; population structure","Article","SCOPUS"
"Genomics and conservation units: The genetic basis of adult migration timing in Pacific salmonids","10.1111/eva.12687","Waples R.S., Lindley S.T.","It is now routinely possible to generate genomics-scale datasets for nonmodel species; however, many questions remain about how best to use these data for conservation and management. Some recent genomics studies of anadromous Pacific salmonids have reported a strong association between alleles at one or a very few genes and a key life history trait (adult migration timing) that has played an important role in defining conservation units. Publication of these results has already spurred a legal challenge to the existing framework for managing these species, which was developed under the paradigm that most phenotypic traits are controlled by many genes of small effect, and that parallel evolution of life history traits is common. But what if a key life history trait can only be expressed if a specific allele is present? Does the current framework need to be modified to account for the new genomics results, as some now propose? Although this real-world example focuses on Pacific salmonids, the issues regarding how genomics can inform us about the genetic basis of phenotypic traits, and what that means for applied conservation, are much more general. In this perspective, we consider these issues and outline a general process that can be used to help generate the types of additional information that would be needed to make informed decisions about the adequacy of existing conservation and management frameworks.

"Local prey community composition and genetic distance predict venom divergence among populations of the northern Pacific rattlesnake (Crotalus oreganus)","10.1111/jeb.13347","Holding M.L., Margres M.J., Rokyta D.R., Gibbs H.L.","Identifying the environmental correlates of divergence in functional traits between populations can provide insights into the evolutionary mechanisms that generate local adaptation. Here, we assess patterns of population differentiation in expressed venom proteins in Northern Pacific rattlesnakes (Crotalus oreganus) from 13 locations across California. We evaluate the relative importance of major biotic (prey species community composition), abiotic (temperature, precipitation and elevation) and genetic factors (genetic distance based on RAD-seq loci) as correlates of population divergence in venom phenotypes. We found that over half of the variation in venom composition is associated with among-population differentiation for genetic and environmental variables and that this variation occurred along axes defining previously observed functional trade-offs between venom proteins that have neurotoxic, myotoxic and hemorrhagic effects. Surprisingly, genetic differentiation among populations was the best predictor of venom divergence, accounting for 46% of overall variation, whereas differences in prey community composition and abiotic factors explained smaller amounts of variation (23% and 19%, respectively). The association between genetic differentiation and venom composition could be due to an isolation-by-distance effect or, more likely, an isolation-by-environment effect where selection against recent migrants is strong, producing a correlation between neutral genetic differentiation and venom differentiation. Our findings suggest that even coarse estimates of prey community composition can be useful in understanding the selection pressures acting on patterns of venom protein expression. Additionally, our results suggest that factors other than adaptation to spatial variation in prey need to be considered when explaining population divergence in venom. © 2018 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

Annual catches in commercial fisheries are in serious decline, which has resulted in calls for the development of an integrated stock management approach. In Oman, the scalloped spiny lobster is currently treated as a single management unit (MU) or stock and there is an absence of information on the genetic population structure of the species that can inform management decisions, particularly at a fine-scale level. This work is the first to identify genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for P. homarus using Diversity Arrays Technology sequencing (DArT-seq) and to elucidate any stock structure in the species. Results: After stringent filtering, 7988 high utility SNPs were discovered and used to assess the genetic diversity, connectivity and structure of P. homarus populations from Al Ashkharah, Masirah Island, Duqm, Ras Madrakah, Haitam, Ashuwaymiyah, Mirbat and Dhalkut landing sites. Pairwise F ST estimates revealed low differentiation among populations (pairwise F ST range = - 0.0008 - 0.0021). Analysis of genetic variation using putatively directional F ST outliers (504 SNPs) revealed higher and significant pairwise differentiation (p &lt; 0.01) for all locations, with Ashuwaymiyah being the most diverged population (Ashuwaymiyah pairwise F ST range = 0.0288-0.0736). Analysis of population structure using Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC) revealed a broad admixture among P. homarus, however, Ashuwaymiyah stock appeared to be potentially under local adaptive pressures. Fine scale analysis using Netview R provided further support for the general admixture of P. homarus. Conclusions: Findings here suggested that stocks of P. homarus along the Omani coastline are admixed. Yet, fishery managers need to treat the lobster stock from Ashuwaymiyah with caution as it might be subject to local adaptive pressures. We emphasize further study with larger number of samples to confirm the genetic status of the Ashuwaymiyah stock.

Variation in maturation timing occurs in steelhead trout, which has been associated with greb1L, an oestrogen target gene. Previous techniques that identified this gene only accounted for about 0.5-2.0% of the genome and solely investigated coastal populations, leaving uncertainty on the genetic basis of this trait and its prevalence across a larger geographic scale. Results: We used a three-tiered approach to interrogate the genomic basis of complex phenology in anadromous steelhead. First, fine scale mapping with 5.3 million SNPs from resequencing data covering 68% of the genome confirmed a 309-kb region consisting of four genes on chromosome 28, including greb1L, to be the genomic region of major effect for maturation timing. Second, broad-scale characterization of candidate greb1L genotypes across 59 populations revealed unexpected patterns in maturation phenology for inland fish migrating long distances relative to those in coastal streams. Finally, genotypes from 890 PIT-tag tracked steelhead determined associations with early versus late arrival to spawning grounds that were previously unknown. Conclusions: This study clarifies the genetic bases for disparity in phenology observed in steelhead, determining an unanticipated trait association with premature versus mature arrival to spawning grounds and identifying multiple candidate genes potentially contributing to this variation from a single genomic region of major effect. This illustrates how dense genome mapping and detailed phenotypic characterization can clarify genotype to phenotype associations across geographic ranges of species. © 2018 The Author(s).",2018,"adaptation; genome evolution; greb1l; migration; oncorhynchus; pooled sequencing; sexual maturation","Article","SCOPUS"

For species inhabiting complex spatial environments however, it is unclear how the balance between gene flow and selection may be influenced by landscape heterogeneity and environmental variation. Here, we evaluated the effects of dendritic landscape structure and the selective forces of hydroclimatic variation on population genomic parameters for the Murray River rainbowfish, Melanotaenia fluviatilis across the Murray–Darling Basin, Australia. We genotyped 249 rainbowfish at 17,503 high-quality SNP loci and integrated these with models of network connectivity and high-resolution environmental data within a riverscape genomics framework. We tested competing models of gene flow before using multivariate genotype–environment association (GEA) analysis to test for signals of adaptive divergence associated with hydroclimatic variation. Patterns of neutral genetic variation were consistent with expectations based on the stream hierarchy model and M. fluviatilis’ moderate dispersal ability. Models incorporating dendritic network structure suggested that landscape heterogeneity is a more important factor determining connectivity and gene flow than waterway distance. Extending these results, we also introduce a novel approach to controlling for the unique effects of dendritic network structure in GEA analyses of populations of aquatic species. We identified 146 candidate loci potentially underlying a polygenic adaptive response to seasonal fluctuations in stream flow and variation in the relative timing of temperature and precipitation extremes. Our findings underscore an emerging predominant role for seasonal variation in hydroclimatic conditions driving local adaptation and are relevant for informing proactive conservation management. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",2018,"climate change; ddrad-seq; dendritic networks; landscape genomics; melanotaenia fluviatilis; murray-darling basin","Article","SCOPUS"
"Fishing in troubled waters: Revealing genomic signatures of local adaptation in response to freshwater pollutants in two macroinvertebrates","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.03.109","Weigand H., Weiss M., Cai H., Li Y., Yu L., Zhang C., Leese F.","Local adaptation is of fundamental importance for populations to cope with fast, human-mediated environmental changes. In the past, analyses of local adaptation were restricted to few model species. Nowadays, due to the increased affordability of high-throughput sequencing, local adaptation can be studied much easier by searching for patterns of positive selection using genomic data. In the present study, we analysed effects of wastewater treatment plant and ore mining effluents on stream invertebrate populations. The two different anthropogenic stressors have impacted on stream ecosystems over different time scales and with different potencies. As target organisms we selected two macroinvertebrate species with different life histories and dispersal capacities: the caddisfly Glossosoma conformis and the flatworm Dugesia gonocephala. We applied a genome-wide genetic marker technique, termed ddRAD (double digest restriction site associated DNA) sequencing, to identify local adaptation. Ten and 18% of all loci were identified as candidate loci for local adaptation in D. gonocephala and G. conformis, respectively. However, after stringent re-evaluation of the genomic data, strong evidence for local adaptation remained only for one population of the flatworm D. gonocephala affected by high copper concentration from ore mining. One of the corresponding candidate loci is arnt, a gene associated with the response to xenobiotics and potentially involved in metal detoxification. Our results support the hypotheses that local adaptation is more likely to play a central role in environments impacted by a stronger stressor for a longer time and that it is more likely to occur in species with lower migration rates. However, these findings have to be interpreted cautiously, as several confounding factors may have limited the possibility to detect local adaptation. Our study highlights how genomic tools can be used to study the adaptability and thus resistance of natural populations to changing environments and we discuss prospects and limitations of the methods. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",2018,"metal mining; population genomics; positive selection; wastewater treatment plants","Article","SCOPUS"
"Fine-scale genetic structure of the European bitterling at the intersection of three major European watersheds","10.1186/s12862-018-1219-9","Bartáková V., Bryja J., Reichard M.","Background: Anthropogenic factors can have a major impact on the contemporary distribution of intraspecific genetic diversity. Many freshwater fishes have finely structured and locally adapted populations, but their natural genetic structure can be affected by river engineering schemes across river basins, fish transfers in aquaculture industry and conservation management. The European bitterling (Rhodeus amarus) is a small fish that is a brood parasite of freshwater mussels and is widespread across continental Europe. Its range recently expanded, following sharp declines in the 1970s and 1980s. We investigated its genetic variability and spatial structure at the centre of its distribution at the boundary of three watersheds, testing the role of natural and anthropogenic factors in its genetic structure. Results: Sequences of mitochondrial cytochrome B (CYTB) revealed that bitterling colonised central Europe from two Ponto-Caspian refugia, which partly defines its contemporary genetic structure. Twelve polymorphic microsatellite loci revealed pronounced interpopulation differentiation, with significant small-scale differentiation within the same river basins. At a large scale, populations from the Baltic Sea watershed (middle Oder and Vistula basins) were distinct from those from the Black Sea watershed (Danube basin), while populations from rivers of the North Sea watershed (Rhine, Elbe) originated from the admixture of both original sources. Notable exceptions demonstrated the potential role of human translocations across watersheds, with the upper River Oder (Baltic watershed) inhabited by fish from the Danube basin (Black Sea watershed) and a population in the southern part of the River Elbe (North Sea watershed) basin possessing a signal of admixture from the Danube basin. Conclusions: Hydrography and physical barriers to dispersal are only partly reflected in the genetic structure of the European bitterling at the intersection of three major watersheds in central Europe. Drainage boundaries have been obscured by human-mediated translocations, likely related to common carp, Cyprinus carpio, cultivation and game-fish management. Despite these translocations, populations of bitterling are significantly structured by genetic drift, possibly reinforced by its low dispersal ability. Overall, the impact of anthropogenic factors on the genetic structure of the bitterling populations in central Europe is limited. © 2018 The Author(s).",2018,"cryptic invasions; freshwater conservation; game fish stocking; gene flow; human-mediated translocation; phylogeography; population genetics","Article","SCOPUS"

A previous study on the southern Japanese islands demonstrated that relative limb lengths of sika deer (Cervus nippon) were short on islands with steep slopes. We hypothesized that this morphological variation was evidence for local adaptation, and tested this hypothesis by comparing phenotypic divergence with neutral genetic divergence among eight populations of the sika deer in the southern Japanese islands. Divergence patterns differed between the phenotypic and neutral genetic features. Genetic similarity was high among individuals on Kyushu (OI, KGS, and KGK). Individuals on Tanegashima (TN) and Yakushima (YK) also constituted a group, whereas individuals on Tsushima (TS), Wakamatsujima (WM), and Kuchinoerabujima (KE) formed a genetically distinct group. Phenotypic data indicated that individuals from TS, OI, KGS, and KGK exhibited similarity, whereas individuals on YK formed an isolated group that was separated from the other populations. The degree of phenotypic divergence was larger than that of neutral genetic divergence between TN and YK. These results suggest that divergent selection worked between two of the eight island populations (TN and YK). The morphological trait of captive-bred individuals from TN and YK, which had never experienced their original environments, retained their original morphological features. By combining the results of multiple analyses, we found that the difference in relative limb length between the two populations was consistent with local adaptation hypothesis, although conclusive results were not obtained for the other populations. © 2018, The Society of Population Ecology and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.",2018,"adaptive evolution; captive-bred animals; genetic drift; morphological differentiation","Article","SCOPUS"

In this study, we used a dense SNP array to identify candidate loci potentially underlying fine-scale local adaptation within a large Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) population. By combining outlier, gene-environment association and haplotype homozygosity analyses, we identified multiple regions of the genome with strong evidence for diversifying selection. Several of these candidate regions had previously been identified in other studies, demonstrating that the same loci could be adaptively important in Atlantic salmon at subdrainage, regional and continental scales. Notably, we identified signals consistent with local selection around genes associated with variation in sexual maturation, energy homeostasis and immune defence. These included the large-effect ageat- maturity gene vgll3, the known obesity gene mc4r, and major histocompatibility complex II. Most strikingly, we confirmed a genomic region on Ssa09 that was extremely differentiated among subpopulations and that is also a candidate for local selection over the global range of Atlantic salmon. This region colocalized with a haplotype strongly associated with spawning ecotype in sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), with circumstantial evidence that the same gene (six6) may be the selective target in both cases. The phenotypic effect of this region in Atlantic salmon remains cryptic, although allelic variation is related to upstream catchment area and covaries with timing of the return spawning migration.

Dispersal provides connections within metapopulations, promoting demographic and evolutionary rescue, but may also introduce maladapted individuals, potentially lowering the fitness of recipient populations through introgression of heritable traits. To explore this dual nature of dispersal, we modify a well-established eco-evolutionary model of two locally adapted populations and their associated mean trait values, to examine recruiting salmon populations that are connected by density-dependent dispersal, consistent with collective migratory behaviour that promotes navigation. When the strength of collective behaviour is weak such that straying is effectively constant, we show that a low level of straying is associated with the highest gains in metapopulation robustness and that high straying serves to erode robustness. Moreover, we find that as the strength of collective behaviour increases, metapopulation robustness is enhanced, but this relationship depends on the rate at which individuals stray. Specifically, strong collective behaviour increases the presence of hidden low-density basins of attraction, which may serve to trap disturbed populations, and this is exacerbated by increased habitat heterogeneity. Taken as a whole, our findings suggest that density-dependent straying and collective migratory behaviour may help metapopulations, such as in salmon, thrive in dynamic landscapes. Given the pervasive eco-evolutionary impacts of dispersal on metapopulations, these findings have important ramifications for the conservation of salmon metapopulations facing both natural and anthropogenic contemporary disturbances. © 2018 The Authors.",2018,"alternative stable states; dispersal; eco-evolutionary dynamics; salmon metapopulations; straying","Article","SCOPUS"

Separating signatures of clinal adaptation from signatures of other evolutionary forces, such as demographic processes, genetic drift and adaptation, to nonclinal conditions of the immediate local environment is a major challenge. Here, we examine climate adaptation in five natural populations of the harlequin fly Chironomus riparius sampled along a climatic gradient across Europe. Our study integrates experimental data, individual genome resequencing, Pool-Seq data and population genetic modelling. Common-garden experiments revealed significantly different population growth rates at test temperatures corresponding to the population origin along the climate gradient, suggesting thermal adaptation on the phenotypic level. Based on a population genomic analysis, we derived empirical estimates of historical demography and migration. We used an FST outlier approach to infer positive selection across the climate gradient, in combination with an environmental association analysis. In total, we identified 162 candidate genes as genomic basis of climate adaptation. Enriched functions among these candidate genes involved the apoptotic process and molecular response to heat, as well as functions identified in studies of climate adaptation in other insects. Our results show that local climate conditions impose strong selection pressures and lead to genomic adaptation despite strong gene flow. Moreover, these results imply that selection to different climatic conditions seems to converge on a functional level, at least between different insect species. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",2018,"diptera; latent factor mixed model; multiple sequential markovian coalescence; population divergence; temperature; thermal selection","Article","SCOPUS"
"Founder effects drive the genetic structure of passively dispersed aquatic invertebrates","10.7717/peerj.6094","Montero-Pau J., Gómez A., Serra M.","Populations of passively dispersed organisms in continental aquatic habitats typically show high levels of neutral genetic differentiation despite their high dispersal capabilities. Several evolutionary factors, including founder events, local adaptation, and life cycle features such as high population growth rates and the presence of propagule banks, have been proposed to be responsible for this paradox. Here, we have modeled the colonization process to assess the impact of migration rate, population growth rate, population size, local adaptation and life-cycle features on the population genetic structure in these organisms. Our simulations show that the strongest effect on population structure are persistent founder effects, resulting from the interaction of a few population founders, high population growth rates, large population sizes and the presence of diapausing egg banks. In contrast, the role of local adaptation, genetic hitchhiking and migration is limited to small populations in these organisms. Our results indicate that local adaptation could have different impact on genetic structure in different groups of zooplankters. © Copyright 2018 Montero-Pau et al.",2018,"cladocera; genetic differentiation; local adaptation; migration; rotifera; zooplankton","Article","SCOPUS"

Here, we used RAD-seq to study the recent evolutionary history of five fish species from Lake Hovsgol in Mongolia. This ancient lake was probably recolonized from its outlet following the Last Glacial Maximum, and harbours only ten native fish species. We detected substantial genetic differentiation between the lake and the putative ancestral refuge river in five species but we also found that these species have experienced different population dynamics. Some species appear to have colonized the lake after the Last Glacial Maximum, while others harbour levels of genetic differentiation consistent with the presence of refugia in the lake that could have persisted during glacial maxima or suggestive of colonization from a distinct source. We further demonstrated that fish species have experienced different levels of gene flow following colonization of the lake, suggesting that ecology and habitat use have had a substantial impact on the differentiation of lake populations. © 2018 The Linnean Society of London.",2018,"baikal ecoregion; fish communities; lake hovsgol; population genomics; rad-seq","Article","SCOPUS"

Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, numerous forest species are subject to severe population decline. Investigating variation in genetic diversity, phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation should be a prerequisite for implementing conservation actions. This study aimed to explore these aspects in ten fragmented populations of Physospermum cornubiense in view of translocation measures across its Italian range. Methods. For each population we collected environmental data on landscape (habitat size, quality and fragmentation) and local conditions (slope, presence of alien species, incidence of the herbivorous insect Metcalfa pruinosa and soil parameters). We measured vegetative and reproductive traits in the field and analysed the genetic population structure using ISSR markers (STRUCTURE and AMOVA). We then estimated the neutral (FST) and quantitative (PST) genetic differentiation of populations. Results. The populations exhibited moderate phenotypic variation. Population size (range: 16-655 individuals), number of flowering adults (range: 3-420 individuals) and inflorescence size (range: 5.0-8.4 cm) were positively related to Mg soil content. Populations' gene diversity was moderate (Nei-H = 0.071-0.1316); STRUCTURE analysis identified five different clusters and three main geographic groups: upper, lower, and Apennine/Western Po plain. Fragmentation did not have an influence on the local adaptation of populations, which for all measured traits showed PST &lt; FST, indicating convergent selection. Discussion. The variation of phenotypic traits across sites was attributed to plastic response rather than local adaptation. Plant translocation from suitable source populations to endangered ones should particularly take into account provenance according to identified genetic clusters and specific soil factors. © 2018 Gentili et al.",2018,"conservation genetics; evolutionary history; local adaptation; migration; natural selection; phenotypic plasticity; species reinforcement","Article","SCOPUS"
"Population transcriptomics in Daphnia: The role of thermal selection","10.1111/mec.14450","Herrmann M., Ravindran S.P., Schwenk K., Cordellier M.","The complex interplay of forces influencing genetic divergence among populations complicates the discovery of the genetic basis underlying local adaptation. Here, we utilized for the first time a combined reverse ecology and population transcriptomic approach to assess the contribution of thermal selection to population differentiation, thereby considering transcriptome-wide variation in both gene expression profiles and DNA sequences. We compared transcriptomes among four Daphnia galeata populations and identified transcripts potentially responding to local thermal selection based on an extensive literature search for candidate genes possibly under thermal selection in arthropods. Over-representation of temperature-relevant candidate genes among transcripts strongly contributing to sequence divergence among two populations indicates that local thermal selection acted on the coding sequence level. We identified a large number of transcripts, which may contribute to local thermal adaptation based on outlier tests and distinctive expression profiles. However, among these, temperature-relevant candidate genes were not over-represented compared to the global gene set, suggesting that thermal selection played a minor role in divergence among Daphnia populations. Interestingly, although the majority of genes contributing strongly to sequence divergence did not contribute strongly to divergence at the expression level and vice versa, the affected gene functions were largely consistent between the two data sets. This suggests that genetic and regulatory variation constitutes alternative routes for responses to natural selection. Our combined utilization of a population transcriptomics approach and literature-based identification of ecologically informative candidate genes represents a useful and powerful methodology with a wide range of applications in evolutionary biology. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",2018,"candidate gene approach; ecological genomics; enrichment analysis; local adaptation; rna-seq","Article","SCOPUS"

Allochronic differentiation refers to a particular situation where gene flow is primarily impeded by temporal isolation between early and late reproducers. This process has been suggested to occur in a large array of organisms, even though it is still overlooked in the literature. We here focused on a well-documented case of incipient allochronic speciation in the winter pine processionary moth Thaumetopoea pityocampa. This species typically reproduces in summer and larval development occurs throughout autumn and winter. A unique, phenologically shifted population (SP) was discovered in 1997 in Portugal. It was proved to be strongly differentiated from the sympatric “winter population” (WP), but its evolutionary history could only now be explored. We took advantage of the recent assembly of a draft genome and of the development of pan-genomic RAD-seq markers to decipher the demographic history of the differentiating populations and develop genome scans of adaptive differentiation. We showed that the SP diverged relatively recently, that is, few hundred years ago, and went through two successive bottlenecks followed by population size expansions, while the sympatric WP is currently experiencing a population decline. We identified outlier SNPs that were mapped onto the genome, but none were associated with the phenological shift or with subsequent adaptations. The strong genetic drift that occurred along the SP lineage certainly challenged our capacity to reveal functionally important loci. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",2018,"demographic inference; detection of selection; phenology; pine processionary moth; population genomics; rad-sequencing","Article","SCOPUS"

Studies show that the majority of coral populations will likely decline as temperatures continue to increase, although some previous species-distribution models predict that ubiquitous species, such as the primary reef-building coral species Porites lobata, will increase their distribution under projected climate change. These predictive models, however, assume that all individuals of a population are able to tolerate the entire range of environmental conditions within the species’ geographic range. The effects of genetic isolation and local adaptation are not considered in species-distribution models that assume genetically contiguous populations. We aim to determine the effects of genetic isolation and local adaptation in species-distribution modelling of the ubiquitous species P. lobata under three climate change scenarios by comparing contiguous and isolated subpopulations. Location: Indian and Pacific Oceans. Methods: We ran a novel species-distribution model for P. lobata, segregated as five geographically isolated regions across the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and examined the species response to three climate-change scenarios (i.e., A2, A1B and B1, most recently considered as Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5, 6.0, and 4.5 Wm−2) by the year 2100. Results: In contrast with previous homogeneous species-distribution models that predict a global expansion of P. lobata, (˜5 ± 1%), we predict major losses of suitable habitat for P. lobata in four of the five regions examined, particularly in the central Pacific Ocean (&gt;99% ± &lt;0.1% for all climate scenarios). Indeed, when geographic and genetic isolation were considered, our predictions suggested that P. lobata would lose between 50–52 ± 4% of its habitat, depending on the climate-change scenario, mainly in the Pacific Ocean. Main conclusions: Genetic isolation will likely play a major role in the persistence of coral species under climate change, and small isolated populations may be more vulnerable to climate change than populations in large, highly connected regions. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",2018,"climate; connectivity; corals; isolation; refuges; temperature","Article","SCOPUS"

Here we investigate the population genetic structure of the orchard pest peach fruit moth (PFM) Carposina sasakii (Lepidoptera: Carposinidae) in China, which shows distinct biological differences when characterized from different host plants. Genetic diversity and genetic structure were assessed among populations from seven plant hosts and nine regions using 19 microsatellite loci and a mitochondrial sequence. Results: Strong genetic differentiation was found among geographical populations representing distinct geographical regions, but not in host-associated populations collected from the same area. Mantel tests based on microsatellite loci indicated an association between genetic differentiation and geographical distance, and to a lesser extent environmental differentiation. Approximate Bayesian Computation analyses supported the scenario that PFM likely originated from a southern area and dispersed northwards before the last glacial maximum during the Quaternary. Conclusions: Our analyses suggested a strong impact of geographical barriers and historical events rather than host plants on the genetic structure of the PFM; however, uncharacterized environmental factors and host plants may also play a role.

"Distinguishing among modes of convergent adaptation using population genomic data","10.1534/genetics.117.300417","Lee K.M., Coop G.","Geographically separated populations can convergently adapt to the same selection pressure. Convergent evolution at the level of a gene may arise via three distinct modes. The selected alleles can (1) have multiple independent mutational origins, (2) be shared due to shared ancestral standing variation, or (3) spread throughout subpopulations via gene flow. We present a model-based, statistical approach that utilizes genomic data to detect cases of convergent adaptation at the genetic level, identify the loci involved and distinguish among these modes. To understand the impact of convergent positive selection on neutral diversity at linked loci, we make use of the fact that hitchhiking can be modeled as an increase in the variance in neutral allele frequencies around a selected site within a population. We build on coalescent theory to show how shared hitchhiking events between subpopulations act to increase covariance in allele frequencies between subpopulations at loci near the selected site, and extend this theory under different models of migration and selection on the same standing variation. We incorporate this hitchhiking effect into a multivariate normal model of allele frequencies that also accounts for population structure. Based on this theory, we present a composite-likelihood-based approach that utilizes genomic data to identify loci involved in convergence, and distinguishes among alternate modes of convergent adaptation. We illustrate our method on genome-wide polymorphism data from two distinct cases of convergent adaptation. First, we investigate the adaptation for copper toxicity tolerance in two populations of the common yellow monkey flower, Mimulus guttatus. We show that selection has occurred on an allele that has been standing in these populations prior to the onset of copper mining in this region. Lastly, we apply our method to data from four populations of the killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus, that show very rapid convergent adaptation for tolerance to industrial pollutants. Here, we identify a single locus at which both independent mutation events and selection on an allele shared via gene flow, either slightly before or during selection, play a role in adaptation across the species’ range. © 2017 by the Genetics Society of America.",2017,"coalescent theory; composite likelihood; convergent adaptation; genetic hitchhiking; positive selection","Article","SCOPUS"

RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has recently provided the opportunity to examine variation in gene expression, a surrogate for phenotypic variation, in nonmodel species. We used a comparative RNA-seq approach to assess expression variation within and among adaptively divergent populations of a threatened freshwater fish, Nannoperca australis, found across a steep hydroclimatic gradient in the Murray–Darling Basin, Australia. These populations evolved under contrasting selective environments (e.g., dry/hot lowland; wet/cold upland) and represent opposite ends of the species’ spectrum of genetic diversity and population size. We tested the hypothesis that environmental variation among isolated populations has driven the evolution of divergent expression at ecologically important genes using differential expression (DE) analysis and an anova-based comparative phylogenetic expression variance and evolution model framework based on 27,425 de novo assembled transcripts. Additionally, we tested whether gene expression variance within populations was correlated with levels of standing genetic diversity. We identified 290 DE candidate transcripts, 33 transcripts with evidence for high expression plasticity, and 50 candidates for divergent selection on gene expression after accounting for phylogenetic structure. Variance in gene expression appeared unrelated to levels of genetic diversity. Functional annotation of the candidate transcripts revealed that variation in water quality is an important factor influencing expression variation for N. australis.

Despite advances in genomic technologies, detecting adaptive variation in natural populations remains challenging. Key challenges in gene–environment association studies involve distinguishing the effects of drift from those of selection and identifying subtle signatures of polygenic adaptation. We used paired-end restriction site-associated DNA sequencing data (6,605 biallelic single nucleotide polymorphisms; SNPs) to examine population structure and test for signatures of adaptation across the geographic range of an iconic Australian endemic freshwater fish species, the Murray cod Maccullochella peelii. Two univariate gene–association methods identified 61 genomic regions associated with climate variation. We also tested for subtle signatures of polygenic adaptation using a multivariate method (redundancy analysis; RDA). The RDA analysis suggested that climate (temperature- and precipitation-related variables) and geography had similar magnitudes of effect in shaping the distribution of SNP genotypes across the sampled range of Murray cod. Although there was poor agreement among the candidate SNPs identified by the univariate methods, the top 5% of SNPs contributing to significant RDA axes included 67% of the SNPs identified by univariate methods. We discuss the potential implications of our findings for the management of Murray cod and other species generally, particularly in relation to informing conservation actions such as translocations to improve evolutionary resilience of natural populations.

"Signatures of positive selection and local adaptation to urbanization in white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus)","10.1111/mec.14369","Harris S.E., Munshi-South J.","Urbanization significantly alters natural ecosystems and has accelerated globally. Urban wildlife populations are often highly fragmented by human infrastructure, and isolated populations may adapt in response to local urban pressures. However, relatively few studies have identified genomic signatures of adaptation in urban animals. We used a landscape genomic approach to examine signatures of selection in urban populations of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) in New York City. We analysed 154,770 SNPs identified from transcriptome data from 48 P. leucopus individuals from three urban and three rural populations and used outlier tests to identify evidence of urban adaptation. We accounted for demography by simulating a neutral SNP data set under an inferred demographic history as a null model for outlier analysis. We also tested whether candidate genes were associated with environmental variables related to urbanization. In total, we detected 381 outlier loci and after stringent filtering, identified and annotated 19 candidate loci. Many of the candidate genes were involved in metabolic processes and have well-established roles in metabolizing lipids and carbohydrates. Our results indicate that white-footed mice in New York City are adapting at the biomolecular level to local selective pressures in urban habitats.

In this study, we investigated neutral, adaptive and deleterious genetic variation using 7,192 SNPs in 31 Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush) populations (n = 673) from Québec, Canada. Average genetic diversity was low, weakly shared among lakes, and positively correlated with lake size, indicating a major role for genetic drift subsequent to lake isolation. Putatively deleterious mutations were on average at lower frequencies than the other SNPs, and their abundance relative to the entire polymorphism in each population was positively correlated with inbreeding, suggesting that the effectiveness of purifying selection was negatively correlated with inbreeding, as predicted from theory. Despite evidence for pronounced genetic drift and inbreeding, several outlier loci were associated with temperature and found in or close to genes with biologically relevant functions notably related to heat stress and immune responses. Outcomes of gene–temperature associations were influenced by the inclusion of the most inbred populations, in which allele frequencies deviated the most from model predictions. This result illustrates challenge in identifying gene–environment associations in cases of high genetic drift and restricted gene flow and suggests limited adaptation in populations experiencing higher inbreeding.

Heterozygosity–fitness correlations (HFCs) have been widely used to study this link in wild populations, where key parameters that affect both variability and fitness, such as inbreeding, can be difficult to measure. We used estimates of parental heterozygosity and genetic similarity (‘relatedness’) derived from 32 microsatellite markers to explore the relationship between genetic variability and fitness in a population of the critically endangered hawksbill turtle, Eretmochelys imbricata. We found no effect of maternal MLH (multilocus heterozygosity) on clutch size or egg success rate, and no single-locus effects. However, we found effects of paternal MLH and parental relatedness on egg success rate that interacted in a way that may result in both positive and negative effects of genetic variability. Multicollinearity in these tests was within safe limits, and null simulations suggested that the effect was not an artefact of using paternal genotypes reconstructed from large samples of offspring. Our results could imply a tension between inbreeding and outbreeding depression in this system, which is biologically feasible in turtles: female-biased natal philopatry may elevate inbreeding risk and local adaptation, and both processes may be disrupted by male-biased dispersal. Although this conclusion should be treated with caution due to a lack of significant identity disequilibrium, our study shows the importance of considering both positive and negative effects when assessing how variation in genetic variability affects fitness in wild systems. © 2017 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

Landscape genomics is becoming an increasingly important and powerful tool for rapid assessments of climate adaptation, especially in long-lived species such as trees. We investigated climate adaptation in Eucalyptus microcarpa using the DArTseq genomic approach. A combination of FST outlier and environmental association analyses were performed using &gt;4200 genomewide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 26 populations spanning climate gradients in southeastern Australia. Eighty-one SNPs were identified as putatively adaptive, based on significance in FST outlier tests and significant associations with one or more climate variables related to temperature (70/81), aridity (37/81) or precipitation (35/81). Adaptive SNPs were located on all 11 chromosomes, with no particular region associated with individual climate variables. Climate adaptation appeared to be characterized by subtle shifts in allele frequencies, with no consistent fixed differences identified. Based on these associations, we predict adaptation under projected changes in climate will include a suite of shifts in allele frequencies. Whether this can occur sufficiently rapidly through natural selection within populations, or would benefit from assisted gene migration, requires further evaluation. In some populations, the absence or predicted increases to near fixation of particular adaptive alleles hint at potential limits to adaptive capacity.

In each brood line, both sire and dam components of variation of development time were significant and accounted for a substantially larger portion of variation than their interactions, which suggested that natural selection has acted primarily on additive genetic variation. The implications of these results are that (1) spatially or temporally proximate salmon populations may be structured by distinct adaptations; (2) artificial relaxation of local geneflow barriers may lead to depression of fitness; and (3) populations of salmon genetically structured by local adaptation may carry variation that enhances their persistence during rapid climate change. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",2017,"adaptation; contemporary evolution; development and evolution; life history evolution; natural selection; quantitative genetics","Article","SCOPUS"

Such patterns are especially interesting among populations distributed across habitat gradients, where genetic structure can be driven by isolation by distance (IBD) and/or isolation by environment (IBE). Here, we used variation in ~1,600 high-quality SNPs derived from paired-end sequencing of double-digest restriction site-associated DNA (ddRAD-Seq) to test hypotheses related to IBD and IBE in the Yucatan jay (Cyanocorax yucatanicus), a tropical bird endemic to the Yucatán Peninsula.

We found a moderate level of nucleotide diversity (π =.008) and little evidence for genetic differentiation among vegetation types. Analyses of neutral and putatively adaptive SNPs (identified by complementary genome-scan approaches) indicate that IBD is the most reliable explanation to account for frequency distribution of the former, while IBE has to be invoked to explain those of the later.

"Environmental exposure does not explain putative maladaptation in road-adjacent populations","10.1007/s00442-017-3912-6","Brady S.P.","While the ecological consequences of roads are well described, little is known of their role as agents of natural selection, which can shape adaptive and maladaptive responses in populations influenced by roads. This knowledge gap persists despite a growing appreciation for the influence of evolution in human-altered environments. There, insights indicate that natural selection typically results in local adaptation. Thus, populations influenced by road-induced selection should evolve fitness advantages in their local environment. Contrary to this expectation, wood frog tadpoles from roadside populations show evidence of a fitness disadvantage, consistent with local maladaptation. Specifically, in reciprocal transplants, roadside populations survive at lower rates compared to populations away from roads. A key question remaining is whether roadside environmental conditions experienced by early stage embryos induce this outcome. This represents an important missing piece in evaluating the evolutionary nature of this maladaptation pattern. Here, I address this gap using a reciprocal transplant experiment designed to test the hypothesis that embryonic exposure to roadside pond water induces a survival disadvantage. Contrary to this hypothesis, my results show that reduced survival persists when embryonic exposure is controlled. This outcome indicates that the survival disadvantage is parentally mediated, either genetically and/or through inherited environmental effects. This result suggests that roadside populations are either truly maladapted or potentially locally adapted at later life stages. I discuss these interpretations, noting that regardless of mechanism, patterns consistent with maladaptation have important implications for conservation. In light of the pervasiveness of roads, further resolution explaining maladaptive responses remains a critical challenge in conservation. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",2017,"amphibians; contemporary evolution; inherited environmental effects; local adaptation; runoff","Article","SCOPUS"
"Local adaptation along an environmental cline in a species with an inversion polymorphism","10.1111/jeb.13064","Wellenreuther M., Rosenquist H., Jaksons P., Larson K.W.","Polymorphic inversions are ubiquitous across the animal kingdom and are frequently associated with clines in inversion frequencies across environmental gradients. Such clines are thought to result from selection favouring local adaptation; however, empirical tests are scarce. The seaweed fly Coelopa frigida has an α/β inversion polymorphism, and previous work demonstrated that the α inversion frequency declines from the North Sea to the Baltic Sea and is correlated with changes in tidal range, salinity, algal composition and wrackbed stability. Here, we explicitly test the hypothesis that populations of C. frigida along this cline are locally adapted by conducting a reciprocal transplant experiment of four populations along this cline to quantify survival. We found that survival varied significantly across treatments and detected a significant Location x Substrate interaction, indicating local adaptation. Survival models showed that flies from locations at both extremes had highest survival on their native substrates, demonstrating that local adaptation is present at the extremes of the cline. Survival at the two intermediate locations was, however, not elevated at the native substrates, suggesting that gene flow in intermediate habitats may override selection. Together, our results support the notion that population extremes of species with polymorphic inversions are often locally adapted, even when spatially close, consistent with the growing view that inversions can have direct and strong effects on the fitness of species. © 2017 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

"Potential of contemporary evolution to erode fishery benefits from marine reserves","10.1111/faf.12188","Villegas-Ríos D., Moland E., Olsen E.M.","Marine reserves are valued for their ecological role: protecting fish populations from overharvesting while, at the same time, potentially maintaining fisheries yields via recruitment effects (net export of pelagic eggs and larvae) and spillover (net export of post-settled juveniles and mature fish) across reserve borders. Focussing on the spillover effect, we argue that when fitness of the protected individuals depends on the relative size of their home ranges compared to the reserve size, and home range size is a property of the individuals, rapid local adaptation might occur in favour of individuals with smaller home ranges. Individuals that avoid fishing mortality by spending most of the time inside the reserve limits (i.e. with smaller home ranges) will experience a fitness advantage, whereas individuals that move beyond boundaries (i.e. with larger home ranges) will increase their risk of being harvested by spillover fisheries. We use empirical data on Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) home ranges within and around a coastal marine reserve in south Norway as a case to illustrate our idea. Broadly, we highlight how protection-induced selection and contemporary evolution could fundamentally alter our perspective of marine reserve functioning and recommend quantifying behavioural variability and behavioural consistency of protected populations. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",2017,"adaptive evolution; animal personality; fish behaviour; home range; marine reserves; spillover","Article","SCOPUS"

The critical swimming speeds (Ucrit) of the different crosses were measured in both fresh (FW) and salt water (SW) and the variations in several physiological traits (osmotic, energetic and metabolic capacities) that are predicted to influence swimming performance were documented. Anadromous and resident fish reached the same Ucrit in both FW and SW, with Ucrit being 14% lower in SW compared with FW. The strains, however, seemed to use different underlying strategies: the anadromous strain relied on its streamlined body shape and higher osmoregulatory capacity, while the resident strain had greater citrate synthase (FW) and lactate dehydrogenase (FW, SW) capacity and either greater initial stores or more efficient use of liver (FW, SW) and muscle (FW) glycogen during exercise. Compared with R♀L♂ hybrids, L♀R♂ hybrids had a 20% lower swimming speed, which was associated with a 24% smaller cardio-somatic index and higher physiological costs. Thus swimming performance depends on cross direction (i.e. which parental line was used as dam or sire). The study thus suggests that divergent physiological factors between anadromous and resident S. fontinalis may result in similar swimming capacities that are adapted to their respective lifestyles. © 2017 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles",2017,"hybrids; local adaptation; metabolism; swimming performance","Article","SCOPUS"

Despite this, poor attention has been deserved to the behavioural ecology of hybrids, in particular in relation to their social behaviour. We carried out a camera trap study to assess whether phenotypically anomalous colouration in wild boar, i.e. potentially introgressed with domestic pigs, affected the hierarchical structure of wild boar social groups. Chromatically anomalous wild boars (CAWs) were detected in 32 out of 531 wild boar videos. In most videos (75%) CAWs were the latest of the group, independently from their age class and group composition. Aggressions by their wild type fellows were recorded in 31.25% videos; by contrast, no aggression among wild type individuals was observed. The lack of camouflage may expose CAWs, and thus their group, to a higher predation risk, compared to wild type groups. This individual loss of local adaptation may increase predation risk by the wolf or detection by hunters, being maladaptive for the whole social group. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",2017,"aggressive behaviour; coat colour; hierarchy; hybridization; social units; sus scrofa","Article","SCOPUS"
"Testing for local adaptation and evolutionary potential along altitudinal gradients in rainforest Drosophila: beyond laboratory estimates","10.1111/gcb.13553","O'Brien E.K., Higgie M., Reynolds A., Hoffmann A.A., Bridle J.R.","Predicting how species will respond to the rapid climatic changes predicted this century is an urgent task. Species distribution models (SDMs) use the current relationship between environmental variation and species’ abundances to predict the effect of future environmental change on their distributions. However, two common assumptions of SDMs are likely to be violated in many cases: (i) that the relationship of environment with abundance or fitness is constant throughout a species’ range and will remain so in future and (ii) that abiotic factors (e.g. temperature, humidity) determine species’ distributions. We test these assumptions by relating field abundance of the rainforest fruit fly Drosophila birchii to ecological change across gradients that include its low and high altitudinal limits. We then test how such ecological variation affects the fitness of 35 D. birchii families transplanted in 591 cages to sites along two altitudinal gradients, to determine whether genetic variation in fitness responses could facilitate future adaptation to environmental change. Overall, field abundance was highest at cooler, high-altitude sites, and declined towards warmer, low-altitude sites. By contrast, cage fitness (productivity) increased towards warmer, lower-altitude sites, suggesting that biotic interactions (absent from cages) drive ecological limits at warmer margins. In addition, the relationship between environmental variation and abundance varied significantly among gradients, indicating divergence in ecological niche across the species’ range. However, there was no evidence for local adaptation within gradients, despite greater productivity of high-altitude than low-altitude populations when families were reared under laboratory conditions. Families also responded similarly to transplantation along gradients, providing no evidence for fitness trade-offs that would favour local adaptation. These findings highlight the importance of (i) measuring genetic variation in key traits under ecologically relevant conditions, and (ii) considering the effect of biotic interactions when predicting species’ responses to environmental change. © 2017 The Authors.

"Highly localized divergence within supergenes in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) within the Gulf of Maine","10.1186/s12864-017-3660-3","Barney B.T., Munkholm C., Walt D.R., Palumbi S.R.","Background: Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), is known to vary genetically across the North Atlantic, Greenland, and Newfoundland. This genetic variation occurs both spatially and temporally through decades of heavy fishing, and is concentrated in three linkage disequilibrium blocks, previously defined by pedigreed linkage mapping analysis. Variation within these genomic regions is correlated with both seawater temperature and behavioral ecotype. The full extent and nature of these linkage groups is important information for interpreting cod genetic structure as a tool for future fisheries management. Results: We conducted whole genome sequencing for 31 individual cod from three sub-populations in the Gulf of Maine. Across the genome, we found 3,390,654 intermediate to high frequency Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). We show that pairwise linkage analysis among these SNPs is a powerful tool to detect linkage disequilibrium clusters by recovering the three previously detected linkage groups and identifying the 1031 genes contained therein. Across these genes, we found significant population differentiation among spawning groups in the Gulf of Maine and between Georges Bank and Gulf of Maine. Coordinated divergence among these genes and their differentiation at both short and long spatial scales suggests that they are acting as linked supergenes in local adaptation of cod populations. Conclusions: Differentiation between SNPs in linkage disequilibrium blocks is the major signal of genetic differentiation between all groups tested within the Gulf of Maine. Our data provide a map of genes contained in these blocks, allowing an enhanced search for neutral genetic structure for demographic inference and fisheries modeling. Patterns of selection and the history of populations may be possible to identify in cod using this description of linkage disequilibrium blocks and future data sets to robustly separate neutral and selected genetic markers. © 2017 The Author(s).",2017,"atlantic cod; gadus morhua; genomic divergence; gulf of maine; linkage disequilibrium; linkage map; supergene","Article","SCOPUS"
"Temporal shifts and temperature sensitivity of avian spring migratory phenology: a phylogenetic meta-analysis","10.1111/1365-2656.12612","Usui T., Butchart S.H.M., Phillimore A.B.","There are wide reports of advances in the timing of spring migration of birds over time and in relation to rising temperatures, though phenological responses vary substantially within and among species. An understanding of the ecological, life-history and geographic variables that predict this intra- and interspecific variation can guide our projections of how populations and species are likely to respond to future climate change. Here, we conduct phylogenetic meta-analyses addressing slope estimates of the timing of avian spring migration regressed on (i) year and (ii) temperature, representing a total of 413 species across five continents. We take into account slope estimation error and examine phylogenetic, ecological and geographic predictors of intra- and interspecific variation. We confirm earlier findings that on average birds have significantly advanced their spring migration time by 2·1 days per decade and 1·2 days °C−1. We find that over time and in response to warmer spring conditions, short-distance migrants have advanced spring migratory phenology by more than long-distance migrants. We also find that larger bodied species show greater advance over time compared to smaller bodied species. Our results did not reveal any evidence that interspecific variation in migration response is predictable on the basis of species' habitat or diet. We detected a substantial phylogenetic signal in migration time in response to both year and temperature, suggesting that some of the shifts in migratory phenological response to climate are predictable on the basis of phylogeny. However, we estimate high levels of species and spatial variance relative to phylogenetic variance, which is consistent with plasticity in response to climate evolving fairly rapidly and being more influenced by adaptation to current local climate than by common descent. On average, avian spring migration times have advanced over time and as spring has become warmer. While we are able to identify predictors that explain some of the true among-species variation in response, substantial intra- and interspecific variation in migratory response remains to be explained. © 2016 The Authors.

"Microsatellite genotyping of brown crab cancer pagurus reveals fine scale selection and 'non-chaotic' genetic patchiness within a high gene flow system","10.3354/meps12044","McKeown N.J., Hauser L., Shaw P.W.","Brown crab Cancer pagurus supports one of the most important fisheries in Europe; however, spatial patterns of connectivity and adaptation are largely unknown and difficult to identify due to the species' life history, which entails distinct dispersal characteristics during larval and adult life stages. To address this limitation, spatial-temporal genetic structure using 8 microsatellite loci was assessed across the majority of the species' NE Atlantic distribution. Neutral genetic structuring revealed a background of high gene flow throughout the region, with a superimposed pattern of chaotic genetic patchiness (CGP) linked to stochastic recruitment variability. The CGP was geographically patterned, being prevalent among English Channel samples but absent among North Sea samples, suggesting specific biological (e.g. reproductive ecology) and environmental (seascape) drivers. Such recruitment variability may compromise stock resilience and must be considered within spatial management strategies. Another prominent feature was pronounced differentiation at a single locus for males sampled within a single fjord (Gulmarsfjord) from all other samples, exhibiting the effects of divergent selection. Gulmarsfjord females were genetically similar to all other 'non-fjord' samples, and exhibited a comparative level of differentiation at the outlier locus from the Gulmarsfjord males. Due to known dispersal differences between the sexes, the pattern within Gulmarsfjord can be explained by the intermingling of allochthonous females with resident, locally adapted males and demonstrates the occurrence of fine-scale local adaptation in this species.

In particular, both local adaptation to pathogens and gene flow are thought to explain a large part of the intraspecific variation observed in MHC allelic diversity. To date, however, evidence that adaptation to locally prevalent pathogens maintains MHC variation is limited to species with limited dispersal and, hence, reduced gene flow. On the one hand high gene flow can disrupt local adaptation in species with high dispersal rates, on the other hand such species are much more likely to experience spatial variation in pathogen pressure, suggesting that there may be intense pathogen mediated selection pressure operating across breeding sites in panmictic species. Such pathogen mediated selection pressure operating across breeding sites should therefore be sufficient to maintain high MHC diversity in high dispersing species in the absence of local adaptation mechanisms. We used the Greater Flamingo, Phoenicopterus roseus, a long-lived colonial bird showing a homogeneous genetic structure of neutral markers at the scale of the Mediterranean region, to test the prediction that higher MHC allelic diversity with no population structure should occur in large panmictic populations of long-distance dispersing birds than in other resident species. Results: We assessed the level of allelic diversity at the MHC Class IIB exon 2 from 116 individuals born in four different breeding colonies of Greater Flamingo in the Mediterranean region. We found one of the highest allelic diversity (109 alleles, 2 loci) of any non-passerine avian species investigated so far relative to the number of individuals and loci genotyped. There was no evidence of population structure between the four major Mediterranean breeding colonies. Conclusion: Our results suggest that local adaptation at MHC Class IIB in Greater Flamingos is constrained by high gene flow and high MHC diversity appears to be maintained by population wide pathogen-mediated selection rather than local pathogen-mediated selection. Further understanding of how pathogens vary across space and time will be crucial to further elucidate the mechanisms maintaining MHC diversity in species with large panmictic populations and high dispersal rates. © 2017 The Author(s).",2017,"allelic diversity; greater flamingos; local adaptation; mhc genes; pathogen-mediated balancing selection","Article","SCOPUS"

In this framework, it is important to focus research on the photosynthetic response of habitat-forming species which have an important structural and functional role in coastal ecosystems. Most of the studies on the impacts of OA involve short-term laboratory or micro/mesocosm experiments. It is more challenging to assess the adaptive responses of macroalgal community to decreasing ocean pH over long-term periods, as they represent the basis of trophic dynamics in marine environments. This work aims to study the physiological traits of a population of Sargassum vulgare that lives naturally in the high pCO2 vents system in Ischia (Italy), in order to predict the species behaviour in a possible OA future scenario. With this purpose, the photosynthetic performance of S. vulgare was studied in a wild, natural population living at low pH (6.7) as well as in a population transplanted from native (6.7) to ambient pH (8.1) for three weeks. The main results show that the photochemical activity and Rubisco expression decreased by 30% after transplanting, whereas the non-photochemical dissipation mechanisms and the photosynthetic pigment content increased by 50% and 40% respectively, in order to compensate for the decrease in photochemical efficiency at low pH. Our data indicated a stress condition for the S. vulgare population induced by pH variation, and therefore a reduced acclimation capability at different pH conditions. The decline of the PSII maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm) and the increase of PARP enzyme activity in transplanted thalli further supported this hypothesis. The absence of the species at ambient pH conditions close to the vent system, as well as the differences in physiological traits, suggest a local adaptation of S. vulgare at pH 6.7, through optimization of photosynthetic performance. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",2017,"adaptive response; brown algae; ecophysiology; ocean acidification; poly(adp-ribosylation); stress response","Article","SCOPUS"
"Small-scale habitat-specific variation and adaptive divergence of photosynthetic pigments in different alkali soils in reed identified by common garden and genetic tests","10.3389/fpls.2016.02016","Qiu T., Jiang L., Li S., Yang Y.","Flexibility of photosynthetic pigment traits is an important adaptive mechanism through which plants can increase mean fitness in a variable environment. Unlike morphological traits in plants, photosythesis has been shown to exhibit phenotypic plasticity, responding rapidly to environmental conditions. Meanwhile, local adaptation at small scales is considered to be rare. Thus, detecting the small-scale adaptive divergence of photosynthetic pigments presents a challenge. Leaf concentrations of photosynthetic pigments under stressful conditions may be reduced or maintained. Concentrations of some pigments and/or ratio of Chlorophyll a (Chla) to Chlorophyll b (Chlb) do not change markedly in some species, such as the common reed, Phragmites australis, a cosmopolitan grass and common invader. Little is known about photosynthetic responses of this plant to varying levels of alkali salt. Few studies have attempted to account for the relationship between pigment accumulation and leaf position in wild plant populations in grasslands. In this study, photosynthetic pigment concentrations and the total Chl(a+b)/Car ratio decreased as the growing season progressed and were shown to be significantly lower in the habitat with a higher soil pH value and less moisture when compared between habitats. The Chla/Chlb ratio did not differ significantly between habitats, although it increased significantly over time. Leaves in the middle position may be functionally important in the response to soil conditions because only pigment concentrations and the Chl(a+b)/Car ratio of those leaves varied between habitats significantly. The outlier loci, used to evaluate molecular signatures of selection, were detected by Arlequin, Bayescan, and Bayenv analyses. In the simulated habitats of common garden, the local genotypes had higher values of Chla, Chlb, Chl(a+b), Car in their home habitat than did genotypes originating from the other habitat. QST-FST comparisons provided evidence of divergent selection. It appears likely that soil moisture, pH and electric conductivity drove local adaptation. Combined approaches that utilize information on phenotypes from field and common garden experiments, genome-wide markers, and environmental data will be the most informative for understanding the adaptive nature of the intraspecific divergence. © 2017 Qiu, Jiang, Li and Yang.",2017,"alkali salt; leaf position; local adaptation; outlier loci; photosynthetic pigment; population genomics; reed; selection","Article","SCOPUS"

Species distributed across such biogeographic discontinuities are thus more prone to develop genetic clines and adaptations to environmental variation. The northwest coast of France encompasses a biogeographic boundary between cold- and warmerate marine ecosystems. Distinct hydrographic features characterize northern and southern shores, promoting physical oceanographic breaks that can affect dispersal and connectivity between populations. Furthermore, mosaics of contrasting conditions may affect local patterns of species assemblages and potential adaptive pressures. Along this stretch of coast, the intertidal habitat is largely dominated by brown algae of the genus Fucus, key structuring species common along North Atlantic shorelines. Fucus spiralis, F. guiryi and F. vesiculosus are sister species with different mating systems. They have extensive sympatric geographical distributions and distinct but overlapping vertical distributions in the intertidal zone. We examined genetic structure and diversity across this major environmental transition zone using neutral microsatellite markers to investigate patterns of differentiation between populations of each species inhabiting the two different biogeographic regions. We found contrasting results between the dioecious species (F. vesiculosus) and the two selfing hermaphroditic lineages (F. spiralis and F. guiryi). Genetic differentiation of northern and southern populations of F. vesiculosus followed the expectation from a hypothetical oceanographic discontinuity across this biogeographical transition zone, but this was not the case for the two hermaphroditic species. The former had higher genetic diversity and structure along the distribution range investigated whereas selfing hermaphrodites had less variability and were not geographically structured. Our results suggest that genetic patterns are correlated with this biogeographical transition zone but this effect is dependent on mating system, a determining factor affecting population structure.

However, once established, invaders might also be controlled by taking advantage of adaptations of threatened species to local conditions. This strategy was explored in dwarf galaxias (Galaxiella pusilla) a freshwater-dependent species of national conservation significance in Australia, threatened by invasive eastern gambusia (Gambusia holbrooki). Most habitats occupied by G. pusilla experience a seasonally variable and unpredictable hydrologic regime, where water levels substantially contract during dry periods and expand during wet periods. It was hypothesised that they are likely to have developed adaptations to surviving in these habitats by persisting without surface water. In contrast to G. holbrooki, we found that G. pusilla could withstand longer periods without surface water, including air breathing and higher respiration rates in air, than could G. holbrooki. We showed, within a single G. pusilla population, large inter-annual variability in fish densities linked to natural wetting and drying regimes. These findings indicate that periodic drying provides a way of protecting G. pusilla in water bodies where G. holbrooki has invaded, representing a strategy that takes advantage of local adaptation and metapopulation structure of G. pusilla. © CSIRO 2017.",2017,"air breathing; behavioural adaptation; gambusia holbrooki; invasive; metapopulation; physiological adaptation.","Article","SCOPUS"

For marine ectotherms such as fish, temperature is a key abiotic factor, influencing metabolic processes. Species distribution and abundance are driven by reproduction and growth, which depend on available energy exceeding baseline maintenance costs. These routine metabolic costs make up a large part of the energy expenditure. Thermal stress can increase routine metabolism, affecting an organism’s fitness. Data of routine metabolic rates of Antarctic fish are scarce, and comparability of existing data sets is often problematic due to ecological differences between species and in experimental protocols. Our objective was to compare routine metabolism and thermal sensitivity of species with similar ecotypes but different thermal environments to assess possible ecological implications of warming waters on energy expenditure in Antarctic fish, a fauna characterised by geographic isolation, endemism and putative thermal adaptation. We measured routine metabolic rates of three benthic Antarctic fish species from low- and high-Antarctic regions at habitat temperature and during acute temperature increase. Our analysis revealed differences in metabolic rates at the same temperature suggesting local adaptation to habitat temperature. Acute thermal stress induced a comparable response of metabolic rates to increasing temperature. We conclude that higher metabolic rates and thus higher energetic costs could be associated with narrower thermal windows, a potential disadvantage to the endemic high-Antarctic fish fauna facing the challenge of climate change. © 2016, The Author(s).",2017,"metabolic cold adaptation; notothenioids; polar fish; respiration; routine metabolic rate","Article","SCOPUS"

We investigate spatial distributions of immunogenetic variation in American badger subspecies (Taxidea taxus), as a proxy for evaluating their evolutionary potential across the northern extent of the species’ range. We compared genetic structure of 20 microsatellites and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC DRB exon 2) to evaluate whether small, isolated populations show low adaptive polymorphism relative to large and well-connected populations. Our results suggest that gene flow plays a prominent role in shaping MHC polymorphism across large spatial scales, while the interplay between gene flow and selection was stronger towards the northern peripheries. The similarity of MHC alleles within subspecies relative to their neutral genetic differentiation suggests that adaptive divergence among subspecies can be maintained despite ongoing gene flow along subspecies boundaries. Neutral genetic diversity was low in small relative to large populations, but MHC diversity within individuals was high in small populations. Despite reduced neutral genetic variation, small and isolated populations harbour functional variation that likely contribute to the species evolutionary potential at the northern range.

"On the maintenance of genetic variation and adaptation to environmental change: considerations from population genomics in fishes","10.1111/jfb.13145","Bernatchez L.","The first goal of this paper was to overview modern approaches to local adaptation, with a focus on the use of population genomics data to detect signals of natural selection in fishes. Several mechanisms are discussed that may enhance the maintenance of genetic variation and evolutionary potential, which have been overlooked and should be considered in future theoretical development and predictive models: the prevalence of soft sweeps, polygenic basis of adaptation, balancing selection and transient polymorphisms, parallel evolution, as well as epigenetic variation. Research on fish population genomics has provided ample evidence for local adaptation at the genome level. Pervasive adaptive evolution, however, seems to almost never involve the fixation of beneficial alleles. Instead, adaptation apparently proceeds most commonly by soft sweeps entailing shifts in frequencies of alleles being shared between differentially adapted populations. One obvious factor contributing to the maintenance of standing genetic variation in the face of selective pressures is that adaptive phenotypic traits are most often highly polygenic, and consequently the response to selection should derive mostly from allelic co-variances among causative loci rather than pronounced allele frequency changes. Balancing selection in its various forms may also play an important role in maintaining adaptive genetic variation and the evolutionary potential of species to cope with environmental change. A large body of literature on fishes also shows that repeated evolution of adaptive phenotypes is a ubiquitous evolutionary phenomenon that seems to occur most often via different genetic solutions, further adding to the potential options of species to cope with a changing environment. Moreover, a paradox is emerging from recent fish studies whereby populations of highly reduced effective population sizes and impoverished genetic diversity can apparently retain their adaptive potential in some circumstances. Although more empirical support is needed, several recent studies suggest that epigenetic variation could account for this apparent paradox. Therefore, epigenetic variation should be fully integrated with considerations pertaining to role of soft sweeps, polygenic and balancing selection, as well as repeated adaptation involving different genetic basis towards improving models predicting the evolutionary potential of species to cope with a changing world. © 2016 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles",2016,"adaptation; conservation; environmental change; parallel evolution; population genomics; radseq","Article","SCOPUS"

We analyzed geographic patterns of phenotypic diversity, quantified levels of within-population SNP diversity, and also determined the extent of population structure across the range of this species. We then used these data to identify significantly over-differentiated loci as indicators of genomic regions that likely contribute to local adaptation. Results: Traits including flowering time, plant height, and seed oil composition (i.e., percentage of saturated fatty acids) were significantly correlated with latitude, and thus differentiated northern vs. southern populations. Average pairwise FST was found to be 0.21, and a STRUCTURE analysis identified two significant clusters that largely separated northern and southern individuals. The significant FST outliers included a SNP in HaFT2, a flowering time gene that has been previously shown to co-localize with flowering time QTL, and which exhibits a known cline in gene expression. Conclusions: Latitudinal differentiation in both phenotypic traits and SNP allele frequencies is observed across wild sunflower populations in central North America. Such differentiation may play an important adaptive role across the range of this species, and could facilitate adaptation to a changing climate. © 2016 The Author(s).",2016,"latitudinal variation; local adaptation; phenotypic differentiation; population genetics; sunflower","Article","SCOPUS"
"Transatlantic invasion routes and adaptive potential in North American populations of the invasive glossy buckthorn, Frangula alnus","10.1093/aob/mcw157","De Kort H., Mergeay J., Jacquemyn H., Honnay O.","Background and Aims Many invasive species severely threaten native biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. One of the most prominent questions in invasion genetics is how invasive populations can overcome genetic founder effects to establish stable populations after colonization of new habitats. High native genetic diversity and multiple introductions are expected to increase genetic diversity and adaptive potential in the invasive range. Our aim was to identify the European source populations of Frangula alnus (glossy buckthorn), an ornamental and highly invasive woody species that was deliberately introduced into North America at the end of the 18th century. A second aim of this study was to assess the adaptive potential as an explanation for the invasion success of this species. Methods Using a set of annotated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were assigned a putative function based on sequence comparison with model species, a total of 38 native European and 21 invasive North American populations were subjected to distance-based structure and assignment analyses combined with population genomic tools. Genetic diversity at SNPs with ecologically relevant functions was considered as a proxy for adaptive potential. Key Results Patterns of invasion coincided with early modern transatlantic trading routes. Multiple introductions through transatlantic trade from a limited number of European port regions to American urban areas led to the establishment of bridgehead populations with high allelic richness and expected heterozygosity, allowing continuous secondary migration to natural areas. Conclusions Targeted eradication of the urban populations, where the highest genetic diversity and adaptive potential were observed, offers a promising strategy to arrest further invasion of native American prairies and forests. © The Author 2016.

"A DNA-based assessment of the phylogenetic position of a morphologically distinct, anchialine-lake-restricted seahorse","10.1093/jhered/esw048","Rose E., Masonjones H.D., Jones A.G.","Isolated populations provide special opportunities to study local adaptation and incipient speciation. In some cases, however, morphological evolution can obscure the taxonomic status of recently founded populations. Here, we use molecular markers to show that an anchialinelake-restricted population of seahorses, originally identified as Hippocampus reidi, appears on the basis of DNA data to be Hippocampus erectus. We collected seahorses from Sweetings Pond, on Eleuthera Island, Bahamas, during the summer of 2014. We measured morphological traits and sequenced 2 genes, cytochrome b and ribosomal protein S7, from 19 seahorses in our sample. On the basis of morphology, Sweetings Pond seahorses could not be assigned definitively to either of the 2 species of seahorse, H. reidi and H. erectus, that occur in marine waters surrounding the Bahamas. However, our DNA-based phylogenetic analysis showed that the Sweetings Pond fish were firmly nested within the H. erectus clade with a Bayesian posterior probability greater than 0.99. Thus, Sweetings Pond seahorses most recently shared a common ancestor with H. erectus populations from the Western Atlantic. Interestingly, the seahorses from Sweetings Pond differ morphologically from other marine populations of H. erectus in having a more even torso to tail length ratio. The substantial habitat differences between Sweetings Pond and the surrounding coastal habitat make Sweetings Pond seahorses particularly interesting from the perspectives of conservation, local adaptation, and incipient speciation. © The American Genetic Association 2016.",2016,"cytochrome b; fish; genetics; hippocampus erectus; isolated population; lake; nuclear gene s7; seahorse","Article","SCOPUS"
"Strong genetic differentiation but not local adaptation toward the range limit of a coastal dune plant","10.1111/evo.13047","Samis K.E., López-Villalobos A., Eckert C.G.","All species have limited geographic distributions; but the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms causing range limits are largely unknown. That many species’ geographic range limits are coincident with niche limits suggests limited evolutionary potential of marginal populations to adapt to conditions experienced beyond the range. We provide a test of range limit theory by combining population genetic analysis of microsatellite polymorphisms with a transplant experiment within, at the edge of, and 60 km beyond the northern range of a coastal dune plant. Contrary to expectations, lifetime fitness increased toward the range limit with highest fitness achieved by most populations at and beyond the range edge. Genetic differentiation among populations was strong, with very low, nondirectional gene flow suggesting range limitation via constraints to dispersal. In contrast, however, local adaptation was negligible, and a distance-dependent decline in fitness only occurred for those populations furthest from home when planted beyond the range limit. These results challenge a commonly held assumption that stable range limits match niche limits, but also raise questions about the unique value of peripheral populations in expanding species’ geographical ranges. © 2016 The Author(s).

"Genetic and phenotypic variation along an ecological gradient in lake trout Salvelinus namaycush","10.1186/s12862-016-0788-8","Baillie S.M., Muir A.M., Hansen M.J., Krueger C.C., Bentzen P.","Background: Adaptive radiation involving a colonizing phenotype that rapidly evolves into at least one other ecological variant, or ecotype, has been observed in a variety of freshwater fishes in post-glacial environments. However, few studies consider how phenotypic traits vary with regard to neutral genetic partitioning along ecological gradients. Here, we present the first detailed investigation of lake trout Salvelinus namaycush that considers variation as a cline rather than discriminatory among ecotypes. Genetic and phenotypic traits organized along common ecological gradients of water depth and geographic distance provide important insights into diversification processes in a lake with high levels of human disturbance from over-fishing. Results: Four putative lake trout ecotypes could not be distinguished using population genetic methods, despite morphological differences. Neutral genetic partitioning in lake trout was stronger along a gradient of water depth, than by locality or ecotype. Contemporary genetic migration patterns were consistent with isolation-by-depth. Historical gene flow patterns indicated colonization from shallow to deep water. Comparison of phenotypic (Pst) and neutral genetic variation (Fst) revealed that morphological traits related to swimming performance (e.g., buoyancy, pelvic fin length) departed more strongly from neutral expectations along a depth gradient than craniofacial feeding traits. Elevated phenotypic variance with increasing water depth in pelvic fin length indicated possible ongoing character release and diversification. Finally, differences in early growth rate and asymptotic fish length across depth strata may be associated with limiting factors attributable to cold deep-water environments. Conclusion: We provide evidence of reductions in gene flow and divergent natural selection associated with water depth in Lake Superior. Such information is relevant for documenting intraspecific biodiversity in the largest freshwater lake in the world for a species that recently lost considerable genetic diversity and is now in recovery. Unknown is whether observed patterns are a result of an early stage of incipient speciation, gene flow-selection equilibrium, or reverse speciation causing formerly divergent ecotypes to collapse into a single gene pool. © 2016 The Author(s).",2016,"adaptation; geometric morphometrics; intraspecific variation; lake superior; microsatellite dna; multiple coinertia analysis; phenotype","Article","SCOPUS"

Currently, there is limited comparative genomics insight into the evolution of dietary specializations in mammals. Due to recent advances in sequencing technologies, we were able to perform in-depth whole genome analyses of representatives of these three dietary groups. Results: We investigated the evolution of carnivory by comparing 18 representative genomes from across Mammalia with carnivorous, omnivorous, and herbivorous dietary specializations, focusing on Felidae (domestic cat, tiger, lion, cheetah, and leopard), Hominidae, and Bovidae genomes. We generated a new high-quality leopard genome assembly, as well as two wild Amur leopard whole genomes. In addition to a clear contraction in gene families for starch and sucrose metabolism, the carnivore genomes showed evidence of shared evolutionary adaptations in genes associated with diet, muscle strength, agility, and other traits responsible for successful hunting and meat consumption. Additionally, an analysis of highly conserved regions at the family level revealed molecular signatures of dietary adaptation in each of Felidae, Hominidae, and Bovidae. However, unlike carnivores, omnivores and herbivores showed fewer shared adaptive signatures, indicating that carnivores are under strong selective pressure related to diet. Finally, felids showed recent reductions in genetic diversity associated with decreased population sizes, which may be due to the inflexible nature of their strict diet, highlighting their vulnerability and critical conservation status. Conclusions: Our study provides a large-scale family level comparative genomic analysis to address genomic changes associated with dietary specialization.

"Taking the heat: distinct vulnerability to thermal stress of central and threatened peripheral lineages of a marine macroalga","10.1111/ddi.12474","Saada G., Nicastro K.R., Jacinto R., McQuaid C.D., Serrão E.A., Pearson G.A., Zardi G.I.","Aim: Although many studies have reported the effects of climate change on species' distributions, most of them consider each species as a physiologically homogenous unit. However, different lineages or populations inhabiting distinct bioregions within a species' distributional range can retain unique genetic diversity that could result in distinct adaptive capacities. A recent, large, climate-correlated distributional range contraction occurred at the southern edge of the intertidal macroalga Fucus vesiculosus, causing loss of genetic diversity unique to the southern clade. We tested for differential selective constraints and signs of local adaptation to thermal stress in the two genetic lineages. Location: Iberian Atlantic shores. Methods: We performed a series of common garden experiments and a field reciprocal transplant. Results: In the laboratory, southern F. vesiculosus showed higher resilience to heat stress than northern individuals. On the southwest coast of Portugal, local individuals grew more than those transplanted from the northern range; in the north of Portugal, growth rates did not differ significantly between lineages. Conclusions: We present evidence for unique adaptive traits at the retreating edge of the species' distribution that could be lost if warming trends persist. The loss of the distinct southern genetic heritage could end potential ongoing diversification or speciation processes and impoverishes the adaptive potential of the species as a whole. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",2016,"climate change; fucus vesiculosus; rear-edge","Article","SCOPUS"

However, the relative roles of genetic and environmental effects on the HT have rarely been explored. We studied experimentally the parental effects on the HT and size of vendace (Coregonus albula (L.)) and whitefish (C. lavaretus L.) larvae under short and long winter conditions using a full-factorial breeding design. Both parents significantly affected the HT of vendace, mostly by additive genetic effects, and the difference between short and long winter treatment was also significant. In whitefish, the female × male interaction was significant, implying non-additive genetic effects. The maximum range of the HT of eggs between parent pairs within certain winter condition was 3 weeks and was clearly lower than the potential range for the temperature-adjusted HT. The size of eggs or hatched larvae did not correlate with the HT in either of the species.

Because sexual conflict is common in the suborder Calanoida, we tested whether sexual selection drives differentiation between populations. We conducted mating experiments between two geographically adjacent but morphologically different populations of the calanoid copepod Acanthodiaptomus denticornis from the French lakes Lac Pavin and Lac de Montcineyre. We detected sex-specific inter-population differences in mating success. In particular, Lac de Montcineyre males (M males) exhibited a higher mating success in short matings than Lac Pavin males (P males). In contrast to M females, P females showed population-density-dependent fecundity. Furthermore, survival of P females decreased in inter-population groups. We suggest that planktivorous glassworm larvae, which inhabit only Lac de Montcineyre, impose selection on copulating pairs of copepods. This may adaptively increase the ability of M males to fertilize eggs during short matings and indirectly decrease sensitivity of M females to male coercion. The former adaptation might result in a fitness disadvantage of P male immigrants in Lac de Montcineyre, whereas the latter redefines a ""battleground"" for population-specific sexual conflict.

Evaluating population-level impacts of sublethal exposure concentrations is, however, complex and confounded by other environmental pressures. Applying effect measures derived from laboratory-based chemical exposures to impacts in wild fish populations is constrained by uncertainty on how biochemical response measures (biomarkers) translate into health outcomes, lack of available data for chronic exposures and the many uncertainties in available fish population models. Furthermore, wild fish show phenotypic plasticity and local adaptations can occur that adds geographic and temporal variance on responses. Such population-level factors are rarely considered in the chemical risk assessment process and can probably be derived only from studies on wild fish. Molecular technologies, including microsatellite and SNP genotyping, and RNASeq for gene expression studies, are advancing our understanding of mechanisms of eco-toxicological response, tolerance, adaptation and selection in wild populations. We examine critically the application of such approaches with examples including using microsatellites that has identified roach (Rutilus rutilus) populations living in rivers contaminated with sewage effluents that are self-sustaining, and studies of stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) that have identified genomic regions under selection putatively related to pollution tolerance. Integrating data on biological effects between laboratory-based studies and wild populations, and building understanding on adaptive responses to sublethal exposure are some of the priority research areas for more effective evaluation of population risks and resilience to contaminant exposure. © 2015 The Authors.

"Genetic diversity and structuring across the range of a widely distributed ladybird: focus on rear-edge populations phenotypically divergent","10.1002/ece3.2288","Lecompte É., Bouanani M.-A., Magro A., Crouau-Roy B.","Population genetics and phenotypic structures are often predicted to vary along the geographic range of a species. This phenomenon would be accentuated for species with large range areas, with discontinuities and marginal populations. We herein compare the genetic patterns of central populations of Coccinella septempunctata L. with those of two phenotypically differentiated populations considered as rear-edge populations and subspecies based on phenotype (Algeria and Japan). According to the central-marginal model and expected characteristics of rear-edge populations, we hypothesize that these rear-edge populations have (1) a reduced genetic diversity, resulting from their relative isolation over long periods of time, (2) a higher population genetic differentiation, explained by low contemporary gene flow levels, and (3) a relationship between genetic diversity characteristics and phenotypes, due to historical isolation and/or local adaptation. Based on genotyping of 28 populations for 18 microsatellite markers, several levels of regional genetic diversity and differentiation are observed between and within populations, according to their localization: low within-population genetic diversity and higher genetic differentiation of rear-edge populations. The genetic structuring clearly dissociates the Algerian and Eastern Asia populations from the others. Geographical patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation support the hypothesis of the central-marginal model. The pattern observed is in agreement with the phenotypic structure across species range. A clear genetic break between populations of Algeria, the Eastern Asia, and the remaining populations is a dominant feature of the data. Differential local adaptations, absence of gene flow between marginal and central populations, and/or incapacity to mate after colonization, have contributed to their distinct genotypic and phenotypic characteristics. © 2016 The Authors.

Females in spawning runs tended to be larger and older than males, but growth rates were similar between sexes. As predicted, females had larger and more lipid-rich gonads and livers, and lower somatic condition and muscle lipid concentrations than males. Within populations, gonad size, fecundity, and egg size were related primarily to body size, and secondarily to indices of adult condition. Gonadosomatic index (GSI) increased with body size in females and declined with body size in males. Egg size increased with female size and declined with liver size and/or lipid content, whereas relative fecundity showed opposite trends. In contrast, egg lipid content appeared to be more strongly related to liver size and lipid content (positive effects) than to female size. Among populations, growth rate and muscle lipid concentration declined from south to north, but contrary to predictions, none of the reproductive traits examined showed strong covariation with environmental gradients.

However, evidence for local adaptation and phenotypic differentiation in highly mobile species, experiencing high levels of gene flow, is emerging. Assessing population genetic structure at different spatial scales is thus a crucial step towards understanding mechanisms underlying intraspecific differentiation and diversification. Here, we studied the population genetic structure of a highly mobile species - the great tit Parus major - at different spatial scales. We analysed 884 individuals from 30 sites across Europe including 10 close-by sites (&lt; 50 km), using 22 microsatellite markers. Overall we found a low but significant genetic differentiation among sites (FST = 0.008). Genetic differentiation was higher, and genetic diversity lower, in south-western Europe. These regional differences were statistically best explained by winter temperature. Overall, our results suggest that great tits form a single patchy metapopulation across Europe, in which genetic differentiation is independent of geographical distance and gene flow may be regulated by environmental factors via movements related to winter severity.

It is hypothesized that selection will reduce energetic costs of osmoregulation in a population's native osmotic habitat, producing patterns of local adaptation. Killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus, occupy estuarine habitats where salinities range from fresh to seawater. Populations inhabiting an environmental salinity gradient differ in physiological traits associated with acclimation to acute salinity stress, consistent with local adaptation. Similarly, metabolic rates differ in populations adapted to different temperatures, but have not been studied in regard to salinity. We investigated evidence for local adaptation between populations of killifish native to fresh and brackish water habitats. Aerobic scope (the difference between minimum and maximum metabolic rates), excess post-exercise oxygen consumption, and swimming performance (time and distance to reach exhaustion) were used as proxies for fitness in fresh and brackish water treatments. Swimming performance results supported local adaptation; fish native to brackish water habitats performed significantly better than freshwater-native fish at high salinity while low salinity performance was similar between populations. However, results from metabolic measures did not support this conclusion; both populations showed an increase in resting metabolic rate and a decrease of aerobic scope in fresh water. Similarly, excess post-exercise oxygen consumption was higher for both populations in fresh than in brackish water. While swimming results suggest that environmentally dependent performance differences may be a result of selection in divergent osmotic environments, the differences between populations are not coupled with divergence in metabolic performance. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",2016,"aerobic scope; excess post-exercise oxygen consumption; fundulus heteroclitus; local adaptation; osmoregulation; salinity","Article","SCOPUS"

However, tests of local adaptation rarely consider multiple fitness-related traits although focus on a single component of fitness can be misleading. Here, we concomitantly examined genetic structure and co-divergence patterns of the trematode Coitocaecum parvum and its crustacean host Paracalliope fluviatilis among isolated populations using the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene (COI). We then performed experimental cross-infections between two genetically divergent host-parasite populations. Both hosts and parasites displayed genetic differentiation among populations, although genetic structure was less pronounced in the parasite. Data also supported a co-divergence scenario between C. parvum and P. fluviatilis potentially related to local co-adaptation. Results from cross-infections indicated that some parasite lineages seemed to be locally adapted to their sympatric (home) hosts in which they achieved higher infection and survival rates than in allopatric (away) amphipods. However, local, intrinsic host and parasite characteristics (host behavioural or immunological resistance to infections, parasite infectivity or growth rate) also influenced patterns of host-parasite interactions. For example, overall host vulnerability to C. parvum varied between populations, regardless of parasite origin (local vs. foreign), potentially swamping apparent local co-adaptation effects. Furthermore, local adaptation effects seemed trait specific; different components of parasite fitness (infection and survival rates, growth) responded differently to cross-infections. Overall, data show that genetic differentiation is not inevitably coupled with local adaptation, and that the latter must be interpreted with caution in a multi-trait context. © 2016 The Linnean Society of London.",2016,"coitocaecum parvum; cross-infections; isolated host-parasite populations; paracalliope fluviatilis; sympatric versus allopatric hosts","Article","SCOPUS"

Here, we explore the utility of an alternative approach - ""environmental correlation analysis, ECA,"" which tests for clines in allele frequencies across a gradient of an environmental selection pressure - to identify genes that have historically protected against death from malaria. We collected genotype data from 12,425 newborns on 57 candidate malaria resistance loci and 9,756 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected at random from across the genome, and examined their allele frequencies for geographic correlations with long-term malaria prevalence data based on 84,042 individuals living under different historical selection pressures from malaria in coastal Kenya. None of the 57 candidate SNPs showed significant (P < 0.05) correlations in allele frequency with local malaria transmission intensity after adjusting for population structure and multiple testing. In contrast, two of the random SNPs that had highly significant correlations (P < 0.01) were in genes previously linked to malaria resistance, namely, CDH13, encoding cadherin 13, and HS3ST3B1, encoding heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferase 3B1. Both proteins play a role in glycoprotein-mediated cell-cell adhesion which has been widely implicated in cerebral malaria, the most life-threatening form of this disease.

Here we describe a new species, S. plana, through incubation of non-calcified cysts from sediments collected in the South China Sea and Caspian Sea. The vegetative cells consist of a conical epitheca and a rounded hypotheca with the plate formula of Po, X, 4′, 3a, 7′′, 5C+t, 5S, 5′′′, 2′′′′. It differs from other Scrippsiella species by its flattened body in dorsoventral view and a small first anterior intercalary (1a) plate (half the size of plate 3a). Scrippsiellaplana strains from the South China Sea and Caspian Sea share identical internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences, and show phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation in growth rate at various salinities, consistent with the environments in which they originated. In addition, two strains of S. spinifera were obtained by incubating ellipsoid cysts with calcareous spines from sediments collected along the Turkish and Hawaiian coast. They also share identical ITS sequences and differ from Duboscquodinium collinii (a parasite of tintinnids) only at two base pair positions (in the ITS2 region). Molecular phylogeny based on ITS and large subunit ribosomal DNA (LSU rDNA) sequences revealed that S. plana was nested within the Calciodinellum (CAL) clade and S. spinifera within the S. trochoidea (STR) clade.

Thus, it is important to investigate patterns of both phenotypic and genetic variations among populations to reveal the respective roles of these two types of factors in driving population differentiation. Here, we test for evidence of phenotypic and genetic structure across populations of a passerine bird (Zosterops borbonicus) distributed along a steep elevational gradient on the island of Réunion. Using 11 microsatellite loci screened in 401 individuals from 18 localities distributed along the gradient, we found that genetic differentiation occurred at two spatial levels: (i) between two main population groups corresponding to highland and lowland areas, respectively, and (ii) within each of these two groups. In contrast, several morphological traits varied gradually along the gradient. Comparison of neutral genetic differentiation (FST) and phenotypic differentiation (PST) showed that PST largely exceeds FST at several morphological traits, which is consistent with a role for local adaptation in driving morphological divergence along the gradient. Overall, our results revealed an area of secondary contact midway up the gradient between two major, cryptic, population groups likely diverged in allopatry.

"Evidence of resilience to past climate change in Southwest Asia: Early farming communities and the 9.2 and 8.2 ka events","10.1016/j.quascirev.2015.06.022","Flohr P., Fleitmann D., Matthews R., Matthews W., Black S.","Climate change is often cited as a major factor in social change. The so-called 8.2 ka event was one of the most pronounced and abrupt Holocene cold and arid events. The 9.2 ka event was similar, albeit of a smaller magnitude. Both events affected the Northern Hemisphere climate and caused cooling and aridification in Southwest Asia. Yet, the impacts of the 8.2 and 9.2 ka events on early farming communities in this region are not well understood. Current hypotheses for an effect of the 8.2 ka event vary from large-scale site abandonment and migration (including the Neolithisation of Europe) to continuation of occupation and local adaptation, while impacts of the 9.2 ka have not previously been systematically studied. In this paper, we present a thorough assessment of available, quality-checked radiocarbon (14C) dates for sites from Southwest Asia covering the time interval between 9500 and 7500 cal BP, which we interpret in combination with archaeological evidence. In this way, the synchronicity between changes observed in the archaeological record and the rapid climate events is tested. It is shown that there is no evidence for a simultaneous and widespread collapse, large-scale site abandonment, or migration at the time of the events. However, there are indications for local adaptation. We conclude that early farming communities were resilient to the abrupt, severe climate changes at 9250 and 8200 cal BP. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",2016,"8.2 ka event; 9.2 ka event; climate and society; neolithic; resilience; southwest asia","Article","SCOPUS"

We studied individual and population-level fitness costs of a climate change-induced stressor: camouflage mismatch in seasonally colour molting species confronting decreasing snow cover duration. Based on field measurements of radiocollared snowshoe hares, we found strong selection on coat colour molt phenology, such that animals mismatched with the colour of their background experienced weekly survival decreases up to 7%. In the absence of adaptive response, we show that these mortality costs would result in strong population-level declines by the end of the century. However, natural selection acting on wide individual variation in molt phenology might enable evolutionary adaptation to camouflage mismatch.

"Divergent natural selection promotes immigrant inviability at early and late stages of evolutionary divergence","10.1111/evo.12872","Ingley S.J., Johnson J.B.","Natural selection's role in speciation has been of fundamental importance since Darwin first outlined his theory. Recently, work has focused on understanding how selection drives trait divergence, and subsequently reproductive isolation. ""Immigrant inviability,"" a barrier that arises from selection against immigrants in their nonnative environment, appears to be of particular importance. Although immigrant inviability is likely ubiquitous, we know relatively little about how selection acts on traits to drive immigrant inviability, and how important immigrant inviability is at early-versus-late stages of divergence. We present a study evaluating the role of predation in the evolution of immigrant inviability in recently diverged population pairs and a well-established species pair of Brachyrhaphis fishes. We evaluate performance in a high-predation environment by assessing survival in the presence of a predator, and swimming endurance in a low-predation environment. We find strong signatures of local adaptation and immigrant inviability of roughly the same magnitude both early and late in divergence. We find remarkably conserved selection for burst-speed swimming (important in predator evasion), and selection for increased size in low-predation environments. Our results highlight the consistency with which selection acts during speciation, and suggest that similar factors might promote initial population differentiation and maintain differentiation at late stages of divergence. © 2016, Society for the Study of Evolution.",2016,"brachyrhaphis; mesocosm; path analysis; poeciliidae; predation; swimming performance","Article","SCOPUS"
"A biogeographic perspective on early human colonization of the Tibetan Plateau","10.1016/j.ara.2016.01.004","Rhode D.","Whence came the early human colonizers of the Tibetan Plateau? Recent genomic research of modern Tibetan gene pool diversity provides evidence of numerous different founding haplogroups among populations. Age estimates suggest that much of the Tibetan gene pool is the product of Holocene migration and admixture, but at least one distinct ancestral haplotype may pre-date the last glacial maximum. Key genes conferring high-altitude adaptation to Tibetan populations suggest that those populations diverged from Han Chinese ancestors between ~ 8-18 cal ka BP. Diverse Upper Paleolithic technological packages existed in different regions around the margins of the Plateau that could have been carried up by potential early colonizers. However, archeological evidence of early (pre-Neolithic) occupation on the Plateau itself is remarkably uniform, consisting of small short-term camps with a mixed lithic technology featuring simple flakes and shatter, microblades and microcores, larger blades or bladelets, discoidal tablet cores, and occasional bipolar pebble cores; well-dated sites are all post-glacial in age. A simple biogeographic model, the ""up from the north"" hypothesis, asserts that human groups best suited to colonizing the harsh alpine Plateau environments would have been those adapted to life typical of higher latitudes, and those advantaged northern-latitude colonizers routinely carried microlithic technology with them in hunting the same Palearctic steppe fauna found on the Plateau. The archeological record of early colonizers on the Plateau should therefore be dominated by the north Asian epi-Paleolithic technological package in which microblades were a key component. Complications to this simple model, and possible scenarios addressing the disparity between the evidence from historical genetics and the archeological record, are considered. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"Host dispersal as the driver of parasite genetic structure: A paradigm lost?","10.1111/ele.12564","Mazé-Guilmo E., Blanchet S., Mccoy K.D., Loot G.","Understanding traits influencing the distribution of genetic diversity has major ecological and evolutionary implications for host-parasite interactions. The genetic structure of parasites is expected to conform to that of their hosts, because host dispersal is generally assumed to drive parasite dispersal. Here, we used a meta-analysis to test this paradigm and determine whether traits related to host dispersal correctly predict the spatial co-distribution of host and parasite genetic variation. We compiled data from empirical work on local adaptation and host-parasite population genetic structure from a wide range of taxonomic groups. We found that genetic differentiation was significantly lower in parasites than in hosts, suggesting that dispersal may often be higher for parasites. A significant correlation in the pairwise genetic differentiation of hosts and parasites was evident, but surprisingly weak. These results were largely explained by parasite reproductive mode, the proportion of free-living stages in the parasite life cycle and the geographical extent of the study; variables related to host dispersal were poor predictors of genetic patterns. Our results do not dispel the paradigm that parasite population genetic structure depends on host dispersal. Rather, we highlight that alternative factors are also important in driving the co-distribution of host and parasite genetic variation. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS.",2016,"animals; co-structure; coevolution; gene flow; host-parasite interactions; local adaptation; meta-analyses; migration rate; plants; population genetics; trait diversity","Article","SCOPUS"
"Future climate change is predicted to shift long-term persistence zones in the cold-temperate kelp Laminaria hyperborea","10.1016/j.marenvres.2015.11.005","Assis J., Lucas A.V., Bárbara I., Serrão E.T.","Global climate change is shifting species distributions worldwide. At rear edges (warmer, low latitude range margins), the consequences of small variations in environmental conditions can be magnified, producing large negative effects on species ranges. A major outcome of shifts in distributions that only recently received attention is the potential to reduce the levels of intra-specific diversity and consequently the global evolutionary and adaptive capacity of species to face novel disturbances. This is particularly important for low dispersal marine species, such as kelps, that generally retain high and unique genetic diversity at rear ranges resulting from long-term persistence, while ranges shifts during climatic glacial/interglacial cycles. Using ecological niche modelling, we (1) infer the major environmental forces shaping the distribution of a cold-temperate kelp, Laminaria hyperborea (Gunnerus) Foslie, and we (2) predict the effect of past climate changes in shaping regions of long-term persistence (i.e., climatic refugia), where this species might hypothetically harbour higher genetic diversity given the absence of bottlenecks and local extinctions over the long term. We further (3) assessed the consequences of future climate for the fate of L. hyperborea using different scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions (RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5). Results show NW Iberia, SW Ireland and W English Channel, Faroe Islands and S Iceland, as regions where L. hyperborea may have persisted during past climate extremes until present day. All predictions for the future showed expansions to northern territories coupled with the significant loss of suitable habitats at low latitude range margins, where long-term persistence was inferred (e.g., NW Iberia). This pattern was particularly evident in the most agressive scenario of climate change (RCP 8.5), likely driving major biodiversity loss, changes in ecosystem functioning and the impoverishment of the global gene pool of L. hyperborea. Because no genetic baseline is currently available for this species, our results may represent a first step in informing conservation and mitigation strategies. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",2016,"climate change; ecologial niche modelling; kelp forests; laminaria hyperborea; local persistence; phylogeography; range shifts","Article","SCOPUS"

We investigated the physiological responses to light and temperature of gametophytes from two populations of Laminaria digitata in contrasting environments along the French coast of the English Channel. Gametophytes of both populations were highly tolerant of high light through an efficient down-regulation of photosynthesis triggered by the activation of the xanthophyll cycle. Temperature increases promoted photosynthesis and photosystem II showed high resistance to short-term exposure to high temperatures currently encountered in the field. Gametophytes from the two sites displayed some differences in their pigment content and photosynthetic characteristics, but low replication and difference in time of sampling precluded tests of potential local adaptation to the light conditions at each site, as observed in previously published results on adult sporophytes.

"The genetic basis of upland/lowland ecotype divergence in switchgrass (Panicum virgatum)","10.1534/g3.116.032763","Milano E.R., Lowry D.B., Juenger T.E.","The evolution of locally adapted ecotypes is a common phenomenon that generates diversity within plant species. However, we know surprisingly little about the genetic mechanisms underlying the locally adapted traits involved in ecotype formation. The genetic architecture underlying locally adapted traits dictates how an organism will respond to environmental selection pressures, and has major implications for evolutionary ecology, conservation, and crop breeding. To understand the genetic architecture underlying the divergence of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) ecotypes, we constructed a genetic mapping population through a four-way outbred cross between two northern upland and two southern lowland accessions. Trait segregation in this mapping population was largely consistent with multiple independent loci controlling the suite of traits that characterizes ecotype divergence. We assembled a joint linkage map using ddRADseq, and mapped quantitative trait loci (QTL) for traits that are divergent between ecotypes, including flowering time, plant size, physiological processes, and disease resistance. Overall, we found that most QTL had small to intermediate effects. While we identified colocalizing QTL for multiple traits, we did not find any large-effect QTL that clearly controlled multiple traits through pleiotropy or tight physical linkage. These results indicate that ecologically important traits in switchgrass have a complex genetic basis, and that similar loci may underlie divergence across the geographic range of the ecotypes. © 2016 Milano et al.",2016,"flowering time; genetic architecture; local adaptation; qtl; trait syndromes","Article","SCOPUS"
"Population genomic footprints of fine-scale differentiation between habitats in Mediterranean blue tits","10.1111/mec.13486","Szulkin M., Gagnaire P.-A., Bierne N., Charmantier A.","Linking population genetic variation to the spatial heterogeneity of the environment is of fundamental interest to evolutionary biology and ecology, in particular when phenotypic differences between populations are observed at biologically small spatial scales. Here, we applied restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-Seq) to test whether phenotypically differentiated populations of wild blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) breeding in a highly heterogeneous environment exhibit genetic structure related to habitat type. Using 12 106 SNPs in 197 individuals from deciduous and evergreen oak woodlands, we applied complementary population genomic analyses, which revealed that genetic variation is influenced by both geographical distance and habitat type. A fine-scale genetic differentiation supported by genome- and transcriptome-wide analyses was found within Corsica, between two adjacent habitats where blue tits exhibit marked differences in breeding time while nesting < 6 km apart. Using redundancy analysis (RDA), we show that genomic variation remains associated with habitat type when controlling for spatial and temporal effects. Finally, our results suggest that the observed patterns of genomic differentiation were not driven by a small proportion of highly differentiated loci, but rather emerged through a process such as habitat choice, which reduces gene flow between habitats across the entire genome. The pattern of genomic isolation-by-environment closely matches differentiation observed at the phenotypic level, thereby offering significant potential for future inference of phenotype-genotype associations in a heterogeneous environment. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2016,"blue tit; genetic differentiation; landscape genetics; local adaptation; population genomics; rad sequencing","Article","SCOPUS"
"Genome-wide SNPs reveal fine-scale differentiation among wingless alpine stonefly populations and introgression between winged and wingless forms","10.1111/evo.12826","Dussex N., Chuah A., Waters J.M.","Insect flight loss is a repeated phenomenon in alpine habitats, where wing reduction is thought to enhance local recruitment and increase fecundity. One predicted consequence of flight loss is reduced dispersal ability, which should lead to population genetic differentiation and perhaps ultimately to speciation. Using a dataset of 15,123 SNP loci, we present comparative analyses of fine-scale population structure in codistributed Zelandoperla stonefly species, across three parallel altitudinal transects in New Zealand's Rock and Pillar mountain range. We find that winged populations (altitude 200-500 m; Zelandoperla decorata) show no genetic structuring within or among streams, suggesting substantial dispersal mediated by flight. By contrast, wingless populations (Zelandoperla fenestrata; altitude 200-1100 m) exhibit distinct genetic clusters associated with each stream, and additional evidence of isolation by distance within streams. Our data support the hypothesis that wing-loss can initiate diversification in alpine insect populations over small spatial scales. The often deep phylogenetic placement of lowland Z. fenestrata within their stream-specific clades suggests the possibility of independent alpine colonization events for each stream. Additionally, the detection of winged, interspecific hybrid individuals raises the intriguing possibility that a previously flightless lineage could reacquire flight via introgression. © 2016, Society for the Study of Evolution.",2016,"adaptation; alpine; dispersal; divergence; flight loss; genomics; hybridization; insect; introgression; speciation","Article","SCOPUS"
"Population differentiation and countergradient variation throughout the geographic range in the fern gametophyte Vittaria appalachiana","10.3732/ajb.1500077","Chambers S.M., Emery N.C.","PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Theory predicts that limited gene flow between populations will promote population differentiation, and experimental studies have found that differentiation is often explained by local adaptation in sexually reproducing angiosperms. However, few experiments have examined the drivers of differentiation among populations in asexual land plants with limited dispersal potential. Here, we evaluated the role of temperature in driving population differentiation in an asexual, obligate gametophyte fern species. METHODS: We reciprocally transplanted Vittaria appalachiana gametophytes among six populations that spanned the species’ geographic range in the Appalachian Mountains and Plateau. Temperature, survival, and senescence rates were measured for 1 year. KEY RESULTS: Populations had significantly different fitness responses to different sites, consistent with the hypothesis that populations have differentiated across the species’ range. There was some evidence for local adaptation in marginal populations and for countergradient selection favoring particularly robust genotypes at the northern range edge. Most populations had relatively high fitness at the site with the most stable temperature conditions and were negatively affected by decreasing minimum temperatures. CONCLUSIONS: Populations of Vittaria appalachiana exhibit highly variable responses to transplantation across the species’ range, and only a small subset of these responses are due to local adaptation. Differences in daily minimum temperature explain some variation in fitness, but other site-specific factors also have significant impacts on transplant fitness. These results indicate that asexual, patchily distributed species with limited dispersal may exhibit population-specific responses to global climate change that have not been elucidated by empirical work focused on sexually reproducing angiosperms. © 2016 Botanical Society of America.",2016,"climate change; countergradient selection; gametophyte; geographic range; local adaptation; population differentiation; pteridaceae; reciprocal transplant; temperature variation; vittaria appalachiana","Article","SCOPUS"

"Evolutionary genetic consequences of facultative sex and outcrossing","10.1111/jeb.12770","Hartfield M.","Explaining the selective forces that underlie different reproductive modes forms a major part of evolution research. Many organisms are facultative sexuals, with the ability to reproduce both sexually and asexually. Reduced sequencing costs means it is now possible to start investigating genome sequences of a wider number of these organisms in depth, but teasing apart the genetic forces underlying the maintenance of facultative sexual reproduction remains a challenge. An analogous problem exists when determining the genetic consequences of a degree of outcrossing (and recombination) in otherwise self-fertilizing organisms. Here, I provide an overview of existing research on the evolutionary basis behind different reproductive modes, with a focus on explaining the population genetic effects favouring low outcrossing rates in either partially selfing or asexual species. I review the outcomes that both self-fertilization and asexuality have on either purging deleterious mutations or fixing beneficial alleles, and what empirical data exist to support these theories. In particular, a greater application of mathematical models to genomic data has provided insight into the numerous effects that transitions to self-fertilization from outcrossing have on genetic architecture. Similar modelling approaches could be used to determine the forces shaping genetic diversity of facultative sexual species. Hence, a further unification of mathematical models with next-generation sequence data will prove important in exploring the genetic influences on reproductive system evolution. © 2016 European Society for Evolutionary Biology.",2016,"adaptation; asexuality; genomics; selfing; sexual reproduction","Article","SCOPUS"

The first step to elucidate the potential for adaptation to unfavorable thermal conditions is to assess the degree of genotype-based variation in thermal reaction norms of vital fitness traits. Marine broadcast spawning fishes experience extremely high rates ofmortality during early life stages. Paternally derived (genetic) variation underlying offspring fitness in adverse environmental conditions may therefore hold important implications for resilience. This study examined how males differ in their ability to sire viable offspring and whether the paternal contribution modified thermal reaction norms for hatching success in two replicated trials with cod Gadus morhua from the Northwest Atlantic (trial 1) and Baltic Sea (trial 2). Each trial included five temperature treatments (2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0 °C in trial 1, and 6.5, 8.0, 9.5, 11.0, 12.5 °C in trial 2) encompassing optimum conditions as well as the amount of warming projected in various future pathways for the year 2100. In both trials, mean hatching success significantly decreased towards thermal extremes. However, half-sibling families varied in their response to different incubation temperatures as indicated by significant paternity × temperature interactions and crossing of reaction norms. The influence of paternity itself was highly significant and explained 56% and 44% of the observed variation in hatching success in trials 1 and 2, respectively. Early embryogenesis represented the most crucial developmental period in terms of thermal tolerance and paternally mediated variation in hatching success. High variation in daily embryo survival among half-sibling families and temperature treatments was observed during blastula and gastrulation stages (until 100% epiboly), while almost no mortality occurred during subsequent development and throughout the hatching period. The observed magnitude of genetic variation underlying thermal reaction norms for embryo viability represents a relevant resource for adaptive responses (favorable selection) of cod populations exposed to environmental variability and/or directional changes, such as ongoing ocean warming. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",2016,"adaptation; atlantic cod; gastrulation; ocean warming; paternal effects","Article","SCOPUS"

Population genomic analyses of these data support the hypothesis of recent and repeated, independent colonization of freshwater habitats by oceanic ancestors. We find evidence of recurrent gene flow between oceanic and freshwater ecotypes where they co-occur. Our data implicate natural selection in phenotypic diversification and support the hypothesis that the metapopulation organization of this species helps maintain a large pool of genetic variation that can be redeployed rapidly when oceanic stickleback colonize freshwater environments. We find that the freshwater populations, despite population genetic analyses clearly supporting their young age, have diverged phenotypically from oceanic ancestors to nearly the same extent as populations that were likely founded thousands of years ago.

Results: Here the genome sequence of wild-born African cheetahs reveals extreme genomic depletion in SNV incidence, SNV density, SNVs of coding genes, MHC class I and II genes, and mitochondrial DNA SNVs. Cheetah genomes are on average 95 % homozygous compared to the genomes of the outbred domestic cat (24.08 % homozygous), Virunga Mountain Gorilla (78.12 %), inbred Abyssinian cat (62.63 %), Tasmanian devil, domestic dog and other mammalian species. Demographic estimators impute two ancestral population bottlenecks: one >100,000 years ago coincident with cheetah migrations out of the Americas and into Eurasia and Africa, and a second 11,084-12,589 years ago in Africa coincident with late Pleistocene large mammal extinctions. MHC class I gene loss and dramatic reduction in functional diversity of MHC genes would explain why cheetahs ablate skin graft rejection among unrelated individuals. Significant excess of non-synonymous mutations in AKAP4 (p<0.02), a gene mediating spermatozoon development, indicates cheetah fixation of five function-damaging amino acid variants distinct from AKAP4 homologues of other Felidae or mammals; AKAP4 dysfunction may cause the cheetah's extremely high (>80 %) pleiomorphic sperm.

"Genetic load, inbreeding depression, and hybrid vigor covary with population size: An empirical evaluation of theoretical predictions","10.1111/evo.12802","Lohr J.N., Haag C.R.","Reduced population size is thought to have strong consequences for evolutionary processes as it enhances the strength of genetic drift. In its interaction with selection, this is predicted to increase the genetic load, reduce inbreeding depression, and increase hybrid vigor, and in turn affect phenotypic evolution. Several of these predictions have been tested, but comprehensive studies controlling for confounding factors are scarce. Here, we show that populations of Daphnia magna, which vary strongly in genetic diversity, also differ in genetic load, inbreeding depression, and hybrid vigor in a way that strongly supports theoretical predictions. Inbreeding depression is positively correlated with genetic diversity (a proxy for Ne), and genetic load and hybrid vigor are negatively correlated with genetic diversity. These patterns remain significant after accounting for potential confounding factors and indicate that, in small populations, a large proportion of the segregation load is converted into fixed load. Overall, the results suggest that the nature of genetic variation for fitness-related traits differs strongly between large and small populations.

"Environmental adaptation in Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) throughout their North American range","10.1111/mec.13409","Hecht B.C., Matala A.P., Hess J.E., Narum S.R.","Landscape genomics is a rapidly growing field with recent advances in both genotyping efficiency and statistical analyses that provide insight towards local adaptation of populations under varying environmental and selective pressure. Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) are a broadly distributed Pacific salmon species, occupying a diversity of habitats throughout the northeastern Pacific with pronounced variation in environmental and climate features but little is understood regarding local adaptation in this species. We used a multivariate method, redundancy analysis (RDA), to identify polygenic correlations between 19 703 SNP loci and a suite of environmental variables in 46 collections of Chinook salmon (1956 total individuals) distributed throughout much of its North American range. Models in RDA were conducted on both rangewide and regional scales by hierarchical partitioning of the populations into three distinct genetic lineages. Our results indicate that between 5.8 and 21.8% of genomic variation can be accounted for by environmental features, and 566 putatively adaptive loci were identified as targets of environmental adaptation. The most influential drivers of adaptive divergence included precipitation in the driest quarter of the year (Rangewide and North Coastal Lineage, anova P = 0.002 and 0.01, respectively), precipitation in the wettest quarter of the year (Interior Columbia River Stream-Type Lineage, anova P = 0.03), variation in mean diurnal range in temperature (South Coastal Lineage, anova P = 0.005), and migration distance (Rangewide, anova P = 0.001). Our results indicate that environmental features are strong drivers of adaptive genomic divergence in this species, and provide a foundation to investigate how Chinook salmon might respond to global environmental change. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2015,"conservation; landscape genomics; multivariate; radseq; redundancy analysis; salmonid","Article","SCOPUS"

Stocking can homogenize population structure, impede local adaptation, and hinder the use of genetic stock identification as a fishery management tool. Using 12 microsatellite loci, we evaluate the spatiotemporal genetic structure of 16 anadromous alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) populations in Maine, USA, to determine whether inter-basin stocking practices have influenced population structure and the genetic diversity of the species in this region. Although, no pre-supplementation samples exist, comparative analyses of stocked and non-stocked populations show that stock transfers have influenced alewife population genetic structure. Genetic isolation by distance (IBD) was non-significant among stocked populations, but significant among non-stocked populations. However, two populations, Dresden Mills and Sewell Pond, appear to have resisted genetic homogenization despite stocking. Non-significant genic and genetic differentiations were broadly distributed among alewife populations. Hierarchical AMOVA indicated highly significant differentiation among temporal replicates within populations, and Bayesian clustering analysis revealed weak population structure. A significant correlation was observed between stocking (time and events) and pairwise (Formula Presented.) among alewife collections, and an analysis of IBD residuals showed a significant decline in the amount of genetic differentiation among populations as the extent of stocking activity increased.

"Physical and physiological costs of ectoparasitic mites on host flight endurance","10.1111/een.12218","Luong L.T., Penoni L.R., Horn C.J., Polak M.","1. Dispersal is essential for locating mates, new resources, and to escape unfavourable conditions. Parasitism can impact a host's ability to perform energetically demanding activities such as long-distance flight, with important consequences for gene flow and meta-population dynamics. 2. Ectoparasites, in particular, can adversely affect host flight performance by diminishing flight aerodynamics and/or by inflicting physiological damage while feeding on host tissue. 3. Experimental flight assays were conducted using two fruit fly-mite systems: Drosophila nigrospiracula (Patterson and Wheeler) - Macrocheles subbadius (Berlese) and D. hydei (Sturtevan) - M. muscaedomesticae (Scopoli). Flies that are burdened by mites are expected to exhibit lower flight endurance compared to uninfected flies. 4. The results show that the presence of mites (attached) significantly decreased flight endurance by 57% and 78% compared to uninfected D. nigrospiracula and D. hydei, respectively. The physiological damage caused by M. subbadius was revealed through a 53% decline in flight time among previously infected flies (mites removed just prior to flight assay). Surprisingly, the presumably phoretic M. muscaedomesticae also caused a 62% reduction in flight endurance among previously infected D. hydei. 5. These results suggest a strong deleterious effect of ectoparasitic mites on host flight performance, mediated by a reduction in flight aerodynamics and damage to host physiology. Adverse effects on host flight and/or dispersal may have broad implications for gene flow, population genetic structure, and local adaptation in both host and parasite meta-populations. © 2015 The Royal Entomological Society.",2015,"dispersal; drosophila; host-parasite interaction; infection; insect flight; macrocheles; parasitism","Article","SCOPUS"

Despite extensive evidence of climate-driven advances in phenological events over recent decades, comparable patterns across species' geographic ranges have seldom been described. Even fewer studies have quantified concurrent spatial gradients and temporal trends between phenology and climate. Here we analyse a large data set (~129 000 phenology measures) over 37 years across the UK to provide the first phylogenetic comparative analysis of the relative roles of plasticity and local adaptation in generating spatial and temporal patterns in butterfly mean flight dates. Although populations of all species exhibit a plastic response to temperature, with adult emergence dates earlier in warmer years by an average of 6.4 days per °C, among-population differences are significantly lower on average, at 4.3 days per °C. Emergence dates of most species are more synchronised over their geographic range than is predicted by their relationship between mean flight date and temperature over time, suggesting local adaptation. Biological traits of species only weakly explained the variation in differences between space-temperature and time-temperature phenological responses, suggesting that multiple mechanisms may operate to maintain local adaptation. As niche models assume constant relationships between occurrence and environmental conditions across a species' entire range, an important implication of the temperature-mediated local adaptation detected here is that populations of insects are much more sensitive to future climate changes than current projections suggest. © 2015 The Authors.",2015,"butterfly monitoring scheme; climate change; life history; local adaptation; phenology; plasticity; temperature; traits","Article","SCOPUS"
"Among-lake reciprocal transplants induce convergent expression of immune genes in threespine stickleback","10.1111/mec.13295","Stutz W.E., Schmerer M., Coates J.L., Bolnick D.I.","Geographic variation in parasite communities can drive evolutionary divergence in host immune genes. However, biotic and abiotic environmental variation can also induce plastic differences in immune function among populations. At present, there is little information concerning the relative magnitudes of heritable vs. induced immune divergence in natural populations. We examined immune gene expression profiles of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) from six lakes on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Parasite community composition differs between lake types (large or small, containing limnetic- or benthic-like stickleback) and between watersheds. We observed corresponding differences in immune gene expression profiles among wild-caught stickleback, using a set of seven immune genes representing distinct branches of the immune system. To evaluate the role of environmental effects on this differentiation, we experimentally transplanted wild-caught fish into cages in their native lake, or into a nearby foreign lake. Transplanted individuals' immune gene expression converged on patterns typical of their destination lake, deviating from their native expression profile. Transplant individuals' source population had a much smaller effect, suggesting relatively weak genetic underpinning of population differences in immunity, as viewed through gene expression. This strong environmental regulation of immune gene expression provides a counterpoint to the large emerging literature documenting microevolution and genetic diversification of immune function. Our findings illustrate the value of studying immunity in natural environmental settings where the immune system has evolved and actively functions. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2015,"gasterosteus aculeatus; immunity; local adaptation; plasticity; reciprocal transplant","Article","SCOPUS"
"How mechanisms of habitat preference evolve and promote divergence with gene flow","10.1111/jeb.12683","Berner D., Thibert-Plante X.","Habitat preference may promote adaptive divergence and speciation, yet the conditions under which this is likely are insufficiently explored. We use individual-based simulations to study the evolution and consequence of habitat preference during divergence with gene flow, considering four different underlying genetically based behavioural mechanisms: natal habitat imprinting, phenotype-dependent, competition-dependent and direct genetic habitat preference. We find that the evolution of habitat preference generally requires initially high dispersal, is facilitated by asymmetry in population sizes between habitats, and is hindered by an increasing number of underlying genetic loci. Moreover, the probability of habitat preference to emerge and promote divergence differs greatly among the underlying mechanisms. Natal habitat imprinting evolves most easily and can allow full divergence in parameter ranges where no divergence is possible in the absence of habitat preference. The reason is that imprinting represents a one-allele mechanism of assortative mating linking dispersal behaviour very effectively to local selection. At the other extreme, direct genetic habitat preference, a two-allele mechanism, evolves under restricted conditions only, and even then facilitates divergence weakly. Overall, our results indicate that habitat preference can be a strong reproductive barrier promoting divergence with gene flow, but that this is highly contingent on the underlying preference mechanism. © 2015 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.",2015,"imprinting; individual-based simulation; local adaptation; nonrandom dispersal; parapatric speciation; phenotypic plasticity","Article","SCOPUS"

Indeed, it is often difficult to identify the molecular basis of adaptation to contrasted environments, and nongenetic effects increase the difficulty to disentangle fixed effects, such as genetic adaptation, from variable effects, such as individual phenotypic plasticity, in adaptation. Nevertheless, this question is also of great importance for understanding the evolution of species in a context of climate change. The red coral (Corallium rubrum) lives in the Mediterranean Sea, where at depths ranging from 5 to 600 m, it meets very contrasted thermal conditions. The shallowest populations of this species suffered from mortality events linked with thermal anomalies that have highlighted thermotolerance differences between individuals. We provide here a new transcriptomic resource, as well as candidate markers for the study of local adaptation. We sequenced the transcriptome of six individuals from 5 m and six individuals from 40 m depth at the same site of the Marseilles bay, after a period of common garden acclimatization. We found differential expression maintained between the two depths even after common garden acclimatization, and we analysed the polymorphism pattern of these samples. We highlighted contigs potentially implicated in the response to thermal stress, which could be good candidates for the study of thermal adaptation for the red coral. Some of these genes are also involved in the response to thermal stress in other corals. Our method enables the identification of candidate loci of local adaptation useful for other nonmodel organisms. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2015,"cnidarians; gene expression; local adaptation; octocoral polymorphism; transcriptome","Article","SCOPUS"

The combination of historical records and genetic data can help to determine the origin of invasive / introduced species and allow the identification of the sources and dispersal process. We analyzed the genetic structure of Chinook salmon in the Futaleufú River (Pacific slope basin of Patagonia) using single nucleotide polymorphism genotypes and a recently described baseline dataset of native North American Chinook salmon populations. Our results revealed that Chinook salmon established in the Futaleufú River have high levels of within-population genetic diversity compared with populations from across the native range. Based on genetic similarity and historical reports, our results indicate that the Futaleufú population was first established by colonizing fish derived from the Lower Columbia River Basin, imported into Chile for ocean ranching purposes during the 1970s and 1980s, and afterward it was strongly supplemented by escaped fish from net pen aquaculture that used broodstock imported during the 1990s from various sources, including the California Central Valley (via New Zealand), the Middle Oregon Coast, and Vancouver Island. The higher incidence of fish derived from the most recent introductions in our sample suggest that the contribution of escaped salmon from these posterior stockings on establishment success must have been particularly strong because included different sources. Subsequent admixture and hybridization among these multiple independent source stocks is likely responsible for the high level of standing genetic variation, which may be facilitating local adaptation and augmenting the opportunity for successful invasion and further colonization. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",2015,"chinook salmon; pacific slope basin of patagonia; potential origin","Article","SCOPUS"

Therefore, we tested for evolutionary divergence in aerobic exercise physiology in laboratory bred, size-matched crosses of ancestral, benthic, normal Lake Whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) and derived, limnetic, more actively swimming ""dwarf"" ecotypes. We acclimated fish to constant swimming (emulating limnetic foraging) and control conditions (emulating normal activity levels) to simultaneously study phenotypic plasticity. We found extensive divergence between ecotypes: dwarf fish generally had constitutively higher values of traits related to oxygen transport (ventricle size) and use by skeletal muscle (percent oxidative muscle, mitochondrial content), and also evolved differential plasticity of mitochondrial function (Complex I activity and flux through Complexes I-IV and IV). The effects of swim training were less pronounced than differences among ecotypes and the traits which had a significant training effect (ventricle protein content, ventricle malate dehydrogenase activity, and muscle Complex V activity) did not differ among ecotypes. Only one trait, ventricle mass, varied in a similar manner with acclimation and adaptation and followed a pattern consistent with genetic accommodation.

While freshwater fishes have provided a compelling example of the link between the environment and phenotypic diversity, few studies have been conducted with arid-zone fishes, particularly those that occur in geographically isolated regions where species typically inhabit intermittent and ephemeral creeks. We investigated morphological variation of a freshwater fish (the western rainbowfish, Melanotaenia australis) inhabiting creeks in the Pilbara region of northwest Australia to determine whether body shape variation correlated with local environmental characteristics, including water velocity, habitat complexity, predator presence, and food availability. We expected that the geographic isolation of creeks within this arid region would result in habitat-specific morphological specializations. We used landmark-based geometric morphometrics to quantify the level of morphological variability in fish captured from 14 locations within three distinct subcatchments of a major river system. Western rainbowfish exhibited a range of morphologies, with variation in body depth accounting for a significant proportion (>42%) of the total variance in shape. Sexual dimorphism was also apparent, with males displaying deeper bodies than females. While the measured local habitat characteristics explained little of the observed morphological variation, fish displayed significant morphological differentiation at the level of the subcatchment. Local adaptation may partly explain the geographic patterns of body shape variation, but fine-scale genetic studies are required to disentangle the effects of genetic differentiation from environmentally determined phenotypic plasticity in body shape. Developing a better understanding of environment-phenotype relationships in species from arid regions will provide important insights into ecological and evolutionary processes in these unique and understudied habitats. © 2015 The Authors.

"Population regulation in Gyrodactylus salaris-Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) interactions: Testing the paradigm","10.1186/s13071-015-0981-4","Ramírez R., Bakke T.A., Harris P.D.","Background: Gyrodactylus salaris is a directly transmitted ectoparasite that reproduces in situ on its fish host. Wild Norwegian (East Atlantic) salmon stocks are thought to be especially susceptible to the parasite due to lack of co-adaptation, contrary to Baltic salmon stocks. This study i) identifies whether time-and density-dependent mechanisms in gyrodactylid population growth exist in G. salaris-Atlantic salmon interactions and ii) based on differences between Norwegian and Baltic stocks, determines whether the 'Atlantic susceptible, Baltic resistant' paradigm holds as an example of local adaptation. Methods: A total of 18 datasets of G. salaris population growth on individually isolated Atlantic salmon (12 different stocks) infected with three parasite strains were re-analysed using a Bayesian approach. Datasets included over 2000 observations of 388 individual fish. Results: The best fitting model of population growth was time-limited; parasite population growth rate declined consistently from the beginning of infection. We found no evidence of exponential population growth in any dataset. In some stocks, a density dependence in the size of the initial inoculum limited the maximum rate of parasite population growth. There is no evidence to support the hypothesis that all Norwegian and Scottish Atlantic salmon stocks are equally susceptible to G. salaris, while Baltic stocks control and limit infections due to co-evolution. Northern and Western Norwegian as well as the Scottish Shin stocks, support higher initial parasite population growth rates than Baltic, South-eastern Norwegian, or the Scottish Conon stocks, and several Norwegian stocks tested (Akerselva, Altaelva, Lierelva, Numedalslågen), and the Scottish stocks (i.e. Conon, Shin), were able to limit infections after 40-50 days. No significant differences in performance of the three parasite strains (Batnfjordselva, Figga, and Lierelva), or the two parasite mitochondrial haplotypes (A and F) were observed. Conclusions: Our study shows a spectrum of growth rates, with some fish of the South-eastern Norwegian stocks sustaining parasite population growth rates overlapping those seen on Baltic Neva and Indalsälv stocks. This observation is inconsistent with the 'Baltic-resistant, Atlantic-susceptible' hypothesis, but suggests heterogeneity, perhaps linked to other host resistance genes driven by selection for local disease syndromes. © 2015 Ramírez et al.",2015,"density-dependence; host-parasite dynamics; local adaptation; time-dependence; transmission biology","Article","SCOPUS"

In this paper, we analyze people’s perceptions of environmental and climate-related transformations in communities across the Western Solomon Islands through ethnographic and geospatial methods. Specifically, we documented people’s observed changes over the past decades across various environmental domains, and for each change, we asked respondents to identify the causes, timing, and people’s adaptive responses. We also incorporated this information into a geographical information system database to produce broad-scale base maps of local perceptions of environmental change. Results suggest that people detected changes that tended to be acute (e.g., water clarity, logging intensity, and agricultural diseases). We inferred from these results that most local observations of and adaptations to change were related to parts of environment/ecosystem that are most directly or indirectly related to harvesting strategies. On the other hand, people were less aware of slower insidious/chronic changes identified by scientific studies.

"Identifying signatures of sexual selection using genomewide selection components analysis","10.1002/ece3.1546","Flanagan S.P., Jones A.G.","Sexual selection must affect the genome for it to have an evolutionary impact, yet signatures of selection remain elusive. Here we use an individual-based model to investigate the utility of genome-wide selection components analysis, which compares allele frequencies of individuals at different life history stages within a single population to detect selection without requiring a priori knowledge of traits under selection. We modeled a diploid, sexually reproducing population and introduced strong mate choice on a quantitative trait to simulate sexual selection. Genome-wide allele frequencies in adults and offspring were compared using weighted FST values. The average number of outlier peaks (i.e., those with significantly large FST values) with a quantitative trait locus in close proximity (""real"" peaks) represented correct diagnoses of loci under selection, whereas peaks above the FST significance threshold without a quantitative trait locus reflected spurious peaks. We found that, even with moderate sample sizes, signatures of strong sexual selection were detectable, but larger sample sizes improved detection rates. The model was better able to detect selection with more neutral markers, and when quantitative trait loci and neutral markers were distributed across multiple chromosomes. Although environmental variation decreased detection rates, the identification of real peaks nevertheless remained feasible. We also found that detection rates can be improved by sampling multiple populations experiencing similar selection regimes. In short, genome-wide selection components analysis is a challenging but feasible approach for the identification of regions of the genome under selection. © 2015 The Authors.",2015,"adaptation; population genetics; population genomics; rad-seq; reproductive success; simulation model","Article","SCOPUS"

Our analysis reveals shared patterns of phenotypic plasticity due to thermal acclimation as well as non-neutral patterns of variation among populations adapted to different thermal environments. For the majority of significant differences in gene expression levels, phenotypic plasticity and adaptation operate on different suites of genes. The subset of genes that demonstrate both adaptive differences and phenotypic plasticity, however, exhibit countergradient variation of expression. Thus, expression differences among populations counteract environmental effects, reducing the phenotypic differentiation between populations. Finally, gene-by-environment interactions among genes with non-neutral patterns of expression suggest that the penetrance of adaptive variation depends on the environmental conditions experienced by the individual. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2015,"adaptation; fish; genomics; phenotypic plasticity","Article","SCOPUS"

In-depth genome-wide analyses suggest that Amblyrhynchus diverged from its sister group, the Galaápagos land iguanas, around 4.5 million years ago (Ma), but divergence among extant populations is exceedingly young (less than 50 000 years). Despite Amblyrhynchus appearing as a single long-branch species phylogenetically, we find strong population structure between islands, and one case of incipient speciation of sister lineageswithin the same island—ostensibly initiated by volcanic events. Hybridization between both lineages is exceedingly rare, yet frequent hybridization with migrants from nearby islands is evident. The contemporary snapshot provided by highly variable markers indicates that speciation events may have occurred throughout the evolutionary history of marine iguanas, though these events are not visible in the deeper phylogenetic trees. We hypothesize that the observed interplay of speciation and hybridization might be a mechanism by which local adaptations, generated by incipient speciation, can be absorbed into a common gene pool, thereby enhancing the evolutionary potential of the species as a whole. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

The use of behavioural responses of resident populations as bioindicator of shoreline stability has been tested under various conditions, including after soft and hard engineering actions to stabilise eroded beaches. Port structures likely have impact on sediment longshore transportation and shoreline stability. The question was whether talitrid orientation behaviour could be proposed as bioindicator of impacts also for sandy bays of limited extension and highly used for recreation, such as those in the vicinity of touristic port structures. Orientation experiments were carried out on a set of sandy beaches of different extension and morphology, each of them in the vicinity of a touristic port, across the Mediterranean coasts. The protocol included field orientation tests of populations of talitrids, then analysed in terms of orientation precision seawards (considering sun compass orientation as the most locally adapted behavioural mechanism) in different seasons (before and after the touristic season) and times of day. The populations from more protected (either naturally or artificially) headland-bays showed a higher precision of orientation with respect to the shoreline direction than those from extended beaches, more subject to changes in longshore sedimentary transport as consequence of natural and human activities. The distance from the port and touristic pressure had no influence on talitrid orientation. An important stabilising factor for the sandy beach ecosystems, including talitrid populations and their behavioural adaptation, appeared to be the presence of seagrass banquette. The behavioural data point out that biotic information proceeding from local animal populations linked to beach sediments may complement sedimentology data and allow scaling the impacts occurring on a developed coastline.

"Sea-trout habitat fragmentation affects threatened freshwater pearl mussel","10.1016/j.biocon.2015.03.016","Martin Österling E., Söderberg H.","Habitat fragmentation is a major reason for the decline and extinction of migratory species. Many host populations for parasites are partly migratory, consisting of both migratory and resident individuals, and we asked the question whether these two subpopulations differ in parasite susceptibility. If so, barriers intercepting migration may change the parasite encystment rate and recruitment. We used the River Ljungan, Sweden, as study system, where eight hydroelectric power plants hinder access of sea-migrating trout to most tributaries. We compared the encystment of the threatened freshwater pearl mussel (. Margaritifera margaritifera) larvae on sympatric tributary-resident brown trout and sea-migrating trout (. Salmo trutta) as hosts for their parasitic larvae. We also compared eighteen tributary-resident brown trout populations with the sea-migrating trout as hosts for mussel larvae. Encystment decreased faster over time on the tributary-resident trout than on the sea-migrating trout. Encystment was therefore higher on the sea-migrating trout compared to the tributary-resident trout at the time of excystment of the larvae. Growth of encysted mussel larvae was higher on the sea-migrating trout than on the tributary-resident trout. The natural density of the tributary-resident trout populations was lower than that of the sea-migrating trout in the autumn, when the mussels infest the fish, and in early summer, just before the excystment of juvenile mussels from the fish. Estimations of total numbers of encysted mussel larvae per unit stream area were higher on the sea-migrating trout than the tributary-resident trout in the autumn and in the spring at the time of juvenile mussel excystment. The higher mussel larval growth and the higher encystment on the sea-migrating trout imply that even seemingly healthy tributary mussel populations are reduced because of the habitat fragmentation.

"Generation of a neutral FST baseline for testing local adaptation on gill raker number within and between European whitefish ecotypes in the Baltic Sea basin","10.1111/jeb.12645","Ozerov M.Y., Himberg M., Aykanat T., Sendek D.S., Hägerstrand H., Verliin A., Krause T., Olsson J., Primmer C.R., Vasemägi A.","Divergent selection at ecologically important traits is thought to be a major factor driving phenotypic differentiation between populations. To elucidate the role of different evolutionary processes shaping the variation in gill raker number of European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus sensu lato) in the Baltic Sea basin, we assessed the relationships between genetic and phenotypic variation among and within three whitefish ecotypes (sea spawners, river spawners and lake spawners). To generate expected neutral distribution of FST and to evaluate whether highly variable microsatellite loci resulted in deflated FST estimates compared to less variable markers, we performed population genetic simulations under finite island and hierarchical island models. The genetic divergence observed among (FCT = 0.010) and within (FST = 0.014-0.041) ecotypes was rather low. The divergence in gill raker number, however, was substantially higher between sea and river spawners compared to observed microsatellite data and simulated neutral baseline (PCT &gt; FCT). This suggests that the differences in gill raker number between sea and river spawners are likely driven by divergent natural selection. We also found strong support for divergent selection on gill raker number among different populations of sea spawners (PST &gt; FST), most likely caused by highly variable habitat use and diverse diet. The putative role of divergent selection within lake spawners initially inferred from empirical microsatellite data was not supported by simulated FST distributions. This work provides a first formal test of divergent selection on gill raker number in Baltic whitefish, and demonstrates the usefulness of population genetic simulations to generate informative neutral baselines for PST-FST analyses helping to disentangle the effects of stochastic evolutionary processes from natural selection. © 2015 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.",2015,"baltic sea; divergent selection; european whitefish; fst; gill raker number; microsatellites; pst; population genetic simulation; qst","Article","SCOPUS"
"Transposable elements as agents of rapid adaptation may explain the genetic paradox of invasive species","10.1111/mec.13089","Stapley J., Santure A.W., Dennis S.R.","Rapid adaptation of invasive species to novel habitats has puzzled evolutionary biologists for decades, especially as this often occurs in the face of limited genetic variability. Although some ecological traits common to invasive species have been identified, little is known about the possible genomic/genetic mechanisms that may underlie their success. A common scenario in many introductions is that small founder population sizes will often lead to reduced genetic diversity, but that invading populations experience large environmental perturbations, such as changes in habitat and environmental stress. Although sudden and intense stress is usually considered in a negative context, these perturbations may actually facilitate rapid adaptation by affecting genome structure, organization and function via interactions with transposable elements (TEs), especially in populations with low genetic diversity. Stress-induced changes in TE activity can alter gene action and can promote structural variation that may facilitate the rapid adaptation observed in new environments. We focus here on the adaptive potential of TEs in relation to invasive species and highlight their role as powerful mutational forces that can rapidly create genetic diversity. We hypothesize that activity of transposable elements can explain rapid adaptation despite low genetic variation (the genetic paradox of invasive species), and provide a framework under which this hypothesis can be tested using recently developed and emerging genomic technologies. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2015,"evolutionary genetics; genomics; introduced species; loci of adaptation; mobile elements; naturalized species; nonfunctional dna","Article","SCOPUS"
"The chimerical genome of Isla del Coco feral pigs (Costa Rica), an isolated population since 1793 but with remarkable levels of diversity","10.1111/mec.13182","Bianco E., Soto H.W., Vargas L., Pérez-Enciso M.","The history of domestic species and of their wild ancestors is not a simple one, and feral processes can clarify key aspects of this history, including the adaptive processes triggered by new environments. Here, we provide a comprehensive genomic study of Isla del Coco (Costa Rica) feral pigs, a unique population that was allegedly founded by two individuals and has remained isolated since 1793. Using SNP arrays and genome sequencing, we show that Cocos pigs are hybrids between Asian and European pigs, as are modern international pig breeds. This conclusively shows that, as early as the 18th century, British vessels were loading crossbred pigs in Great Britain and transporting them overseas. We find that the Y chromosome has Asian origin, which has not been reported in any international pig breed. Chinese haplotypes seem to have been transmitted independently between Cocos and other pig breeds, suggesting independent introgression events and a complex pattern of admixing. Although data are compatible with a founder population of N = 2, variability levels are as high in Cocos pigs as in international pig breeds (∼1.9 SNPs/kb) and higher than in European wild boars or local breeds (∼1.7 SNPs/kb). Nevertheless, we also report a 10-Mb region with a marked decrease in variability across all samples that contains four genes (CPE, H3F3C, SC4MOL and KHL2) previously identified as highly differentiated between wild and domestic pigs. This work therefore illustrates how feral population genomic studies can help to resolve the history of domestic species and associated admixture events. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2015,"adaptation; conservation genetics; genomics; inbreeding; pig; population genetics","Article","SCOPUS"

Due to their short generation time and large reproductive output, parasites are commonly believed to be ahead in this race, although increasing evidence exists that parasites are not always ahead in the arms race - in part owing to evolutionary lineage and recent ecological history. We assess local adaptation of hosts and parasites, and determine whether adaptation was influenced by ecological or evolutionary history, using full reciprocal cross-infections of four Gyrodactylus ectoparasite populations and their four guppy (. Poecilia reticulata) host populations in Trinidad. To consider effects of evolutionary lineage and recent ecology, these four populations were collected from two different river drainages (Marianne and Aripo) and two different predation environments (high and low). The highest infection levels were obtained when parasites from the Aripo lineage infected guppies from the Marianne lineage, indicating a higher infectivity, virulence and/or reproductive success of the Aripo parasites. Aripo lineage guppies were also better able to limit Gyrodactylus population growth than guppies from the Marianne River, indicating their strong ""resistance"" to Gyrodactylus regardless of the source of the parasite. Predation environment had no detectable influence on host-parasite population dynamics of sympatric or allopatric combinations. The much stronger effect of evolutionary lineage (i.e., river) than recent ecological history (i.e., predation) emphasises its importance in driving co-evolutionary dynamics, and should be explored further in future studies on local host-parasite adaptation. © 2015 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.",2015,"ecological history; evolutionary lineage; gyrodactylus; host-parasite coevolution; local adaptation; poecilia reticulata","Article","SCOPUS"
"Foreseeable global warming will differentially affect Chara vulgaris populations from different altitudes","10.1016/j.aquabot.2014.12.002","Rojo C., Martínez-Ruiz C., Carramiñana M., Rodrigo M.A.","A 2-4°C increase in temperature is foreseen for the Mediterranean region by the end of the 21st century due to climate change. This warming is expected to occur as heat waves, and will be particularly important for shallow water bodies which are the main freshwater ecosystems in the Mediterranean. We subjected four populations of Chara vulgaris to a common garden experiment. Each population came from locations at different altitudes, hence living at different mean temperatures. Individual charophyte cultures were initiated with specimens from four origins and acclimatized at 20°C in a controlled environment for 3 weeks. After this, all the populations were incubated under 3 water temperature treatments: 20°C (control), 22°C and 24°C. A two-way ANOVA (temperature. ×. population origin) showed that the temperature treatment significantly, and positively, affected the growth calculated on normalized dry weight, the length of the main axis, the number of branches per node, the horizontal biomass distribution and the respiration rate. Moreover, a significant effect of the temperature. ×. population-origin interaction was detected for biomass production, total length and branch production. These results suggest that lower-altitude populations have a greater tolerance to temperature increase, and they would be favored by climate change.

"Establishing the evolutionary compatibility of potential sources of colonizers for overfished stocks: A population genomics approach","10.1111/mec.13046","Gonçalves Da Silva A., Appleyard S.A., Upston J.","Identifying fish stock structure is fundamental to pinpoint stocks that might contribute colonizers to overfished stocks. However, a stock's potential to contribute to rebuilding hinges on demographic connectivity, a challenging parameter to measure. With genomics as a new tool, fisheries managers can detect signatures of natural selection and thus identify fishing areas likely to contribute evolutionarily compatible colonizers to an overfished area (i.e. colonizers that are not at a fitness disadvantage in the overfished area and able to reproduce at optimal rates). Identifying evolutionarily compatible stocks would help narrow the focus on establishing demographic connectivity where it matters. Here, we genotype 4723 SNPs in 616 orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) across five fishing areas off the Tasmanian coast in Australia. We ask whether these areas form a single genetic unit, and test for signatures of local adaptation. Results from amova, structure, discriminant analysis of principal components, bayesass and isolation by distance suggest that sampled locations are subjected to geneflow amounts that are above what is needed to establish 'drift connectivity'. However, it remains unclear whether there is a single panmictic population or several highly connected populations. Most importantly, we did not find any evidence of local adaptation, suggesting that the examined orange roughy stocks are evolutionarily compatible. The data have helped test an assumption of the orange roughy management programme and to formulate hypotheses regarding stock demographic connectivity. Overall, our results demonstrate the potential of genomics to inform fisheries management, even when evidence for stock structure is sparse. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2015,"conservation; deep-sea; fisheries management; orange roughy; population genomics","Article","SCOPUS"
"Trait dimensionality explains widespread variation in local adaptation","10.1098/rspb.2014.1570","MacPherson A., Hohenlohe P.A., Nuismer S.L.","All species are locked in a continual struggle to adapt to local ecological conditions. In cases where species fail to locally adapt, they face reduced population growth rates, or even local extinction. Traditional explanations for limited local adaptation focus on maladaptive gene flow or homogeneous environmental conditions. These classical explanations have, however, failed to explain variation in the magnitude of local adaptation observed across taxa. Here we show that variable levels of local adaptation are better explained by trait dimensionality. First, we develop and analyse mathematical models that predict levels of local adaptation will increasewith the number of traits experiencing spatially variable selection. Next, we test this prediction by estimating the relationship between dimensionality and local adaptation using data from 35 published reciprocal transplant studies. This analysis reveals a strong correlation between dimensionality and degree of local adaptation, and thus provides empirical support for the predictions of our model. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.",2015,"ecological differentiation; ecological genetics; gene flow; reciprocal transplant; species range; transplant experiment","Article","SCOPUS"

This contribution investigates the use of juvenile freshwater pearl mussels as bioindicators, considering the influence of mussel stock and study stream conditions on juvenile performance, as described by survival and growth rates. A standardized cross experiment was carried out investigating juvenile performance in four different pearl mussel stocks originating from the Rhine, Danube and Elbe drainages, representing distinct genetic conservation units. The juveniles were exposed in five study streams which were selected to integrate pearl mussel streams with different water qualities and recruitment status of the mussel population. Per study stream, five standard mesh cages containing an equal number of 20 (10 × 2) juvenile pearl mussels per stock in separate chambers were installed. Survival and growth rates of juveniles were checked after three months (i.e. before their first winter) and after nine months (i.e. after their first winter). Mussel stock and study stream conditions significantly influenced juvenile performance. Growth rates were determined by study stream conditions and increased with stream water temperature, organic carbon and C/N ratios. Survival rates varied stock-specifically, indicating different levels of local adaptation to their native streams. Due to the detection of stream-specific differences in juvenile performance, freshwater pearl mussels appear suitable as bioindicators. However, a careful consideration of stock-specificity is necessary to avoid false interpretation of bioindication results. The comparison of stock-specific survival in native versus non-native streams implicates that exposure of juveniles outside their native habitats is able to increase breeding success or else serve for risk spreading in breeding programs. © 2014 Elsevier GmbH.",2015,"endangered species; fitness; freshwater mussel conservation; local adaptation; population differentiation","Article","SCOPUS"
"Evidence for bergmann's rule and not allopatric subspeciation in the threatened kaka (nestor meridionalis)","10.5061/dryad.h58cm","Dussex N., Sainsbury J., Moorhouse R., Jamieson I.G., Robertson B.C.","Species of conservation concern characterized by small and declining populations greatly benefit from proactive management approaches such as population translocations. Because they often show intra-specific genetic and phenotypic variation, which can result from drift or differential selective pressures between habitats, understanding the distribution of such variation and its underlying processes is a prerequisite to develop effective management guidelines. Indeed, translocations among genetically differentiated populations potentially locally adapted are discouraged in order to avoid outbreeding depression, while translocations among populations characterized by high gene flow with no evidence for local adaptation are encouraged. Here, we first test whether 2 recognized subspecies, the North Island kaka (Nestor meridionalis septentrionalis) and South Island kaka (Nestor meridionalis meridionalis) of New Zealand fit a scenario of allopatric subspeciation following the separation of the North and South Islands at the end of the Pleistocene using 1 mtDNA (n = 96) and 9 microsatellite markers (n = 126). We then test whether morphological differences among the 2 subspecies support a pattern of local adaptation, comparing phenotypic divergence (PST) and the level of divergence by drift alone (FST) among populations. We find little population structure between islands, ruling out allopatric subspeciation in kaka. Further, PST exceeds FST, supporting an adaptive latitudinal size cline consistent with Bergmann's rule. These results therefore suggest that using neutral genetic diversity alone can be misleading when identifying management units and that the nature of phenotypic variation should be considered in translocations efforts. We finally discuss North and South Island management units but suggest that cross-island translocation be allowed. © 2015 The American Genetic Association.

However, knowledge remains limited about how such effects vary across populations. Here, we investigated whether incubation temperature (26, 28, and 30°C) differentially affects the embryonic development of Asian yellow pond turtle (Mauremys mutica) eggs originating from low-latitude (Guangzhou, 23°06'N) and high-latitude (Haining, 30°19'N) populations in China. At 26°C, the duration of incubation was shorter in the high-latitude population than in the low-latitude population. However, this pattern was reversed at 30°C. As the incubation temperature increased, hatching success increased in the low-latitude population but slightly decreased in the high-latitude population. Hatchlings incubated at 30°C were larger and righted themselves more rapidly than those incubated at 26°C in the low-latitude population. In contrast, hatchling traits were not influenced by incubation temperature in the high-latitude population. Overall, 30°C was a suitable developmental temperature for embryos from the low-latitude population, whereas 26 and 28°C were suitable for those from the high-latitude population. This interpopulation difference in suitable developmental temperatures is consistent with the difference in the thermal environment of the two localities. Therefore, similarly to posthatching individuals, reptile embryos from different populations might have evolved diverse physiological strategies to benefit from the thermal environment in which they develop. © 2014 The Linnean Society of London.",2015,"embryonic response; geographical variation; hatchling size; incubation temperature; local adaptation","Article","SCOPUS"

The distinctive morphological and physiological features of penguins allow them to live an aquatic life, and some of them have successfully adapted to the hostile environments in Antarctica. To study the phylogenetic and population history of penguins and the molecular basis of their adaptations to Antarctica, we sequenced the genomes of the two Antarctic dwelling penguin species, the Adélie penguin [Pygoscelis adeliae] and emperor penguin [Aptenodytes forsteri].Results: Phylogenetic dating suggests that early penguins arose ~60 million years ago, coinciding with a period of global warming. Analysis of effective population sizes reveals that the two penguin species experienced population expansions from ~1 million years ago to ~100 thousand years ago, but responded differently to the climatic cooling of the last glacial period. Comparative genomic analyses with other available avian genomes identified molecular changes in genes related to epidermal structure, phototransduction, lipid metabolism, and forelimb morphology.Conclusions: Our sequencing and initial analyses of the first two penguin genomes provide insights into the timing of penguin origin, fluctuations in effective population sizes of the two penguin species over the past 10 million years, and the potential associations between these biological patterns and global climate change.

The present study aimed to disentangle the effects of isolation-by-distance and isolation-by-environment on genetic differentiation between two sympatric life-history ecotypes. Using 14 microsatellite loci, we first characterized amphidromous and freshwater groups of Cottus asper in a high gene flow setting in the Lower Fraser River system (south-western British Columbia, Canada) to test for the effects of habitat and geographical distance on the distribution of life-history ecotypes. Within the main river channel, no genetic differentiation was found, whereas tributaries even close to the estuary were genetically differentiated. Partial mantel tests confirmed that genetic differentiation between river tributaries and the main channel was independent from geographical distance, with distance-scaled migration rates indicating reduced gene flow from the main channel into the tributaries. Our results suggest that isolation-by-environment can play an important role for the early stage of life-history transitions, and may promote differentiation among life-history ecotypes despite the presence of gene flow. © 2014 The Linnean Society of London.",2014,"amphidromy; isolation-by-ecology; local adaptation; population genetics","Article","SCOPUS"

Effective conservation actions require the delineation of conservation units to appropriately reflect the spatial scale of intraspecific variation and local adaptation. Towards this goal, we used the most comprehensive genetic and genomic database for Atlantic salmon to date, covering the entire North American range of the species. The database included microsatellite data from 9142 individuals from 149 sampling locations and data from a medium-density SNP array providing genotypes for >3000 SNPs for 50 sampling locations. We used neutral and putatively selected loci to integrate adaptive information in the definition of conservation units. Bayesian clustering with the microsatellite data set and with neutral SNPs identified regional groupings largely consistent with previously published regional assessments. The use of outlier SNPs did not result in major differences in the regional groupings, suggesting that neutral markers can reflect the geographic scale of local adaptation despite not being under selection. We also performed assignment tests to compare power obtained from microsatellites, neutral SNPs and outlier SNPs. Using SNP data substantially improved power compared to microsatellites, and an assignment success of 97% to the population of origin and of 100% to the region of origin was achieved when all SNP loci were used. Using outlier SNPs only resulted in minor improvements to assignment success to the population of origin but improved regional assignment.

While some individuals possess the ability to undertake an anadromous marine migration, others remain resident in freshwater throughout their life cycle. Those that will migrate undergo tremendous physiological, morphological, and behavioral transformations in a process called smoltification which transitions freshwater-adapted parr to marine-adapted smolts. While the behavior, ecology, and physiology of smoltification are well described, our understanding of the proximate genetic mechanisms that trigger the process are not well known. Quantitative genetic analyses have identified several genomic regions associated with smoltification and migration-related traits within this species.

Natural plant populations have an extremely poor displacing capacity, so their continued survival in a given environment depends on how well they adapt to local pedoclimatic conditions. Genomic tools can be used to identify adaptive traits at a DNA level and to further our understanding of evolutionary processes. Here we report the use of genotyping-by-sequencing on local groups of the sequenced monocot model species Brachypodium distachyon. Exploiting population genetics, landscape genomics and genome wide association studies, we evaluate B. distachyon role as a natural probe for identifying genomic loci involved in environmental adaptation.Results: Brachypodium distachyon individuals were sampled in nine locations with different ecologies and characterized with 16,697 SNPs. Variations in sequencing depth showed consistent patterns at 8,072 genomic bins, which were significantly enriched in transposable elements. We investigated the structuration and diversity of this collection, and exploited climatic data to identify loci with adaptive significance through i) two different approaches for genome wide association analyses considering climatic variation, ii) an outlier loci approach, and iii) a canonical correlation analysis on differentially sequenced bins. A linkage disequilibrium-corrected Bonferroni method was applied to filter associations. The two association methods jointly identified a set of 15 genes significantly related to environmental adaptation. The outlier loci approach revealed that 5.7% of the loci analysed were under selection. The canonical correlation analysis showed that the distribution of some differentially sequenced regions was associated to environmental variation.Conclusions: We show that the multi-faceted approach used here targeted different components of B. distachyon adaptive variation, and may lead to the discovery of genes related to environmental adaptation in natural populations. Its application to a model species with a fully sequenced genome is a modular strategy that enables the stratification of biological material and thus improves our knowledge of the functional loci determining adaptation in near-crop species. When coupled with population genetics and measures of genomic structuration, methods coming from genome wide association studies may lead to the exploitation of model species as natural probes to identify loci related to environmental adaptation. © 2014 Dell'Acqua et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2014,"adaptation; association mapping; brachypodium distachyon; genotyping by sequencing; gwas; landscape genomics; population genetics","Article","SCOPUS"

As such, the development of long term local adaptation is impossible. However, both plasticity and spatially varying selection have been invoked in explaining how American eel may cope with an unusual broad scope of environmental conditions. Here, we address this question through transcriptomic analyses and genomic reaction norms of eels from two geographic origins reared in controlled environments.Results: The null hypothesis of no difference in gene expression between eels from the two origins was rejected. Many unique transcripts and two out of seven gene clusters showed significant difference in expression, both at time of capture and after three months of common rearing. Differences in expression were observed at numerous genes representing many functional groups when comparing eels from a same origin reared under different salinity conditions. Plastic response to different rearing conditions varied among gene clusters with three clusters showing significant origin-environment interactions translating into differential genomic norms of reaction. Most genes and functional categories showing differences between origins were previously shown to be differentially expressed in a study comparing transcription profiles between adult European eels acclimated to different salinities.Conclusions: These results emphasize that while plasticity in expression may be important, there is also a role for local genetic (and/or epigenetic) differences in explaining differences in gene expression between eels from different geographic origins. Such differences match those reported in genetically distinct populations in other fishes, both in terms of the proportion of genes that are differentially expressed and the diversity of biological functions involved. We thus propose that genetic differences between glass eels of different origins caused by spatially varying selection due to local environmental conditions translates into transcriptomic differences (including different genomic norms of reaction) which may in turn explain part of the phenotypic variance observed between different habitats colonized by eels. © 2014 Côté et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2014,"anguilla; conservation; gene-environment interactions; genomic reaction norm; microarrays; panmixia; plasticity; trancriptome","Article","SCOPUS"

Here, we investigate selection in pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) using genome scans coupled with inference from a haploid-assisted linkage map. Pink salmon have a strict 2-year semelparous life history which has resulted in temporally isolated (allochronic) lineages that remain sympatric through sharing of spawning habitats in alternate years. The lineages differ in a range of adaptive traits, suggesting different genetic backgrounds. We used genotyping by sequencing of haploids to generate a high-density linkage map with 7035 loci and screened an existing panel of 8036 loci for signatures of selection. The linkage map enabled identification of novel genomic regions displaying signatures of parallel selection shared between lineages. Furthermore, 24 loci demonstrated divergent selection and differences in genetic diversity between lineages, suggesting that adaptation in the 2 lineages has arisen from different pools of standing genetic variation.

"Local adaptation and the evolution of chromosome fusions","10.1111/evo.12481","Guerrero R.F., Kirkpatrick M.","We use forward and coalescent models of population genetics to study chromosome fusions that reduce the recombination between two locally adapted loci. Under a continent-island model, a fusion spreads and reaches a polymorphic equilibrium when it causes recombination between locally adapted alleles to be less than their selective advantage. In contrast, fusions in a two-deme model always spread; whether it reaches a polymorphic equilibrium or becomes fixed depends on the relative recombination rates of fused homozygotes and heterozygotes. Neutral divergence around fusion polymorphisms is markedly increased, showing peaks at the point of fusion and at the locally adapted loci. Local adaptation could explain the evolution of many of chromosome fusions, which are some of the most common chromosome rearrangements in nature. © 2014 The Society for the Study of Evolution.",2014,"coalescent; population divergence; rearrangements; recombination; robertsonian translocations; selection","Article","SCOPUS"
"Effects of genetic diversity on conservation and restoration potential at individual, population, and regional scales","10.1016/j.biocon.2014.08.011","Engelhardt K.A.M., Lloyd M.W., Neel M.C.","All available evidence suggests that genetic diversity is important for ecological performance and resilience through the expression and variance of phenotypic traits. Genetic diversity is a multiscalar variable; it includes heterozygosity at the individual scale, genotypic diversity at the population scale, and local adaptation at the regional scale. The three scales of genetic diversity are predominantly studied in isolation to determine conservation status or restoration potential. However, synergisms among the three scales should enhance conservation and restoration assessments. We studied 49 genotypes of Vallisneria americana, a common freshwater submersed aquatic macrophyte that has seen catastrophic declines in its estuarine habitats. Two greenhouse experiments examined phenotypic traits and trade-offs and the effects of genetic diversity on the sustainability of V. americana populations. Clone size, an exploitative guerilla strategy, and plant height, a conservative phalanx strategy, were negatively associated, as were average turion size with clone size and turion abundance, suggesting that growth strategies trade-off to affect plant fitness. Leaf size and turion size were lower in individuals with lower heterozygosity. Early clonal expansion and flowering frequency were enhanced when genotypic richness was higher. Coefficients of variation revealed that opportunities for selection differed across V. americana source beds. We demonstrate that the three scales of genetic diversity work together to determine population performance and evolutionary potential. Thus, integrating the three aspects of genetic diversity is paramount in addressing the impacts of a changing world on the conservation and restoration potential of at-risk populations. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",2014,"freshwater aquatic plants; genotypic diversity; heterozygosity; local adaptation; opportunities for selection; wild celery","Article","SCOPUS"

To investigate the differential responses of populations to changing climatic conditions, we exposed poleward peripheral and central populations of two Lepidoptera to reciprocal, common-garden climatic conditions and compared their whole-transcriptome expression. We found evidence of simple population differentiation in both species, and in the species with previously identified population structure and phenotypic local adaptation, we found several hundred genes that responded in a synchronized and localized fashion. These genes were primarily involved in energy metabolism and oxidative stress, and expression levels were most divergent between populations in the same environment in which we previously detected divergence for metabolism. We found no localized genes in the species with less population structure and for which no local adaptation was previously detected. These results challenge the assumption that species are functionally similar across their ranges and poleward peripheral populations are preadapted to warmer conditions. Rather, some taxa deserve population-level consideration when predicting the effects of climate change because they respond in genetically based, distinctive ways to changing conditions. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2014,"climate; diapause; energy metabolism; lepidoptera; local adaptation; oxidative stress; range shift","Article","SCOPUS"

Phoretic deutonymphs are able to produce a pedicel, a stalk-like temporary attachment structure that connects the mite with the carrier. The aim of our study was to determine whether localization and density of phoretic deutonymphs on the carrier affect pedicel length. The study was conducted on a common phoretic mite - Uropoda orbicularis (Uropodina) and two aphodiid beetles - Aphodius prodromus and Aphodius distinctus. Our results show that pedicel length is influenced by the localization of deutonymphs on the body of the carrier. The longest pedicels are produced by deutonymphs attached to the upper part of elytra, whereas deutonymphs attached to femora and trochanters of the third pair of legs and the apex of elytra construct the shortest pedicels. In general, deutonymphs attached to more exposed parts of the carrier produce longer pedicels, whereas shorter pedicels are produced when deutonymphs are fixed to non-exposed parts of the carrier. A second factor influencing pedicel length is the density of attached deutonymphs. Mean pedicel length and deutonymph densities were highly correlated: higher deutonymph density leads to the formation of longer pedicels. The cause for this correlation is discussed, and we conclude that pedicel length variability can increase successful dispersal. © 2014 The Author(s).",2014,"attachment structures; dung beetles; mites; pedicel; phoresy; uropodina","Article","SCOPUS"

At the molecular level, such processes can be inferred by identifying correlations between genetic variation and environmental variables. We demonstrate that allele length and allele frequency at a regulatory circadian rhythm gene, OtsClock1b, are highly correlated (R2=0.86, P=1.25×10-5) with latitude (a surrogate for photoperiod) in kokanee, the freshwater resident form of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka).

No such associations were detected for neutral microsatellite loci. In addition, a kokanee population sampled from Kamchatka, Russia (55°N) fits within the North American latitudinal cline, suggesting that this pattern may be convergent across large longitudinal spatial scales.

Here, we used next-generation sequencing restriction-associated DNA tags (RAD-seq) and a transcriptome assembled from RNA-seq data to analyse the genetic structure of northwestern Atlantic populations of the low-dispersal intertidal snail Nucella lapillus. Although previous studies in this region have detected almost no genetic structure in N. lapillus, our phylogenomic approach identified a well-supported split between northern and southern clades. By comparing RAD-seq data and our transcriptome assembly, we identified thousands of fixed single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between these latitudinal clades that map to protein-coding genes, including genes associated with heat stress tolerance.

In more-recent analytical methods, the need to assign individuals to populations a priori (clustering algorithms) is relaxed, and spatial autocorrelation analysis of allele frequencies (SA) is used to infer finer-scale and potentially short-term dispersal distances. We applied multiple methods to study the population genetic structure of the riverine caddisfly Stenopsyche marmorata (Trichoptera:Stenopsychidae) from 4 adjacent catchments in northeastern Japan. We genotyped larval individuals (N = 532) from 30 sites at 8 polymorphic microsatellite loci. Fixation indices suggested low levels of genetic differentiation among populations (global F ST = 0.062, p < 0.01), and significant isolation-by-distance (IBD) indicated populations were in drift-migration equilibrium. Bayesian clustering separated S. marmorata into distinct upland (>250 m asl) and lowland populations, with different F ST values (upland F ST = 0.048, p < 0.01; lowland F ST = 0.029, p < 0.01) and significant IBD only among upland populations. Allele frequencies were significantly positively autocorrelated (Moran's I > 0, p < 0.05) at distances up to 18 km along streams and up to 12 km across terrestrial habitat. These values were similar to directly observed flight distance in a single generation for this species in the field. We conclude that the multiple-method approach revealed: 1) unexpected population subdivision between upland and lowland areas that may result from local adaptation, differences in phenology, and historical colonization by multiple lineages; and 2) fine-scale estimates of dispersal that match direct observations of flight and suggest gene flow is more pronounced along water courses in this species. © 2014 by The Society for Freshwater Science.",2014,"aquatic; catchment; freshwater; insect; isolation by distance; river; stream","Article","SCOPUS"

A common difficulty, however, is that programs are founded with limited wild broodstock, and inbreeding can become increasingly difficult to avoid with successive generations in captivity. Program managers must choose between maintaining the genetic purity of populations, at the risk of inbreeding depression, or interbreeding populations, at the risk of outbreeding depression. We evaluate these relative risks in a captive-breeding program for 3 endangered populations of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). In each of 2 years, we released juvenile F1 and F2 interpopulation hybrids, backcrosses, as well as inbred and noninbred within-population crosstypes into 9 wild streams. Juvenile size and survival was quantified in each year. Few crosstype effects were observed, but interestingly, the relative fitness consequences of inbreeding and outbreeding varied from year to year. Temporal variation in environmental quality might have driven some of these annual differences, by exacerbating the importance of maternal effects on juvenile fitness in a year of low environmental quality and by affecting the severity of inbreeding depression differently in different years. Nonetheless, inbreeding was more consistently associated with a negative effect on fitness, whereas the consequences of outbreeding were less predictable. Considering the challenges associated with a sound risk assessment in the wild and given that the effect of inbreeding on fitness is relatively predictable, we suggest that risk can be weighted more strongly in terms of the probable outcome of outbreeding. Factors such as genetic similarities between populations and the number of generations in isolation can sometimes be used to assess outbreeding risk, in lieu of experimentation. © 2014 Society for Conservation Biology.",2014,"cosewic; egg size; environmental quality; hatchery; heterosis; live gene banking; local adaptation; maternal effects; population collapse; population viability","Article","SCOPUS"

For the first time, this was applied to monitor fish assemblages in the Kas Peninsula, Turkey, an area known for its important Lessepsian fish populations. For 3 years (2004, 2007 and 2010), fish assemblages were surveyed using underwater visual census by transect method. A total of 29 species was observed, seven of which were Lessepsian species. Results show a significant increase in the Lessepsian species over the study period. In 2004, they represented 34 % of the total abundance, increasing to >61 % in 2010. Differences were observed in the progression of populations between two invasive herbivores, Siganus rivulatus and Siganus luridus (Siganidae), and two native herbivores, Sparisoma cretense (Scaridae) and Sarpa salpa (Sparidae). The siganids were recorded each year in all sites, whereas S. cretense was regularly observed in fewer numbers, while S. salpa was rarely censused. Abundance of Siganus spp. increased threefold in 6 years while abundances of S. cretense and S. salpa remained stable. S. rivulatus was the most abundant among the four species. Its competitive superiority may be due to its greater adaptability to fluctuating environmental conditions and biological traits, e.g. rapid growth, earlier sexual maturity, high fecundity. Because siganids are herbivorous, their presence can strongly impact algal ecosystems. It is then important to follow their spreading at a large scale, but this can be challenging due to the limited number of scientists.

To uncover the basis of a complex trait like osmoregulation, genome-level analyses are sensible. We combine population genomic scans with genome expression profiling to discover candidate genes and pathways associated with divergence between osmotic environments. We compared transcriptome sequence divergence between multiple freshwater and saltwater populations of the rainwater killifish, Lucania parva. We also compared sequence divergence between L. parva and its sister species, Lucania goodei, a freshwater specialist. We found highly differentiated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between freshwater and saltwater L. parva populations in cell junction and ion transport genes, including V-type H+ ATPase. Between species, we found divergence in reproduction and osmotic stress genes. Genes that were differentially expressed between species during osmotic acclimation included genes involved in ion transport and cell volume regulation. Gene sets that were divergent in coding sequence and divergent in expression did not overlap, although they did converge in function. Like many studies using genomic scans, our approach may miss some loci that contribute to adaptation but have complicated patterns of allelic variation.

"Genetic isolation by environment or distance: Which pattern of gene flow is most common?","10.1111/evo.12258","Sexton J.P., Hangartner S.B., Hoffmann A.A.","Gene flow among populations can enhance local adaptation if it introduces new genetic variants available for selection, but strong gene flow can also stall adaptation by swamping locally beneficial genes. These outcomes can depend on population size, genetic variation, and the environmental context. Gene flow patterns may align with geographic distance (IBD-isolation by distance), whereby immigration rates are inversely proportional to the distance between populations. Alternatively gene flow may follow patterns of isolation by environment (IBE), whereby gene flow rates are higher among similar environments. Finally, gene flow may be highest among dissimilar environments (counter-gradient gene flow), the classic ""gene-swamping"" scenario. Here we survey relevant studies to determine the prevalence of each pattern across environmental gradients. Of 70 studies, we found evidence of IBD in 20.0%, IBE in 37.1%, and both patterns in 37.1%. In addition, 10.0% of studies exhibited counter-gradient gene flow. In total, 74.3% showed significant IBE patterns. This predominant IBE pattern of gene flow may have arisen directly through natural selection or reflect other adaptive and nonadaptive processes leading to nonrandom gene flow.

This study investigated the relative role of isolation by distance (IBD) versus isolation by adaptation (IBA) in explaining population genetic structure in Abies alba and Larix decidua, based on 231 and 233 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) sampled across 36 and 22 natural populations, respectively, in the Alps and Apennines. Genetic structure was investigated for both geographical and environmental groups, using analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA). For each species, nine environmental groups were defined using climate variables selected from a multiple factor analysis. Complementary methods were applied to identify outliers based on these groups, and to test for IBD versus IBA. AMOVA showed weak but significant genetic structure for both species, with higher values in L. decidua. Among the potential outliers detected, up to two loci were found for geographical groups and up to seven for environmental groups. A stronger effect of IBD than IBA was found in both species; nevertheless, once spatial effects had been removed, temperature and soil in A. alba, and precipitation in both species, were relevant factors explaining genetic structure.

Here we explore patterns of adaptive and neutral genetic diversity in the disjunct natural populations of Pinus radiata (D. Don) from mainland California. A first-generation common garden of 447 individuals revealed significant differentiation of wood phenotypes among populations (PST), possibly reflecting local adaptation in response to environment. We subsequently screened all trees for genetic diversity at 149 candidate gene single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci for signatures of adaptation. Ten loci were identified as being possible targets of diversifying selection following F ST outlier tests. Multivariate canonical correlation performed on a data set of 444 individuals identified significant covariance between environment, adaptive phenotypes and outlier SNP diversity, lending support to the case for local adaptation suggested from F ST and PST tests. Covariation among discrete sets of outlier SNPs and adaptive phenotypes (inferred from multivariate loadings) with environment are supported by existing studies of candidate gene function and genotype-phenotype association. Canonical analyses failed to detect significant correlations between environment and 139 non-outlier SNP loci, which were applied to estimate neutral patterns of genetic differentiation among populations (F ST 4.3 %). Using this data set, significant hierarchical structure was detected, indicating three populations on the mainland.

Rapid ecological diversification is common in fishes; however, the role of phenotypic plasticity and adaptation to local environments is poorly understood. It is now possible to investigate genetic patterns to make inferences regarding phenotypic traits under selection and possible mechanisms underlying ecotype divergence, particularly where similar novel phenotypes have arisen in multiple independent populations. Here, we employed a bottom-up approach to test for signatures of directional selection associated with divergence of beach- and stream-spawning kokanee, the obligate freshwater form of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Beach- and stream-spawners co-exist in many post-glacial lakes and exhibit distinct reproductive behaviours, life-history traits and spawning habitat preferences. Replicate ecotype pairs across five lakes in British Columbia, Canada were genotyped at 57 expressed sequence tag-linked and anonymous microsatellite loci identified in a previous genome scan. Fifteen loci exhibited signatures of directional selection (high FST outliers), four of which were identified in multiple lakes. However, the lack of parallel genetic patterns across all lakes may be a result of: 1) an inability to detect loci truly under selection; 2) alternative genetic pathways underlying ecotype divergence in this system; and/or 3) phenotypic plasticity playing a formative role in driving kokanee spawning habitat differences. Gene annotations for detected outliers suggest pathogen resistance and energy metabolism as potential mechanisms contributing to the divergence of beach- and stream-spawning kokanee, but further study is required. © 2013 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.",2013,"adaptation; expressed sequence tag-linked microsatellites; life history evolution; population genomics; sockeye salmon","Article","SCOPUS"

Using a medium-density SNP array, we documented genomic diversity and divergence at 2336 genetically mapped loci among three pairs of North American anadromous and freshwater Atlantic salmon populations. Our results show that across the genome, freshwater populations have lower diversity and a smaller proportion of private polymorphism relative to anadromous populations. Moreover, differentiation was more pronounced among freshwater than among anadromous populations at multiple spatial scales, suggesting a large effect of genetic drift in these isolated freshwater populations. Using nonhierarchical and hierarchical genome scans, we identified hundreds of markers spread across the genome that are potentially under divergent selection between anadromous and freshwater populations, but few outlier loci were repeatedly found in all three freshwater-anadromous comparisons. Similarly, a sliding window analysis revealed numerous regions of high divergence that were nonparallel among the three comparisons. These last results show little evidence for the parallel evolution of alleles selected for in freshwater populations, but suggest nonparallel adaptive divergence at many loci of small effects distributed through the genome. Overall, this study emphasizes the important role of genetic drift in driving genome-wide reduction in diversity and divergence in freshwater Atlantic salmon populations and suggests a complex multigenic basis of adaptation to resident and anadromous strategies with little parallelism. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2013,"anadromous; divergence; freshwater; outliers; salmo salar; snp","Article","SCOPUS"

An energy allocation model was fitted to size-age data, and probabilistic maturation reaction norms were estimated from size-age-maturity data. We found that northern populations from colder environments had higher rates of energy acquisition and reproductive investment, an intrinsic tendency to mature earlier, and had smaller asymptotic sizes than southern populations from warmer environments. Consequently, growth rate was higher before maturation but lower after maturation in the north compared to the south. This is opposite to Bergmann's rule according to which slower growth, delayed maturation and larger asymptotic sizes are usually observed at lower temperatures.

"The relative contribution of drift and selection to transcriptional divergence among Babine Lake tributary populations of juvenile rainbow trout","10.1111/jeb.12247","Wellband K.W., Heath D.D.","Fine-scale population structure has been widely described for salmonid populations using neutral genetic markers, but whether that structure reflects adaptive differences among the populations remains of interest to evolutionary biologists and conservation managers alike. The use of transcriptomics to quantify population differences in genetically controlled functional gene expression traits holds promise for investigating this divergence associated with possible local adaptation. We use custom microarrays to characterize population divergence in transcription at functionally relevant (metabolic and immune function) genes among tributary populations of rainbow trout from Babine Lake, BC and compare it to neutral divergence estimated from microsatellite markers. Transcriptional divergence (PST) was determined at resting state and in response to metabolic and immune challenges, two major sources of mortality and thus selective forces on juvenile salmonids. Results indicate that the majority of selected genes [56 genes (65%), 64 genes (63%) and 38 genes (78%) under control, temperature and immune challenges respectively] show transcriptional divergence (PST &gt; FST) that is consistent with the action of divergent selection. Patterns of pairwise PST among populations are inconsistent with evolution by drift. In general, it appears that the magnitude and pattern of population divergence in transcription reflect the action of natural selection and identify selection on transcription as a mechanism for local adaptation. These results reinforce the need to conserve salmonids on a tributary basis and provide insight into genetic mechanisms that facilitate local adaptation. © 2013 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.",2013,"gene expression; genetic structuring; local adaptation; microarray","Article","SCOPUS"

Using local stock reduces the chances of outbreeding depression or genetic dilution, whereas mixing sources may increase diversity and counteract inbreeding depression. Evaluation of these opposing approaches remains difficult when planning a restoration project but is needed to increase chances of long-term population persistence. We evaluated seed production and germination success of seeds from controlled reproductive crosses of the submersed aquatic plant Vallisneria americana (wild celery) collected from populations throughout the Chesapeake Bay. We assessed differences in seeds, capsules, and germination success in three types of crosses: (1) individuals within-populations, (2) among-populations but within-genetically differentiated regions, and (3) among-regions. We observed population level differences in within-population and among-region crosses. Levels of genetic relatedness among individuals, genetic diversity within populations, or differentiation across populations did not predict reproductive success. Our data show that mixing sources from different populations and regions has both benefits and drawbacks. Thus, minimizing the risks of outbreeding and inbreeding depression, presented as a mostly dichotomous issue in the restoration literature, is not an either-or issue in V. americana. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",2013,"chesapeake bay; inbreeding; local adaptation; plant population restoration; relatedness; submersed aquatic vegetation","Article","SCOPUS"
"Microgeographic maladaptive performance and deme depression in response to roads and runoff","10.7717/peerj.163","Brady S.P.","Despite theoretical understanding and empirical detection of local adaptation in natural environments, our knowledge of such divergence in fragmented habitats remains limited, especially in the context of microgeographic spatial scales and contemporary time scales. I used a combination of reciprocal transplant and common garden exposure experiments to evaluate potential microgeographic divergence in a pool-breeding amphibian occupying a landscape fragmented by roads. As indicated by reduced rates of survival and increased rates of malformation, I found evidence for maladaptation in road adjacent populations. This response is in direct counterpoint to recently described local adaption by a cohabiting species of amphibian. These results suggest that while divergence might commonly follow habitat modification, the direction of its outcome cannot be generalized even in identical habitats. Further, maladaptive responses can be associated with a more generalized depression effect that transcends the local environment. Alongside recent reports, these results suggest that maladaptive responses may be an emerging consequence of human-induced environmental change.

"Local adaptation when competition depends on phenotypic similarity","10.1111/evo.12176","Burgess S.C., Waples R.S., Baskett M.L.","Recent work incorporating demographic-genetic interactions indicates the importance of population size, gene flow, and selection in influencing local adaptation. This work typically assumes that density-dependent survival affects individuals equally, but individuals in natural population rarely compete equally. Among-individual differences in resource use generate stronger competition between more similar phenotypes (frequency-dependent competition) but it remains unclear how this additional form of selection changes the interactions between population size, gene flow, and local stabilizing selection. Here, we integrate migration-selection dynamics with frequency-dependent competition. We developed a coupled demographic-quantitative genetic model consisting of two patches connected by dispersal and subject to local stabilizing selection and competition. Our model shows that frequency-dependent competition slightly increases local adaptation, greatly increases genetic variance within patches, and reduces the amount that migration depresses population size, despite the increased genetic variance load. The effects of frequency-dependence depend on the strength of divergent selection, trait heritability, and when mortality occurs in the life cycle in relation to migration and reproduction. Essentially, frequency-dependent competition reduces the density-dependent interactions between migrants and residents, the extent to which depends on how different and common immigrants are compared to residents. Our results add new dynamics that illustrate how competition can alter the effects of gene flow and divergent selection on local adaptation and population carrying capacities. © 2013 The Author(s).

However, the genetic underpinnings, as well as the scale and magnitude at which this differentiation occurs in marine habitats are not well understood. We investigated the patterns and degree of genomic heterogeneity in threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) by assessing genetic variability in 20 nongenic and 20 genic (associated with genes important for freshwater adaptation) microsatellite loci in samples collected from 38 locations spanning the entire Baltic Sea coast to the North Sea boundary. Population divergence (FST ≈ 0.026) and structuring (five genetic clusters) was significantly more pronounced in the genic as compared to nongenic markers (FST ≈ 0.008; no genetic clusters). Patterns of divergence in the genic markers-45% of which were identified as outliers-correlated with local differences in salinity. Yet, a strong positive correlation between divergence in genic and nongenic markers, and their association with environmental factors suggests that adaptive divergence is reducing gene flow across the genome. Apart from providing a clear demonstration of heterogeneous genomic patterns of differentiation in a marine species, the results are indicative of adaptive population structuring across the relatively young Baltic Sea in spite of ample opportunities for gene flow. © 2013 The Society for the Study of Evolution.",2013,"adaptation; baltic sea; gene flow; microsatellite; population differentiation; seascapes genetics","Article","SCOPUS"

Thus, debates persist about the rate, magnitude, and causes of genomic change. This special section is devoted to helping resolve these debates. The eight studies contained within demonstrate how we can begin to move away from vague metaphors toward quantitative and more precise descriptors of patterns of genetic architecture and divergence. However, a particular genomic pattern can often arise via different combinations of various processes such as selection, gene flow, recombination, mutation, genetic drift, and demographic variability. Thus, substantial challenges remain in elucidating which evolutionary processes generated observed genomic patterns. Nonetheless, the studies in this section demonstrate ways forward toward bridging pattern and process, including experimental work, genetic mapping, increased knowledge of natural history and demography, and comparative studies spanning taxa at different points in the speciation continuum.

We investigated, at two nested spatial scales (35 and 7 km), genetic structure among populations of the infaunal tellinid bivalve Macoma balthica. The COI mitochondrial marker revealed a likely mix of evolutionary lineages in the Gulf, with no detectable spatial structure. Seven microsatellite markers detected weak population structure, separating deep and shallow populations within short distances (7 km) and assignment tests suggested asymmetric gene flow among these populations, with no shallow recruits being detected in deep waters.

One approach to examining population responses to disturbance in species with complex life histories is to study species that exhibit spatial patterns in their phenotypic response across populations or demes. In this study, we investigate a threatened population of fall chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in the Snake River of Idaho, in which a significant fraction of the juvenile population have been shown to exhibit a yearling out-migration strategy which had not previously been thought to exist. It has been suggested that dam-related environmental changes may have altered the selective pressures experienced by out-migrating fall chinook, driving evolution of a later and more selectively advantageous migration strategy. Using isotopic analysis of otoliths from returning adult spawners, we reconstructed the locations of individual fish at three major juvenile life stages to determine if the representation of the yearling life history was geographically structured within the population. We reconstructed juvenile locations for natal, rearing and overwintering life stages in each of the major spawning areas in the basin. Our results indicate that the yearling life-history strategy is predominantly represented within one of the main spawning regions, the Clearwater River, rather than being distributed throughout the basin. Previous studies have shown the Clearwater River to have cooler temperatures, later hatch dates, and later outmigration of juveniles, indicating a link between environment and expression of the yearling life history. Our data suggest that this new yearling life history may be disproportionally represented in returning adult spawners, indicating selection for this life history within the population. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",2013,"chinook salmon; juvenile migration; local adaptation; otolith microchemistry; phenotypic plasticity","Article","SCOPUS"

Such differences could have origins in acclimation or in genetically fixed variation between habitats. Here we use common-garden experiments to evaluate differences in gene expression between populations of the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, spanning 1700 km and average temperature differences of 5°C to 8°C. Across expression profiles from 18,883 genes after 3 years of common conditions, we find highly correlated expression patterns (Pearson's r = 0.992) among most genes. However, 66 genes were differentially expressed, including many ribosomal protein and biomineralization genes, which had higher expression in urchins originally from the southern population. Gene function analyses revealed slight but pervasive expression differences in genes related to ribosomal function, metabolism, transport, ""bone"" development, and response to stimuli. In accord with gene expression patterns, a post-hoc spine regrowth experiment revealed that urchins of southern origin regrew spines at a faster rate than northern urchins.

Triggered by environmental cues, populations produce resting eggs that allow them to survive temporally unsuitable conditions. Daphnia magna is a crustacean that reproduces by cyclical parthenogenesis, alternating between the production of asexual offspring and the sexual reproduction of diapausing eggs (ephippia). Prior to ephippia production, males (necessary to ensure ephippia fertilization) are produced parthenogenetically. Both the production of ephippia and the parthenogenetic production of males are induced by environmental factors. Here, we test the hypothesis that the induction of D. magna resting egg production shows a signature of local adaptation. We postulated that Daphnia from permanent ponds would produce fewer ephippia and males than Daphnia from intermittent ponds and that the frequency and season of habitat deterioration would correlate with the timing and amount of male and ephippia production. To test this, we quantified the production of males and ephippia in clonal D. magna populations in several different controlled environments. We found that the production of both ephippia and males varies strongly among populations in a way that suggests local adaptation. By performing quantitative trait locus mapping with parent clones from contrasting pond environments, we identified nonoverlapping genomic regions associated with male and ephippia production. As the traits are influenced by two different genomic regions, and both are necessary for successful resting egg production, we suggest that the genes for their induction co-evolve. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2013,"daphnia magna; local adaptation; male production; quantitative trait locus mapping; resting eggs","Article","SCOPUS"
"Genetic history of a colonizing population: Drosophila buzzatii (Diptera: Drosophilidae) in Australia","10.1111/bij.12067","Barker J.S.F.","Drosophila buzzatiiPatterson & Wheeler, a cactophilic species that feeds and breeds in the rotting tissues of various Opuntia cactus species, was inadvertently introduced to Australia from Argentina sometime during the period 1931-1936. After a bottleneck at introduction, its spread through the cactus distribution was probably very rapid as a result of natural dispersal from the site of introduction and from three other foci colonized from the introduction site by human intervention. By 1940, the Opuntia distribution and consequently that of D.buzzatii was reduced to spatially isolated populations, with probable further bottlenecking of at least some of the D.buzzatii populations. Allozyme data (primarily six polymorphic loci) from flies collected during April 1972 to February 1996 at 67 localities were used to examine current population differentiation and relationships, as well as to infer aspects of their demographic history. Although there is significant isolation-by-distance, genetic relationships among the populations are not simply related to geographical distance, implying that genetic drift has contributed to population differentiation. However, the biotic and, to an extent, the physical environment are not the same in Australia as in Argentina. Consequently, exposure to novel environments has led to local adaptation and further population differentiation. Genetic variation and the structure of Australian populations apparently are determined by founder effects (drift) at the level of individual breeding sites (cactus rots), by diversifying selection among rots within a locality, as well as by drift and geographically varying selection among localities.© 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 109, 682-698. © 2013 The Linnean Society of London.",2013,"adaptation; allozymes; demographic inferences; genetic differentiation; genetic drift; novel environments; range expansion; selection","Article","SCOPUS"
"Genomic signatures of relaxed disruptive selection associated with speciation reversal in whitefish","10.1186/1471-2148-13-108","Hudson A.G., Vonlanthen P., Bezault E., Seehausen O.","Background: Speciation reversal: the erosion of species differentiation via an increase in introgressive hybridization due to the weakening of previously divergent selection regimes, is thought to be an important, yet poorly understood, driver of biodiversity loss. Our study system, the Alpine whitefish (Coregonus spp.) species complex is a classic example of a recent postglacial adaptive radiation: forming an array of endemic lake flocks, with the independent origination of similar ecotypes among flocks. However, many of the lakes of the Alpine radiation have been seriously impacted by anthropogenic nutrient enrichment, resulting in a collapse in neutral genetic and phenotypic differentiation within the most polluted lakes. Here we investigate the effects of eutrophication on the selective forces that have shaped this radiation, using population genomics. We studied eight sympatric species assemblages belonging to five independent parallel adaptive radiations, and one species pair in secondary contact. We used AFLP markers, and applied F§ssub§ST§ esub§ outlier (BayeScan, Dfdist) and logistic regression analyses (MatSAM), to identify candidate regions for disruptive selection in the genome and their associations with adaptive traits within each lake flock. The number of outlier and adaptive trait associated loci identified per lake were then regressed against two variables (historical phosphorus concentration and contemporary oxygen concentration) representing the strength of eutrophication. Results: Whilst we identify disruptive selection candidate regions in all lake flocks, we find similar trends, across analysis methods, towards fewer disruptive selection candidate regions and fewer adaptive trait/candidate loci associations in the more polluted lakes. Conclusions: Weakened disruptive selection and a concomitant breakdown in reproductive isolating mechanisms in more polluted lakes has lead to increased gene flow between coexisting Alpine whitefish species. We hypothesize that the resulting higher rates of interspecific recombination reduce either the number or extent of genomic islands of divergence surrounding loci evolving under disruptive natural selection. This produces the negative trend seen in the number of selection candidate loci recovered during genome scans of whitefish species flocks, with increasing levels of anthropogenic eutrophication: as the likelihood decreases that AFLP restriction sites will fall within regions of heightened genomic divergence and therefore be classified as F§ssub§ST§esub§ outlier loci.

Yet unexplained findings of within-region population genetic heterogeneity coupled with the morphological and behavioural diversity described for the species suggest that adaptive genetic variation underlying fitness traits may be responsible. We employed restriction site-associated DNA sequencing to genotype 4439 quality filtered single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci for 518 individuals collected across a broad geographical area including British Columbia, Washington, Oregon and California. A subset of putatively neutral markers (N = 4068) identified a significant amount of variation among three broad populations: northern British Columbia, Columbia River/southern coast and 'dwarf' adults (FCT = 0.02, P ≪ 0.001). Additionally, 162 SNPs were identified as adaptive through outlier tests, and inclusion of these markers revealed a signal of adaptive variation related to geography and life history. The majority of the 162 adaptive SNPs were not independent and formed four groups of linked loci. Analyses with matsam software found that 42 of these outlier SNPs were significantly associated with geography, run timing and dwarf life history, and 27 of these 42 SNPs aligned with known genes or highly conserved genomic regions using the genome browser available for sea lamprey.

Across the 600 km region, adult abundance, recruitment and fecundity all declined towards the range limit, but only adult abundance and recruitment were positively correlated, suggesting that recruitment is negatively affected at the range limit and that recruitment plays a significant role in setting the geographical patterns of abundance of T. rosea. In contrast, at smaller spatial scales within this region, adult abundance and recruitment varied by up to 15- and 100-fold, respectively, among some locations only tens of kilometres apart, and no obvious patterns in adult-recruit relationships were revealed towards the range limit.

"Detection experiments with humans implicate visual predation as a driver of colour polymorphism dynamics in pygmy grasshoppers","10.1186/1472-6785-13-17","Karpestam E., Merilaita S., Forsman A.","Background: Animal colour patterns offer good model systems for studies of biodiversity and evolution of local adaptations. An increasingly popular approach to study the role of selection for camouflage for evolutionary trajectories of animal colour patterns is to present images of prey on paper or computer screens to human 'predators'. Yet, few attempts have been made to confirm that rates of detection by humans can predict patterns of selection and evolutionary modifications of prey colour patterns in nature. In this study, we first analyzed encounters between human 'predators' and images of natural black, grey and striped colour morphs of the polymorphic Tetrix subulata pygmy grasshoppers presented on background images of unburnt, intermediate or completely burnt natural habitats. Next, we compared detection rates with estimates of capture probabilities and survival of free-ranging grasshoppers, and with estimates of relative morph frequencies in natural populations.Results: The proportion of grasshoppers that were detected and time to detection depended on both the colour pattern of the prey and on the type of visual background. Grasshoppers were detected more often and faster on unburnt backgrounds than on 50% and 100% burnt backgrounds. Striped prey were detected less often than grey or black prey on unburnt backgrounds; grey prey were detected more often than black or striped prey on 50% burnt backgrounds; and black prey were detected less often than grey prey on 100% burnt backgrounds. Rates of detection mirrored previously reported rates of capture by humans of free-ranging grasshoppers, as well as morph specific survival in the wild. Rates of detection were also correlated with frequencies of striped, black and grey morphs in samples of T. subulata from natural populations that occupied the three habitat types used for the detection experiment.Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that crypsis is background-dependent, and implicate visual predation as an important driver of evolutionary modifications of colour polymorphism in pygmy grasshoppers.

Comparison of closely related and geographically overlapping species can be particularly useful in cases where landscape may similarly influence genetic structure. Congruent patterns among species highlight the importance that landscape heterogeneity plays in determining genetic structure whereas contrasting patterns emphasize differences in species-specific ecology and life-history or the importance of species-specific adaptation to local environments. We examined the interacting roles of demography and adaptation in determining spatial genetic structure in two closely related and geographically overlapping species in a pristine environment. Using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci exhibiting both neutral and putative adaptive variation, we evaluated the genetic structure of sockeye salmon in the Copper River, Alaska; these data were compared to existing data for Chinook salmon from the same region. Overall, both species exhibited patterns of isolation by distance; the spatial distribution of populations largely determined the distribution of genetic variation across the landscape. Further, both species exhibited largely congruent patterns of within- and among-population genetic diversity, highlighting the role that landscape heterogeneity and historical processes play in determining spatial genetic structure.

In lakes on the Haida Gwaii archipelago (off western Canada), stickleback have undergone a remarkable local radiation and show phenotypic diversity matching that seen throughout the species distribution. To provide a historical context for this radiation, we surveyed genetic variation at >1000 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci in stickleback from over 100 populations. SNPs included markers evenly distributed throughout genome and candidate SNPs tagging adaptive genomic regions. Based on evenly distributed SNPs, the phylogeographic pattern differs substantially from the disjunct pattern previously observed between two highly divergent mtDNA lineages. The SNP tree instead shows extensive within watershed population clustering and different watersheds separated by short branches deep in the tree. These data are consistent with separate colonizations of most watersheds, despite underlying genetic connections between some independent drainages. This supports previous suppositions that morphological diversity observed between watersheds has been shaped independently, with populations exhibiting complete loss of lateral plates and giant size each occurring in several distinct clades. Throughout the archipelago, we see repeated selection of SNPs tagging candidate freshwater adaptive variants at several genomic regions differentiated between marine-freshwater populations on a global scale (e.g. EDA, Na/K ATPase).

"Despite prolonged association in closed populations, an intertidal predator does not prefer abundant local prey to novel prey","10.1111/bij.12007","Mcwilliam R.A., Minchinton T.E., Ayre D.J.","The diets of predators should reflect interactions between their behavioural and anatomical constraints and the availability and accessibility of prey, although feeding preferences may also reflect adaptation to locally abundant prey, particularly in closed populations. On the south-east coast of Australia, the whelk Haustrum vinosum (Lamarck, 1822) and its prey communities provide a model system in which to test the effect of variation in prey availability on diet and dietary preferences. Haustrum vinosum is a direct developing species, forming effectively closed populations, with the potential for local adaptation at local and regional scales. Here we show that populations of whelks east and west of a biogeographical barrier encounter different prey assemblages, and have different feeding patterns and apparent prey preferences. We then use a prey choice experiment to test for evidence that H.vinosum from three populations west of the barrier display an inherent preference for its most frequently encountered western prey species, the mussel Brachidontes rostratus (Dunker, 1857), over a novel prey, the barnacle Tesseropora rosea (Krauss, 1848). We detected no prey preference within any population, suggesting past association with B.rostratus did not influence prey selection. Our data support the hypothesis that predators with limited dispersal and high population differentiation are able to maintain flexible generalist foraging patterns, even when they encounter novel prey. © 2013 The Linnean Society of London.",2013,"biogeographical barrier; direct development; muricidae; predation; prey; rocky intertidal; whelk","Article","SCOPUS"
"Individual and among-population variation in dispersal-related traits in Natterjack toads","10.1093/beheco/ars193","Maes J., Van Damme R., Matthysen E.","Recent publications on animal conservation called out the need to account for individual and among-population differences in dispersal. Despite the demonstrated links between personality traits and dispersal behavior, most studies of local adaptation have focused on dispersal capacity through variation in morphology and physiology. Ephemeral habitat patches generally favor dispersal capacity, whereas loss and increasing isolation of the patches can select against dispersal capacity. In this study, we explore whether populations of Natterjack toads (Bufo calamita) have evolved different morphologies, physiological performance and personality traits in response to the spatial arrangement of their habitat. First, we studied the consistency and intercorrelations of behavioral traits in order to test for the possible existence of personality, which so far has been largely ignored in the study of amphibians. Second, we assessed levels of population differentiation in candidate personality traits and dispersal capacity. The toadlets in this study originated from populations with different degrees of isolation, due to distance from other populations and resistance of the surrounding landscape, and with different dynamics of the subpopulations. We used two cohorts of toadlets, one raised in a common environment and the other collected in the field. We found consistency and correlations between the behavioral measurements, suggesting the possible existence of personality linked to mobility. The higher locomotor performance in toadlets from the metapopulations in the low-resistance landscape compared with those from the isolated populations indicates local adaptation in dispersal capacity. Yet, we could not demonstrate that differences in behavior can be explained by local adaptation in dispersalrelated traits. © The Author 2012.",2013,"behavioral syndrome; bufo calamita; dispersal capacity; personality; population differentiation","Article","SCOPUS"
"Adaptation at range margins: Common garden trials and the performance of Arabidopsis lyrata across its northwestern European range","10.1111/nph.12060","Vergeer P., Kunin W.E.","Widely distributed species, such as the perennial plant Arabidopsis lyrata, face a range of environmental conditions across space, creating selective pressures for local evolutionary adaptation. The species' fragmented distribution may reduce gene flow, which could either reduce or increase adaptive potential. The substantial variation in phenotypic traits observed across this species' northwestern European range may reflect a combination of plastic responses to environmental conditions, evolutionary adaptation and nonadaptive genetic differentiation. We conducted multi-site common garden experiments to study differences in plant performance in core and marginal areas. Plants from eight source populations representing the species' full geographic and altitudinal range in northwestern Europe were planted out in Iceland, Sweden, Scotland and Wales. We found evidence of both strong plastic responses and apparently adaptive differentiation in performance. Most evidence for local adaptation was found at range margins, with the strongest effects on reproductive output. Both biotic and abiotic factors affected performance, especially at range margins. Performance of most plants was best in the Scottish and Swedish common garden sites, in the core of the species' distribution. Despite adaptations at range margins, the performance of the species declines at distributional limits, with extreme southern populations looking particularly vulnerable. © 2012 The Authors.

The distribution patterns of European bat species differ between species. In this paper we seek to explain which life history traits, or interrelations between traits, can best explain observed differences in the distribution patterns of bats. Traits are interrelated and sometimes involve trade-offs, implying that a change in one trait may have positive or negative consequences for other traits. We describe the main morphological, physiological and ecological adaptations of insectivorous European bat species. We make pair-wise relations between traits, indicating the interrelations between traits, in terms of possible trade-offs.We relate the consequences of these trade-offs to the distribution maps of the species, focusing on the traits relevant for southern and northern distribution limits.We found coarse patterns that might indicate the distribution of related species are a consequence of their physiological, morphological and ecological adaptations and the interrelations between these adaptations. Hence, we think life-history strategies can be used to explain differences in species distribution.

"Specific-gene studies of evolutionary mechanisms in an age of genome-wide surveying","10.1111/nyas.12139","Watt W.B.","The molecular tools of genomics have great power to reveal patterns of genetic difference within or among species, but must be complemented by the mechanistic study of the genetic variants found if these variants' evolutionary meaning is to be well understood. Central to this purpose is knowledge of the organisms' genotype-phenotype-environment interactions, which embody biological adaptation and constraint and thus drive natural selection. The history of this approach is briefly reviewed. Strategies embracing the complementarity of genomics and specific-gene studies in evolution are considered. Implementation of these strategies, and examples showing their feasibility and power, are discussed. Initial generalizations emphasize: (1) reproducibility of adaptive mechanisms; (2) evolutionary co-importance of variation in protein sequences and expression; (3) refinement of rudimentary molecular functions as an origin of evolutionary innovations; (4) identification of specific-gene mechanisms as underpinnings of genomic or quantitative genetic variation; and (5) multiple forms of adaptive or constraining epistasis among genes.

We present a case-study from over 100years of data for the endemic landlocked Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar, Salmonidae) and brown trout (Salmo trutta, Salmonidae) in Lake Vänern, Sweden. We use this case-study to develop life history-based research and monitoring priorities for migratory salmonids. In Vänern, small wild populations of salmon and trout remain only in the heavily regulated Rivers Klar (Klarälven) and Gullspång (Gullspångsälven), and commercial and sport fisheries are maintained by hatchery stocking. These populations represent some of the last remaining large-bodied (up to 20kg) landlocked salmon stocks worldwide. We found that one of four stocks of wild fish has increased since 1996; the other three remain critically low. Hatchery return rates for three of four stocks appear stable at roughly 1% and annual fisheries catch is roughly 75metric tons, with an estimated 7.5% of hatchery smolts being recruited to the fishery; this also appears relatively stable since 1990. Our analysis reveals much uncertainty in key data requirements, including both river return and fisheries catch rates, estimates of wild smolt production and survival, and hatchery breeding and genetics protocols. These uncertainties, coupled with a lack of information on their riverine and lacustrine ecology, preclude effective management of these unique populations. We conclude with a framework for a life history-based approach to research and monitoring for Vänern salmon and trout, which should be applicable for all endemic, migratory salmonid populations. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",2012,"atlantic salmon; brown trout; life history-based management; local adaptation; salmonid conservation","Article","SCOPUS"
"Unravelling genetics at the top: Mountain islands or isolated belts?","10.1093/aob/mcs195","García-Fernández A., Segarra-Moragues J.G., Widmer A., Escudero A., Iriondo J.M.","Background and AimsIn mountain plant populations, local adaptation has been described as one of the main responses to climate warming, allowing plants to persist under stressful conditions. This is especially the case for marginal populations at their lowest elevation, as they are highly vulnerable. Adequate levels of genetic diversity are required for selection to take place, while high levels of altitudinal gene flow are seen as a major limiting factor potentially precluding local adaptation processes. Thus, a compromise between genetic diversity and gene flow seems necessary to guarantee persistence under oncoming conditions. It is therefore critical to determine if gene flow occurs preferentially between mountains at similar altitudinal belts, promoting local adaptation at the lowest populations, or conversely along altitude within each mountain.MethodsMicrosatellite markers were used to unravel genetic diversity and population structure, inbreeding and gene flow of populations at two nearby altitudinal gradients of Silene ciliata, a Mediterranean high-mountain cushion plant.Key ResultsGenetic diversity and inbreeding coefficients were similar in all populations. Substantial gene flow was found both along altitudinal gradients and horizontally within each elevation belt, although greater values were obtained along altitudinal gradients. Gene flow may be responsible for the homogeneous levels of genetic diversity found among populations. Bayesian cluster analyses also suggested that shifts along altitudinal gradients are the most plausible scenario.ConclusionsPast population shifts associated with glaciations and interglacial periods in temperate mountains may partially explain current distributions of genetic diversity and population structure. In spite of the predominance of gene flow along the altitudinal gradients, local genetic differentiation of one of the lower populations together with the detection of one outlier locus might support the existence of different selection forces at low altitudes. © 2012 The Author.",2012,"altitudinal range; caryophyllaceae; gene flow; genetic variation; glacial refuge; local adaptation; mountain plant; silene ciliata","Article","SCOPUS"

Neutral genetic variation is often assumed to reflect variation in quantitative traits under selection, though with even low neutral divergence there can be substantial differentiation in quantitative genetic variation associated with locally adapted phenotypes. To study the relative roles of natural selection and genetic drift in shaping phenotypic variation, the levels of quantitative divergence based on phenotypes (P ST) and neutral genetic divergence (F ST) can be compared. Such a comparison was made between 10 populations of Finnish House Sparrows (n = 238 individuals) collected in 2009 across the whole country. Phenotypic variation in tarsus-length, wing-length, bill-depth, bill-length and body mass were considered and 13 polymorphic microsatellite loci were analysed to quantify neutral genetic variation. Calculations of P ST were based on Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Bayesian estimates of phenotypic variances across and within populations. The robustness of the conclusions of the P ST-F ST comparison was evaluated by varying the proportion of variation due to additive genetic effects within and across populations. Our results suggest that body mass is under directional selection, whereas the divergence in other traits does not differ from neutral expectations. These findings suggest candidate traits for considering gene-based studies of local adaptation.

Evidence for local adaptation in herbivores with relatively broad host breadth is scarce, either because generalists rarely locally adapt or because fewer studies have tested for local adaptation. The marine isopod Idotea balthica, a small (<3 cm) generalist herbivore common to estuaries of the northwestern Atlantic, is found on multiple macroalgae and sea grasses north of 42°N, while more southerly populations utilize sea grass-dominated and macroalgal-poor habitats. Feeding preference assays revealed a latitudinal shift in preference hierarchy that mirrors this geographic variation in host availability. Northern populations have higher feeding preference for fresh and freeze-dried tissue of the brown macroalga Fucus vesiculosus and consumed more of its water-soluble and lipophilic extracts relative to southern populations. In contrast, southern populations have a relatively higher preference for the green macroalga Ulva linza and sea grass Zostera marina. The rank of hosts in feeding assays exhibited by northern adults (Fucus = Ulva > Zostera) and southern adults (Ulva > Fucus > Zostera) closely mirrored ranking of juvenile growth rates, suggesting that preference and performance are strongly correlated across these macrophytes. Several of our assays included isopods that had parents reared under uniform laboratory conditions, indicating that geographic differences are genetically mediated and unlikely to reflect phenotypic plasticity or maternal effects. Local adaptation in host use traits may be common in broadly distributed, generalist herbivores in marine and terrestrial systems, and will manifest itself as local shifts in the preference ranking of hosts. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",2012,"environmental heterogeneity; fucus vesiculosus; host use; plant chemical defense; plant herbivore interactions; zostera marina","Article","SCOPUS"

Their divergence from the lower-latitude brown bear provides a textbook example of rapid evolution of distinct phenotypes. However, limited mitochondrial and nuclear DNA evidence conflicts in the timing of PB origin as well as placement of the species within versus sister to the brown bear lineage. We gathered extensive genomic sequence data from contemporary polar, brown, and American black bear samples, in addition to a 130,000- to 110,000-y old PB, to examine this problem from a genome-wide perspective. Nuclear DNA markers reflect a species tree consistent with expectation, showing polar and brown bears to be sister species. However, for the enigmatic brown bears native to Alaska's Alexander Archipelago, we estimate that not only their mitochondrial genome, but also 5-10% of their nuclear genome, is most closely related to PBs, indicating ancient admixture between the two species. Explicit admixture analyses are consistent with ancient splits among PBs, brown bears and black bears that were later followed by occasional admixture. We also provide paleodemographic estimates that suggest bear evolution has tracked key climate events, and that PB in particular experienced a prolonged and dramatic decline in its effective population size during the last ca. 500,000 years. We demonstrate that brown bears and PBs have had sufficiently independent evolutionary histories over the last 4-5 million years to leave imprints in the PB nuclear genome that likely are associated with ecological adaptation to the Arctic environment.",2012,"demographic history; hybridization; mammalian genomics; phylogenetics","Article","SCOPUS"

However, most clinal studies of climatic adaptation in Drosophila have involved species that contain cosmopolitan inversion polymorphisms that show clinal patterns themselves, making it difficult to determine whether the traits or inversions are under selection. Further, although climatic selection is unlikely to act on only one life stage in metamorphic organisms, a few studies have examined clinal patterns across life stages. Finally, clinal patterns of heat tolerance may also depend on the assay used. To unravel these potentially confounding effects on clinal patterns of thermal tolerance, we examined adult and larval heat tolerance traits in populations of Drosophila simulans from eastern Australia using static and dynamic (ramping 0.06 °C min-1) assays. We also used microsatellites markers to clarify whether demographic factors or selection are responsible for population differentiation along clines. Significant cubic clinal patterns were observed for adult static basal, hardened and dynamic heat knockdown time and static basal heat survival in larvae. In contrast, static, hardened larval heat survival increased linearly with latitude whereas no clinal association was found for larval ramping survival. Significant associations between adult and larval traits and climatic variables, and low population differentiation at microsatellite loci, suggest a role for climatic selection, rather than demographic processes, in generating these clinal patterns. Our results suggest that adaptation to thermal stress may be species and life-stage specific, complicating our efforts to understand the evolutionary responses to selection for increasing thermotolerance.

"Absence of countergradient and cogradient variation in an oceanic silverside, the California grunion Leuresthes tenuis","10.3354/meps09802","Brown E.E., Baumann H., Conover D.O.","Spatial adaptations that maximize a species' fitness in its local environment, particularly in the form of countergradient variation (CnGV = genotypic influences counteract environmental effects on trait variation) and cogradient variation (CoGV = genotypic influences accentuate environmental plasticity), have been documented in many estuarine and anadromous fishes. However, their prevalence in more oceanic fishes, where extensive gene flow and reduced environmental selection may preclude local adaptation, remains unclear. If oceanic species lack genetic structure, they may be limited in their ability to adapt to global climate change. We examined the potential for adaptation in oceanic fishes by testing whether an oceanic silverside, the California grunion Leuresthes tenuis, displays CnGV in growth capacity and CoGV in vertebral number across a latitudinal gradient as found in estuarine silversides. Common garden experiments revealed that reaction norms for growth in response to temperature differed little among 3 L. tenuis populations from different latitudes. Growth rates of wild adult L. tenuis measured from scale analysis suggested that growth may be slightly faster at more southern latitudes, likely due to environmental variation. Mean vertebral number in wild L. tenuis, determined from radiographs, were nearly identical for all populations. Overall, our results did not provide evidence for spatial adaptations in these traits of L. tenuis, in contrast to the strong patterns of latitudinal trait adaptation in other, more estuarine silversides.

Samples were collected at four Atlantic locations, including Spain, Portugal, France and the South of Ireland, and genetically assayed using a suite of species-specific markers, including 15 putatively neutral microsatellites and 23 expressed sequence tag-linked markers, as well as a portion of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region.

We focused on exon 2 of the Dqa gene because it is highly variable in a large array of species and appears to evolve under pathogen-mediated selection in several rodent species. Using single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and sequencing techniques, 17 Dqa-exon2 alleles, belonging to at least two different copies of Dqa gene, were detected over the distribution range of M.glareolus. Evidence of selection was found using molecular and population analyses. At the molecular level, we detected 13 codons evolving under positive selection pressures, most of them corresponding to regions coding for putative antigen binding sites of the protein. At the European level, we compared patterns of population structure for the Dqa-exon2 and cytochrome b (cyt b) gene. We did not detect any spatial genetic structure among M.glareolus populations for the Dqa-exon2. These results strongly differed from those obtained using the cyt b gene, which indicated a recent phylogeographical history closely linked to the last glacial events. Seven mitochondrial lineages have yet been described, which correspond to major glacial refugia.

"Regional pools and environmental controls of vertebrate richness","10.1086/664610","Belmaker J., Jetz W.","The species richness of local communities depends on the richness of the regional pool and the filtering processes that preclude some regional species from occurring locally. These filters may include absolute attributes of the local environment and also how representative the local environment is of the surrounding region. The latter is consistent with a species-sorting perspective, in which regional species only occupy the local habitats to which they are adapted. Here we evaluate the relative effects of local environmental conditions, environmental representativeness, and environment-independent processes on the probability of local species occurrence, given their regional presence, of birds, mammals, and amphibians worldwide. In multipredictor models, environmental representativeness is a strong independent predictor of local species occurrence probability, with a relative contribution greater than that of absolute local environmental conditions. Furthermore, we find that local occurrence probability diminishes with increased regional richness independent of the local environment. This is consistent with reduced local occupancy in richer regions, which is a pattern that could stem from a largely neutral community assembly process. Our results support the importance of both environmentindependent and species-sorting processes and suggest that regional richness and environmental representativeness should be jointly used for understanding richness gradients across scales. © 2012 by The University of Chicago.",2012,"biological inventories; environmental similarity; range maps; regional enrichment; scale; species pool; species richness; terrestrial vertebrates","Article","SCOPUS"

We predict that fragmentation can reduce dispersal across such barrier-free landscapes because dispersal also is limited by a perception of risk. Considerable fragmentation has occurred in the Riding Mountain National Park (RMNP) region in Manitoba, Canada, during the past 60 years. We examine data from 13 autosomal microsatellites to determine whether fragmentation is correlated with genetic population structure in wolves (Canis lupus). Moderate and significant differentiation between RMNP and a genetic cluster identified 30 km farther north (F ST = 0.053, 95% CI [0.031-0.073]) is consistent with predicted effects of fragmentation. The RMNP population cluster represents at least seven wolf packs followed weekly by radio tracking during 2003-2006. Distinct mtDNA haplotypes have been identified in the Park and no successful wolf dispersal from RMNP has been documented in several multi-year tracking studies since 1974. Tracking data also indicate that some wolves might be reluctant to leave RMNP. Although the influence of behaviour and local adaptation require investigation, human-caused fragmentation appears to have caused cryptic genetic structure on fine spatiotemporal scales in a vagile species that is: (1) not influenced by physical movement barriers or historical ecological discontinuities in our study area, and; (2) able to live relatively close to humans. The Great Plains is now an intensely human-managed landscape. Detection of cryptic genetic structure could therefore function as an important indicator in conservation management. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",2012,"canis lupus; dispersal; fragmentation; gene flow; isolation","Article","SCOPUS"

Species' sensitivity to stress depends on toxicity, life-history, and landscape structure. We developed an individual-based model of an isopod, Asellus aquaticus, to explore how timing of stress events affects population dynamics in a seasonal environment. Furthermore, we tested the relevance of habitat connectivity and spatial distribution of stress for the recovery of a local and total population. The simulation results indicated that population recovery is mainly driven by reproductive periods. Furthermore, high habitat connectivity led to faster recovery both for local and total populations. However, effects of landscape structure disappeared for homogeneously stressed populations, where local survivors increased recovery rate. Finally, local populations recovered faster, implying that assessing recovery in the field needs careful consideration of spatial scale for sampling.

"Latitudinal differences in Mytilus californianus thermal physiology","10.3354/meps09491","Logan C.A., Kost L.E., Somero G.N.","The California ribbed mussel Mytilus californianus (Conrad 1837) is a dominant intertidal species that ranges from Alaska (USA) to Baja California (Mexico) along the west coast of North America. Despite its broad latitudinal range, which results in populations living at widely different temperatures, multiple studies have concluded that this species is genetically homogenous. This may be due to high gene flow, which would inhibit local adaptation, and lack of strong post-settlement selection pressure, which would not favor shifts in allelic frequencies among sites. We investigated several physiological traits that show temperature-adaptive variation in other Mytilus species. We sampled populations of M. californianus at 7 sites across 33° of latitude to test for the possibility of local adaptation or phenotypic plasticity. Individuals acclimated to common conditions were examined for possible differences in whole-organism thermal tolerance. The most northern population (Tatoosh Island) had a significantly lower survival rate following an acute heat stress event than the other populations. Additional physiological processes were examined that affect thermal optima and limits: critical thermal maximum (Hcrit) of cardiac function and metabolic capacity (as indexed by tissue activity of an indicator enzyme, malate dehydrogenase). Tatoosh mussels had a significantly lower Hcrit than other sites, indicating that this population may be adapted to cooler conditions compared to other populations. Metabolic activity did not correlate with latitude of collection. Phenotypic plasticity at the adult stage did not explain differences in thermal tolerance. Thus, genetic differences (local adaptation or balanced polymorphism), developmental plasticity, maternal effects, or within-site thermal heterogeneity may be responsible for the observed variation among populations. © Inter-Research 2012.",2012,"adaptation; environmental variability; latitudinal differences; mytilus; phenotypic plasticity; physiology; stress; temperature","Article","SCOPUS"
"Independence of neutral and adaptive divergence in a low dispersal marine mollusc","10.3354/meps09507","Mariani S., Peijnenburg K.T.C.A., Weetman D.","Identifying how the interplay between neutral and adaptive evolutionary processes shapes the spatial structure of natural populations is a central task in ecology and conservation biology. In marine populations, generally characterised by large population sizes and high gene flow, the simultaneous use of multiple descriptors (i.e. genetic, morphological, life-history, etc.) can be particularly helpful in unravelling the often subtle and complex spatial patterns observed. The gastropod Buccinum undatum (common whelk) lacks a planktonic larval stage, which could promote isolation of local populations and lead to phenotypic divergence through genetic drift or local adaptation. Despite the commercial significance of this species, the relative importance of these 2 forces remains unknown. Here, we used microsatellites, geometric morphometrics and shell thickness measurements to investigate the evolutionary dynamics generating spatial variation in 10 whelk populations in coastal waters around Ireland. Genetic diversity was generally high and genetic structure moderate but significant (overall F ST = 0.019), in accordance with an isolation-by-distance pattern. Phenotypic divergence, as measured by PST, was uncorrelated with, and much more pronounced than, neutral divergence (F ST), indicating that environmental variation rather than population isolation drives phenotypic differentiation. For some traits, at least, diversifying selection is likely to be involved unless additive genetic components of phenotypic variation among populations are very low. Our results document a lack of correspondence between neutral and adaptive divergence, and highlight the need to couple connectivity estimates with the assessment of ecologically relevant traits in fisheries management and conservation. © 2012 Inter-Research.",2012,"adaptation; buccinum undatum; gastropoda; genetic drift; geometric morphometrics; microsatellites; pst","Article","SCOPUS"

This paper critically examines the assumptions, exclusions, and orientations that characterize this broad literature, and suggests revising and expanding the terms upon which it is carried out. It focuses in particular on the exclusion of colonialism from the study of human vulnerability and adaptation to climatic change, the framing of Indigenous peoples and communities in terms of the local and the traditional, and the ways in which efforts to improve the lives of northern Indigenous peoples risk perpetuating colonial relations.

"Rates of evolution in stress-related genes are associated with habitat preference in two Cardamine lineages","10.1186/1471-2148-12-7","Ometto L., Li M., Bresadola L., Varotto C.","Background: Elucidating the selective and neutral forces underlying molecular evolution is fundamental to understanding the genetic basis of adaptation. Plants have evolved a suite of adaptive responses to cope with variable environmental conditions, but relatively little is known about which genes are involved in such responses. Here we studied molecular evolution on a genome-wide scale in two species of Cardamine with distinct habitat preferences: C. resedifolia, found at high altitudes, and C. impatiens, found at low altitudes. Our analyses focussed on genes that are involved in stress responses to two factors that differentiate the high- and low-altitude habitats, namely temperature and irradiation. Results: High-throughput sequencing was used to obtain gene sequences from C. resedifolia and C. impatiens. Using the available A. thaliana gene sequences and annotation, we identified nearly 3,000 triplets of putative orthologues, including genes involved in cold response, photosynthesis or in general stress responses. By comparing estimated rates of molecular substitution, codon usage, and gene expression in these species with those of Arabidopsis, we were able to evaluate the role of positive and relaxed selection in driving the evolution of Cardamine genes. Our analyses revealed a statistically significant higher rate of molecular substitution in C. resedifolia than in C. impatiens, compatible with more efficient positive selection in the former. Conversely, the genome-wide level of selective pressure is compatible with more relaxed selection in C. impatiens. Moreover, levels of selective pressure were heterogeneous between functional classes and between species, with cold responsive genes evolving particularly fast in C. resedifolia, but not in C. impatiens. Conclusions: Overall, our comparative genomic analyses revealed that differences in effective population size might contribute to the differences in the rate of protein evolution and in the levels of selective pressure between the C. impatiens and C. resedifolia lineages. The within-species analyses also revealed evolutionary patterns associated with habitat preference of two Cardamine species. We conclude that the selective pressures associated with the habitats typical of C. resedifolia may have caused the rapid evolution of genes involved in cold response. © 2012 Ometto et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2012,"454 next generation sequencing; adaptive traits; cardamine; habitat preference; molecular evolution","Article","SCOPUS"

"Patterns of species ranges, speciation, and extinction","10.1086/663202","Birand A., Vose A., Gavrilets S.","The exact nature of the relationship among species range sizes, speciation, and extinction events is not well understood. The factors that promote larger ranges, such as broad niche widths and high dispersal abilities, could increase the likelihood of encountering new habitats but also prevent local adaptation due to high gene flow. Similarly, low dispersal abilities or narrower niche widths could cause populations to be isolated, but such populations may lack advantageous mutations due to low population sizes. Here we present a large-scale, spatially explicit, individual-based model addressing the relationships between species ranges, speciation, and extinction. We followed the evolutionary dynamics of hundreds of thousands of diploid individuals for 200,000 generations. Individuals adapted to multiple resources and formed ecological species in a multidimensional trait space. These species varied in niche widths, and we observed the coexistence of generalists and specialists on a few resources. Our model shows that species ranges correlate with dispersal abilities but do not change with the strength of fitness trade-offs; however, high dispersal abilities and low resource utilization costs, which favored broad niche widths, have a strong negative effect on speciation rates. An unexpected result of our model is the strong effect of underlying resource distributions on speciation: in highly fragmented landscapes, speciation rates are reduced. © 2011 by The University of Chicago.",2012,"adaptive radiation; coexistence; fragmentation; lognormal; rare species; trade-off","Article","SCOPUS"

We analyzed samples from the Rio de la Plata estuary obtained in Uruguayan waters and from the Atlantic Ocean obtained in both Uruguayan and Brazilian waters. Mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA markers were used to study differentiation between the estuary and the ocean and the association between kinship and social group structure. Although multilocus analyses suggested that franciscanas are structured into 2 subpopulations (K = 2, divergence among clusters: FST = 0.06, P = 0.002; RST = 0.3, P = 0.001), mitochondrial markers did not support such divergence (FST = 0.02, P = 0.12; ST = 0.06, P =0.06). However, these units are not entirely segregated geographically. Regarding social structure, some groups are composed by first-order related individuals (R ≥ 0.5, P < 0.5). Overall, the data suggest that matrilines could be the social unit in this species. We argue that the divergence found could be associated to local adaptation and social structure, resulting from either feature leading to a recent divergence or reflecting equilibrium between local differentiation and gene flow.

While it is becoming increasingly clear that population diversity can increase stability in species abundance, less is known about how population diversity can benefit consumers that can integrate across population diversity in their prey. Here we demonstrate cascading effects of thermal heterogeneity on trout-salmon interactions in streams where rainbow trout rely heavily on the seasonal availability of anadromous salmon eggs. Water temperature in an Alaskan stream varied spatially from 58C to 17.58C, and spawning sockeye salmon showed population differentiation associated with this thermal heterogeneity. Individuals that spawned early in cool regions of the 5 km long stream were genetically differentiated from those spawning in warmer regions later in the season. Sockeye salmon spawning generates a pulsed resource subsidy that supports the majority of seasonal growth in stream-dwelling rainbow trout. The spatial and temporal structuring of sockeye salmon spawn timing in our focal stream extended the duration of the pulsed subsidy compared to a thermally homogeneous stream with a single population of salmon. Further, rainbow trout adopted movement strategies that exploited the multiple pulses of egg subsidies in the thermally heterogeneous stream. Fish that moved to track the resource pulse grew at rates about 2.5 times higher than those that remained stationary or trout in the reference stream with a single seasonal pulse of eggs. Our results demonstrate that habitat heterogeneity can have important effects on the population diversity of dominant species, and in turn, influence their value to species that prey upon them. Therefore, habitat homogenization may have farther-reaching ecological effects than previously considered. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.",2011,"alaska; behavioral adaptation; biocomplexity; habitat heterogeneity; habitat portfolio; life history variation; pacific salmon; population diversity; rainbow trout; usa; water temperature","Article","SCOPUS"

To investigate nuclear microsatellites population structure in A. cerana, single workers of A. cerana colonies from Thailand were genotyped at 18 microsatellite loci. The loci showed intermediate to high levels of heterozygosity and a range of allele numbers. The analyses confirmed a fundamental subdivision of the Thai A. cerana population into the ""Asia Mainland"" and ""Sundaland"" regions at the Isthmus of Kra. However, the nuclear microsatellite differentiation was less distinct than mtDNA haplotype differences, suggesting male-biased dispersal and population admixture. Overall, samples showed a weak isolation-by-distance effect. The isolated population on Samui island was most differentiated from the other samples. The results do not support our initial hypothesis of local host-pathogen co-evolution, which predicts a strict correspondence between the nuclear genome and the lineage of parasitic Varroa mite of the A. cerana samples, because the gene flow indicated by our nuclear microsatellite markers should also mix potential Varroa resistance alleles among subpopulations. Instead, our study suggests that the coincidental distribution of Varroa lineages and A. cerana population structure in Thailand are the result of biogeographic history and current migration patterns. © 2011 International Union for the Study of Social Insects (IUSSI).",2011,"biogeography; co-evolution; local adaptation; microsatellites; population structure","Article","SCOPUS"

Here, we investigated the combined influences of major environmental features and stocking with non-native fish on the genetic structure and local adaptation of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) populations. We used 17 microsatellite loci to genotype 975 individuals originating from 34 French rivers. Bayesian analyses revealed a hierarchical genetic structure into five geographically distinct clusters. Coastal distance, geological substrate and river length were strong predictors of population structure. Gene flow was higher among rivers with similar geologies, suggesting local adaptation to geological substrate. The effect of river length was mainly owing to one highly differentiated population that has the farthest spawning grounds off the river mouth (up to 900 km) and the largest fish, suggesting local adaptation to river length. We detected high levels of admixture in stocked populations but also in neighbouring ones, implying large-scale impacts of stocking through dispersal of non-native individuals. However, we found relatively few admixed individuals suggesting a lower fitness of stocked fish and/or some reproductive isolation between wild and stocked individuals. When excluding stocked populations, genetic structure increased as did its correlation with environmental factors. This study overall indicates that geological substrate and river length are major environmental factors influencing gene flow and potential local adaptation among Atlantic salmon populations but that stocking with non-native individuals may ultimately disrupt these natural patterns of gene flow among locally adapted populations. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",2011,"atlantic salmon; genetic structure; introgression; landscape genetics; local adaptation; stocking","Article","SCOPUS"

"Population delimitation across contrasting evolutionary clines in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus)","10.1002/ece3.3","Yang D.-S., Kenagy G.","Despite current interest in population genetics, a concrete definition of a ""population"" remains elusive. Multiple ecologically and evolutionarily based definitions of population are in current use, which focus, respectively, on demographic and genetic interactions. Accurate population delimitation is crucial for not only evolutionary and ecological population biology, but also for conservation of threatened populations. Along the Pacific Coast of North America, two contrasting patterns of geographic variation in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) converge within the state of Oregon. Populations of these mice diverge morphologically across an east-west axis, and they diverge in mitochondrial DNA haplotypes across a north-south axis. In this study, we investigate these geographically contrasting patterns of differentiation in the context of ecological and evolutionary definitions (paradigms) of populations. We investigate these patterns using a new and geographically expansive sample that integrates data on morphology, mitochondrial DNA, and nuclear DNA. We found no evidence of nuclear genetic differentiation between the morphologically and mitochondrially distinct populations, thus indicating the occurrence of gene flowacross Oregon. Under the evolutionary paradigm, Oregon populations can be considered a single population, whereasmorphological and mitochondrial differentiations do not indicate distinct populations. In contrast, under the ecological paradigm morphological differentiation indicates distinct populations based on the low likelihood of demographic interactions between geographically distant individuals. The two sympatric but mitochondrially distinct haplogroups form a single population under the ecological paradigm. Hence, we find that the difference between evolutionary and ecological paradigms is the timescale of interest, and we believe that themore chronologically inclusive evolutionary paradigm may be preferable except in cases where only a single generation is of interest. © 2011 The Authors.",2011,"gene flow; genealogical discordance; local adaptation; peromyscus maniculatus; population delimitation","Article","SCOPUS"

In the present study we analyzed 92 gene-associated single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in Atlantic cod Gadus morhua from several sampling sites within the North Sea and adjacent areas. To test for temporal stability, we included long- and short-term (i.e. from 24 to 38 and from 8 to 11 yr, respectively) temporally replicated samples from a subset of populations. As expected, we found very low levels of neutral genetic population structure (FST = 0.003). Three specific loci, however, showed highly elevated levels of genetic differentiation. Interestingly, these loci were identical to loci previously found to display signals of adaptive evolution on larger spatial scales. Analysis of historical samples revealed long-term temporally stable patterns of both neutral and adaptive divergence between some populations, indicating long-term temporal adaptive stability driven by strong local selection. In an environmentally dynamic area, on the other hand, patterns of genetic structuring were more variable.

Discrimination between populations within these three regions also had a high degree of correct classification (89·0-95·8%). Principle component analysis identified largest differences to be in head characters, notably eye diameter and jawbone, with the smallest diameter and head size among the northernmost populations. Fish from the southern rivers had a deeper body form whereas fish from the middle region had larger heads and pectoral fins.

The identification of genomic polymorphisms that account for adaptive variation can aid in finding candidate loci for local adaptation. Consequently, a comparison of spatial patterns in neutral markers and loci under selection may help disentangle the effects of gene flow, genetic drift and selection at the landscape scale. Many amphibians breed in wetlands, which differ in environmental conditions and in the degree of isolation, enhancing the potential for local adaptation. We used microsatellite markers to measure genetic differentiation among 17 local populations of Rana arvalis breeding in a network of wetlands. We found that locus RC08604 deviated from neutral expectations, suggesting that it is a good candidate for directional selection. We used a genetic network analysis to show that the allele distribution in this locus is correlated with habitat characteristics, whereas this was not the case at neutral markers that displayed a different allele distribution and population network in the study area. The graph approach illustrated the genomic heterogeneity (neutral loci vs. the candidate locus for directional selection) of gene exchange and genetic divergence among populations under directional selection. Limited gene flow between wetlands was only observed at the candidate genomic region under directional selection. RC08604 is partially located inside an up-regulated thyroid-hormone receptor (TRβ) gene coordinating the expression of other genes during metamorphosis and appears to be linked with variation in larval life-history traits found among R. arvalis populations. We suggest that directional selection on genes coding larval life-history traits is strong enough to maintain the divergence in these genomic regions, reducing the effective recombination of locally adapted alleles but not in other regions of the genome. Integrating this knowledge into conservation plans at the landscape scale will improve the design of management strategies to preserve adaptive genetic diversity in wetland networks. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",2011,"conservation units; directional selection; habitat heterogeneity; local adaptation; population structure; stabilizing selection","Article","SCOPUS"

However, gene flow may also lead to the evolution of phenotypic plasticity. We investigated the effect of gene flow on local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity in development time in island populations of the common frog Rana temporaria which breed in pools that differ in drying regimes. This was done by investigating associations between traits (measured in a common garden experiment) and selective factors (pool drying regimes and gene flow from other populations inhabiting different environments) by regression analyses and by comparing pairwise FST values (obtained from microsatellite analyses) with pairwise QST values. We found that the degree of phenotypic plasticity was positively correlated with gene flow from other populations inhabiting different environments (among-island environmental heterogeneity), as well as with local environmental heterogeneity within each population. Furthermore, local adaptation, manifested in the correlation between development time and the degree of pool drying on the islands, appears to have been caused by divergent selection pressures. The local adaptation in development time and phenotypic plasticity is quite remarkable, because the populations are young (less than 300 generations) and substantial gene flow is present among islands. © 2010 The Author(s).

Yet, little is known about the geographical scale of local adaptation. Is adaptive divergence primarily evident at the scale of regions or individual populations? Also, many salmonid populations are subject to spawning intrusion by farmed conspecifics that experience selection regimes fundamentally different from wild populations. This prompts the question if adaptive differences between wild populations and hatchery strains are more pronounced than between different wild populations? We addressed these issues by analyzing variation at 74 microsatellite loci (including anonymous and expressed sequence tag- and quantitative trait locus-linked markers) in 15 anadromous wild brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) populations, representing five geographical regions, along with two lake populations and two hatchery strains used for stocking some of the populations. FST-based outlier tests revealed more outlier loci between different geographical regions separated by 522±228 km (mean±s.d.) than between populations within regions separated by 117±79 km (mean±s.d.). A significant association between geographical distance and number of outliers between regions was evident. There was no evidence for more outliers in comparisons involving hatchery trout, but the loci under putative selection generally were not the same as those found to be outliers between wild populations. Our study supports the notion of local adaption being increasingly important at the scale of regions as compared with individual populations, and suggests that loci involved in adaptation to captive environments are not necessarily the same as those involved in adaptive divergence among wild populations. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",2011,"adaptive divergence; genome scan; landscape genomics; salmonid fishes; selection; stocking","Article","SCOPUS"
"Temporal change in genetic integrity suggests loss of local adaptation in a wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) population following introgression by farmed escapees","10.1038/hdy.2010.165","Bourret V., O'Reilly P.T., Carr J.W., Berg P.R., Bernatchez L.","In some wild Atlantic salmon populations, rapid declines in numbers of wild returning adults has been associated with an increase in the prevalence of farmed salmon. Studies of phenotypic variation have shown that interbreeding between farmed and wild salmon may lead to loss of local adaptation. Yet, few studies have attempted to assess the impact of interbreeding at the genome level, especially among North American populations. Here, we document temporal changes in the genetic makeup of the severely threatened Magaguadavic River salmon population (Bay of Fundy, Canada), a population that might have been impacted by interbreeding with farmed salmon for nearly 20 years. Wild and farmed individuals caught entering the river from 1980 to 2005 were genotyped at 112 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and/or eight microsatellite loci, to scan for potential shifts in adaptive genetic variation. No significant temporal change in microsatellite-based estimates of allele richness or gene diversity was detected in the wild population, despite its precipitous decline in numbers over the last two decades. This might reflect the effect of introgression from farmed salmon, which was corroborated by temporal change in linkage-disequilibrium. Moreover, SNP genome scans identified a temporal decrease in candidate loci potentially under directional selection. Of particular interest was a SNP previously shown to be strongly associated with an important quantitative trait locus for parr mark number, which retained its genetic distinctiveness between farmed and wild fish longer than other outliers. Overall, these results indicate that farmed escapees have introgressed with wild Magaguadavic salmon resulting in significant alteration of the genetic integrity of the native population, including possible loss of adaptation to wild conditions. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",2011,"conservation; farm escapees; genome scan; introgression; local adaptation; snp","Article","SCOPUS"
"The future of baltic sea populations: Local extinction or evolutionary rescue?","10.1007/s13280-010-0129-x","Johannesson K., Smolarz K., Grahn M., André C.","Environmental change challenges local and global survival of populations and species. In a speciespoor environment like the Baltic Sea this is particularly critical as major ecosystem functions may be upheld by single species. A complex interplay between demographic and genetic characteristics of species and populations determines risks of local extinction, chances of re-establishment of lost populations, and tolerance to environmental changes by evolution of new adaptations. Recent studies show that Baltic populations of dominant marine species are locally adapted, have lost genetic variation and are relatively isolated. In addition, some have evolved unusually high degrees of clonality and others are representatives of endemic (unique) evolutionary lineages. We here suggest that a consequence of local adaptation, isolation and genetic endemism is an increased risk of failure in restoring extinct Baltic populations. Additionally, restricted availability of genetic variation owing to lost variation and isolation may negatively impact the potential for evolutionary rescue following environmental change. © Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2011.",2011,"biocomplexity; endemic lineages evolution of tolerance to contamination; genetic variation; marginal environment","Article","SCOPUS"

Less than 1200 individuals remain, and the species is declining at a rate of approximately 4% per year as a result of juvenile starvation, shark predation, and entanglement in marine debris. Some of these problems may be alleviated by translocation; however, if island breeding aggregates are effectively isolated subpopulations, moving individuals may disrupt local adaptations. In these circumstances, managers must balance the pragmatic need of increasing survival with theoretical concerns about genetic viability. To assess range-wide population structure of the Hawaiian monk seal, we examined an unprecedented, near-complete genetic inventory of the species (n =1897 seals, sampled over 14 years) at 18 microsatellite loci. Genetic variation was not spatially partitioned (w=-0.03, p = 1.0), and a Bayesian clustering method provided evidence of one panmictic population (K =1). Pairwise FSTcomparisons (among 7 island aggregates over 14 annual cohorts) did not reveal temporally stable, spatial reproductive isolation. Our results coupled with long-term tag-resight data confirm seal movement and gene flow throughout the Hawaiian Archipelago.

Metabolic theory of ecology and experimental studies at the cross-species level suggest the existence of general patterns linking natural mortality to body mass and temperature. However, there is scant evidence that similar relationships also hold at the intra-specific scale, possibly because of the relatively narrow range of sizes and temperatures experienced by most species and the effect of local adaptation, which can obscure links between temperature and vital rates. In this sense, the European eel Anguilla anguilla, a panmictic species with a wide distribution range, provides a paradigmatic case. We compiled data published in the past 30 years on eel mortality during the continental phase of the life cycle for 15 eel stocks and calibrated a general model for mortality, considering the effects of body mass, temperature, stock density and gender. Estimated activation energy (E = 1.2 eV) was at the upper extreme reported for metabolic reactions. Estimated mortality rates (ranging between 0.02 year-1 at 8°C, low density and 0.47 year-1 at 18°C, high density for a body mass of 100 g) were appreciably lower than those of most fishes, most likely due to the exceptionally low energy-consuming metabolism of eel. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",2011,"allometric theory; anguilla anguilla; density-dependent survival; life history variation; temperature scaling of vital rates","Article","SCOPUS"

Effective defences against native biological threats in indigenous species, whether structural or inducible, often seem inoperative against invasive species. Here, we show that tadpoles of the Iberian green frog detect chemical cues from indigenous predators (dragonfly nymphs) and respond by reducing their activity and developing an efficient defensive morphology against them (increased tail depth and pigmentation). Those defensive responses, however, were not activated against a highly damaging invasive predator (red swamp crayfish). Induced defences increased tadpole survival when faced against either indigenous dragonflies or invasive crayfish, so its inactivation in the presence of the invasive predator seems to be due to failure in cue recognition. Furthermore, we tested for local adaptation to the invasive predator by comparing individuals from ponds either exposed to or free from crayfish. In both cases, tadpoles failed to express inducible defences against crayfish, indicating that ca 30 years of contact with the invasive species (roughly 10-15 frog generations) have been insufficient for the evolution of recognition of invasive predator cues. © 2011 The Royal Society.",2011,"anti-predator defences; biological invasions; cue recognition; dragonflies; phenotypic plasticity; red swamp crayfish","Article","SCOPUS"

Specifically, we use adaptive ecological divergence (here, population divergence in host plant use and preference) as a proxy for selection strength and evaluate the correlation between levels of adaptive and genetic differentiation across pairwise population comparisons. Positive correlations would reveal the pattern predicted by our hypothesis, that of ‘isolation by adaptation’ (IBA). Notably, IBA is predicted not only for selected loci but also for neutral loci. This may reflect the effects of divergent selection on neutral loci that are ‘loosely linked’ to divergently selected loci or on geneflow restriction that facilitates genetic drift at all loci, including neutral loci that are completely unlinked to those evolving under divergent selection. Here, we evaluate IBA in maple-and willow-associated populations of Neochlamisus bebbianae leaf beetles. To do so, we collected host preference data to construct adaptive divergence indices and used AFLPs (amplified fragment length polymorphisms) and mitochondrial sequences to quantify genetic differentiation. Partial Mantel tests showed significant IBA in ‘pooled’ analyses of putatively neutral and of putatively selected (‘outlier’) AFLP loci. This pattern was also recovered in 12% of ‘locus-specific’ analyses that separately evaluated genetic differentiation at individual neutral loci. These results provided evidence for widespread effects of selection on neutral genomic divergence.

We show that widespread hybridization has occurred between two neo-tropical stream fishes with partial reproductive isolation. Phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial sequence data showed that the swordtail fish Xiphophorus birchmanni is monophyletic and that X. malinche is part of an independent monophyletic clade with other species. Using informative single nucleotide polymorphisms in one mitochondrial and three nuclear intron loci, we genotyped 776 specimens collected from twenty-three sites along seven separate stream reaches. Hybrid zones occurred in replicated fashion in all stream reaches along a gradient from high to low elevation. Genotyping revealed substantial variation in parental and hybrid frequencies among localities. Tests of F IS and linkage disequilibrium (LD) revealed generally low F IS and LD except in five populations where both parental species and hybrids were found suggesting incomplete reproductive isolation. In these locations, heterozygote deficiency and LD were high, which suggests either selection against early generation hybrids or assortative mating. These data lay the foundation to study the adaptive basis of the replicated hybrid zone structure and for future integration of behaviour and genetics to determine the processes that lead to the population genetic patterns observed in these hybrid zones. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",2011,"elevational gradient; introgression; linkage disequilibrium; local adaptation; poeciliidae; population genetics","Article","SCOPUS"

Roach (Rutilus rutilus), a freshwater fish, engage in partial migration where parts of populations switch between summer habitats in lakes and winter habitats in connected streams. To test if the partial migration trait is phenotypically plastic or has genetic components, we translocated roach from 2 populations with different opportunities for migration to a lake with migration opportunity, containing a local roach population. This enabled monitoring of partial migration of fish in 3 different situations: 1) previous opportunity for migration, migrating in a familiar environment (the local population); 2) previous opportunity for migration, migrating in an unfamiliar environment; and 3) no previous opportunity for seasonal migration, migrating in an unfamiliar environment. In addition, we evaluated the migration patterns of roach in the lake with migration opportunity wherefrom group 2 fish were translocated. Directional migration in and out of the lakes was monitored using Passive Integrated Transponder technology. Translocated fish with previous migration opportunity showed migration patterns more similar to local fish than to their home lake population, and individuals translocated from the lake without migration opportunity migrated when given the opportunity, suggesting that partial migration is phenotypically plastic and triggered by lake-specific environmental cues. We found temperature to be a proximate cue for migration decisions. Individuals without previous migration opportunity migrated at a lower proportion and with different small-scale migration patterns, suggesting that also genetic components are involved in the expression of the partial migration trait. © The Author 2010.

Here, populations of the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus are examined at both local and latitudinal scales to determine whether these populations have evolved differences in their survival under high temperature stress. A clear pattern of increasing high temperature stress tolerance is seen with decreasing latitude, consistent with temperature adaptation. Additionally, there is also evidence for significant variation in thermal tolerance on a smaller scale. The competitive fitness of pairs of northern and southern copepod populations were also examined under a series of lower, more moderate temperatures. These fitness assays show that the southern populations that have the best survival under extreme high temperatures have lowered competitive fitness at the lower temperatures tested, whereas the fitness of the southern populations exceeded that of the northern populations at the highest temperatures tested. Combined, these results suggest that there may be evolutionary trade-offs between performance at high and stressful temperatures and fitness at moderate temperatures in this species. © 2010 The Author(s).

Genetic isolation by distance patterns hold clues to dispersal, but understanding these patterns quantitatively has been complicated by uncertainty in effective density. In this study, we genotyped populations of a coral reef fish (Amphiprion clarkii) at 13 microsatellite loci to uncover fine-scale isolation by distance patterns in two replicate transects. Temporal changes in allele frequencies between generations suggested that effective densities in these populations are 4-21 adults/km. A separate estimate from census densities suggested that effective densities may be as high as 82-178 adults/km. Applying these effective densities with isolation by distance theory suggested that larval dispersal kernels in A. clarkii had a spread near 11 km (4-27 km). These kernels predicted low fractions of self-recruitment in continuous habitats, but the same kernels were consistent with previously reported, high self-recruitment fractions (40-60%) when realistic levels of habitat patchiness were considered. Our results suggested that ecologically relevant larval dispersal can be estimated with widely available genetic methods when effective density is measured carefully through cohort sampling and ecological censuses, and that self-recruitment studies should be interpreted in light of habitat patchiness. © 2010 The Author(s).

The high genetic structure detected in H. armiger could be a consequence of poor dispersal ability, local adaptation, or marked female philopatry. The lack of genetic structure among 3 regions separated by the Gaoligong Range and the Qiongzhou Strait could be due to incomplete lineage sorting.

This designation is decades old and warrants re-evaluation in light of concerns that fisheries management units may not reflect biologically meaningful population units. In this study, we used 10 microsatellite loci, the PanI locus, and 5 single nucleotide polymorphism markers to characterize the population genetic structure of cod in US waters. We found significant differentiation among temporally and spatially divergent populations of cod (global FST = 0.0044), primarily stemming from 2 potentially non-neutral loci, and evidence for a population structure that strongly contradicts the current 2-stock management model. This genetic structure was stable over a 5 yr period. Our results indicate that cod in US waters are broadly structured into 3 groups: (1) a northern spring-spawning coastal complex in the Gulf of Maine (GOM), (2) a southern complex consisting of winter-spawning inshore GOM, offshore GOM and sites south of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and (3) a Georges Bank population. The strongest differentiation occurs between populations in the northern and southern complex (mean FST = 0.0085), some of which spawn in the same bays in different seasons. By means of mixture analysis, young-of-the-year fish sampled on juvenile nurseries were assigned to the spawning complex of their origin. Our findings contribute to a growing body of knowledge that Atlantic cod and other marine fish populations are structured on a finer scale than previously thought and that this structure supports biocomplexity and locally adapted populations. As such, it may be warranted to re-evaluate current management units and tailor management plans toward this finer scale.

However, body size and body condition of individuals can vary significantly at the intraspecific level between geographic locations, which is usually explained by phenotypic plasticity or local adaptation. We suggest that a higher body condition per se might not be a good indicator of physiological health status, particularly when comparing populations inhabiting places with different levels of habitat alteration. We examined two populations of the western pond turtle Emys marmorata in the northern part of California's Central Valley, and found that individuals inhabiting a water pollution control plant located on the valley floor had significantly larger body size and higher body condition than those inhabiting an unaltered natural habitat in the foothills. However, turtles from the water pollution control plant did not show a better health status, estimated by comparisons between two immune system variables: T-cell-mediated immune response and heterophil/lymphocyte ratio. Parameters such as body size and body condition might be misleading indicators of health condition, particularly when they are used to estimate health status of populations from habitats with different levels of alteration.

Assessment of local adaptation generally requires logistically challenging experiments. Here, using a unique approach and a large dataset (>50,000 observations from across Britain), we compare the covariation in temperature and first spawning dates of the common frog (Rana temporaria) across space with that across time. We show that although all populations exhibit a plastic response to temperature, spawning earlier in warmer years, between-population differences in first spawning dates are dominated by local adaptation. Given climate change projections for Britain in 2050-2070, we project that for populations to remain as locally adapted as contemporary populations will require first spawning date to advance by ∼21-39 days but that plasticity alone will only enable an advance of ∼5-9 days. Populations may thus face a microevolutionary and gene flow challenge to advance first spawning date by a further ∼16-30 days over the next 50 years.",2010,"climate change; ecogeographic; phenology; plasticity; quantitative genetics","Article","SCOPUS"

Consequently, patterns of MHC genetic variation should reflect selection pressures across the landscape. We examined genetic variation and population genetic structure at the MHC class I-A1 and class II-B1 exons in five Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) populations from two geographic regions in British Columbia, Canada. We then compared estimates of population structure at the MHC genes with neutral estimates based on microsatellites to examine the potential for local adaptation at the MHC. Chinook salmon are in decline throughout much of their native range and understanding the degree of local adaptation exhibited by the MHC may be important in conservation planning. Comparisons among populations yielded higher G′ ST estimates for the MHC class I than expected under neutrality based on the microsatellites. In contrast, the MHC class II tended to exhibit lower G′ ST values than did the microsatellites. These results suggest that across populations unique selection pressures are driving allele frequency differences at the MHC class I but that the MHC class II may be the subject of homogenizing selection. Rates of nonsynonymous versus synonymous substitutions found in codons associated within the MHC class I and II peptide-binding regions provided strong evidence of positive selection.

In this study, we combined estimates of microsatellite and transcriptomic variation to assess the population structure and potential for adaptive variation of threatened Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, among rivers in the Bay of Fundy. In general, population structure identified by genetic differentiation was consistent with the patterns of variation in gene expression, although there was not a strong correlation between neutral genetic variation and variation in gene expression. Both data sets provided clear indication of strong regional differentiation between rivers located within the inner Bay of Fundy relative to rivers located within the outer Bay of Fundy or the Southern Upland region, and there was also support for more refined population structure. Both data sets indicated that Atlantic salmon populations from the inner and outer Bay of Fundy reflect unique genetic lineages, with some evidence of population differentiation between regions of the inner Bay of Fundy, and between individual rivers within a region. Consistency of the microarray data across 2 years helped to validate the use of this technique as a useful tool in assessment of variation among wild populations for species conservation. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",2010,"bay of fundy; conservation; gene expression; genomics; neutral genetic variation; salmon","Article","SCOPUS"
"Recent local adaptation of sockeye salmon to glacial spawning habitats","10.1007/s10682-009-9313-5","Ramstad K.M., Woody C.A., Allendorf F.W.","Salmonids spawn in highly diverse habitats, exhibit strong genetic population structuring, and can quickly colonize newly created habitats with few founders. Spawning traits often differ among populations, but it is largely unknown if these differences are adaptive or due to genetic drift. To test if sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) populations are adapted to glacial, beach, and tributary spawning habitats, we examined variation in heritable phenotypic traits associated with spawning in 13 populations of wild sockeye salmon in Lake Clark, Alaska. These populations were commonly founded between 100 and 400 hundred sockeye salmon generations ago and exhibit low genetic divergence at 11 microsatellite loci (FST &lt; 0.024) that is uncorrelated with spawning habitat type. We found that mean PST (phenotypic divergence among populations) exceeded neutral FST for most phenotypic traits measured, indicating that phenotypic differences among populations could not be explained by genetic drift alone. Phenotypic divergence among populations was associated with spawning habitat differences, but not with neutral genetic divergence. For example, female body color was lighter and egg color was darker in glacial than non-glacial habitats. This may be due to reduced sexual selection for red spawning color in glacial habitats and an apparent trade-off in carotenoid allocation to body and egg color in females. Phenotypic plasticity is an unlikely source of phenotypic differences because Lake Clark sockeye salmon spend nearly all their lives in a common environment. Our data suggest that Lake Clark sockeye salmon populations are adapted to spawning in glacial, beach and tributary habitats and provide the first evidence of a glacial spawning ecotype in salmonids. Glacial spawning habitats are often young (i. e., &lt;200 years old) and ephemeral. Thus, local adaptation of sockeye salmon to glacial habitats appears to have occurred recently. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",2010,"bottleneck; carotenoid; glacial; local adaptation; oncorhynchus","Article","SCOPUS"
"Population genomics and speciation","10.1007/s10709-008-9321-3","Butlin R.K.","The process of speciation begins with genomically-localised barriers to gene exchange associated with loci for local adaptation, intrinsic incompatibility or assortative mating. The barrier then spreads until reproductive isolation influences the whole genome. The population genomics approach can be used to identify regions of reduced gene flow by detecting loci with greater differentiation than expected from the average across many loci. Recently, this approach has been used in several systems. I review these studies, concentrating on the robustness of the approach and the methods available to go beyond the simple identification of differentiated markers. Population genomics has already contributed significantly to understanding the balance between gene flow and selection during the evolution of reproductive isolation and has great future potential both in genome species and in non-model organisms. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.",2010,"fst; genome scan; local adaptation; reproductive isolation","Article","SCOPUS"

This theory assumes that significant evolutionary change occurs over ecologically relevant timescales and that phenotypes have differential effects on the environment. Here we test the hypothesis that local adaptation causes ecosystem structure and function to diverge.We demonstrate that populations of Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata), characterized by differences in phenotypic and population-level traits, differ in their impact on ecosystem properties. We report results froma replicated, common gardenmesocosm experiment and show that differences between guppy phenotypes result in the divergence of ecosystem structure (algal, invertebrate, and detrital standing stocks) and function (gross primary productivity, leaf decomposition rates, and nutrient flux). These phenotypic effects are further modified by effects of guppy density. We evaluated the generality of these effects by replicating the experiment using guppies derived fromtwoindependent origins of the phenotype. Finally, we tested the ability of multiple guppy traits to explain observed differences in themesocosms.Our findings demonstrate that evolution can significantly affect both ecosystem structure and function. The ecosystem differences reported here are consistent with patterns observed across natural streams and argue that guppies play a significant role in shaping these ecosystems.",2010,"ecological-evolutionary feedbacks; ecosystem function; intraspecific variation","Article","SCOPUS"

Cod from the Clyde demonstrated significantly higher growth rates than cod from St Andrews. In both populations the growth rate was greater at 12°C than at 8°C. These population and temperature effects act to reinforce one another and it could therefore be predicted that the growth differences between the two areas in the wild should be even more pronounced.

However, geographic variation itself is not a proof for local adaptation, as genetic drift and gene flow may also shape patterns of quantitative variation. We studied local and regional variation in means and phenotypic plasticity of larval life history traits in the common frog Rana temporaria using six populations from central Sweden, breeding in either open-canopy or partially closed-canopy ponds. To separate local adaptation from genetic drift, we compared differentiation in quantitative genetic traits (QST) obtained from a common garden experiment with differentiation in presumably neutral microsatellite markers (FST). We found that R. temporaria populations differ in means and plasticities of life history traits in different temperatures at local, and in FST at regional scale. Comparisons of differentiation in quantitative traits and in molecular markers suggested that natural selection was responsible for the divergence in growth and development rates as well as in temperature-induced plasticity, indicating local adaptation. However, at low temperature, the role of genetic drift could not be separated from selection. Phenotypes were correlated with forest canopy closure, but not with geographical or genetic distance. These results indicate that local adaptation can evolve in the presence of ongoing gene flow among the populations, and that natural selection is strong in this system. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",2010,"countergradient variation; gene flow; genetic drift; local adaptation; phenotypic plasticity","Article","SCOPUS"
"Genetic costs of tolerance to metals in daphnia longispina populations historically exposed to a copper mine drainage","10.1002/etc.97","Agra A.R., Guilhermino L., Soares A.M.V.M., Barata C.","The present study was conducted to assess three microevolutionary aspects of adaptation to pollution in Daphnia longispina populations historically exposed to an acid mine drainage from an abandoned pyrite mine: pollution mediated effects in acute tolerance to copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn); pollution-mediated effects on genetic variability of tolerant and physiological traits related to fitness (feeding rates); and fitness costs of tolerance measured as genetic trade-offs between tolerance and feeding rates under none and low levels of contamination. These objectives were addressed by comparing broad sense heritabilities and genetic correlations using up to 20 distinct clonal lineages randomly obtained from two populations: one located in a water reservoir contaminated by the acid mine drainage, and the other located in a nearby clean water reservoir. Results showed that only sensitive and resistant lineages to Cu were present in the reference and contaminated site, respectively. For Zn, however, both populations had a similar distribution pattern of sensitivities. Heritability values for tolerant and feeding traits across metal exposure levels was similar in both populations being in most cases greater than 50%. Fitness costs of tolerance were illustrated by lower feeding rates of the tolerant population compared to the reference one and negative genetic correlations between mean clonal feeding rates and median clonal survival time in control conditions (no added Cu or Zn). The results obtained thus support the view that tolerance to pollution is ecologically costly. © 2009 SETAC.",2010,"adaptation; daphnia longispina; fitness costs; metals; tolerance","Article","SCOPUS"
"Sensitivity of Daphnia species to phosphorus-deficient diets","10.1007/s00442-009-1452-4","Seidendorf B., Meier N., Petrusek A., Boersma M., Streit B., Schwenk K.","The life history of freshwater cladocerans such as Daphnia spp. is strongly affected by their environment. Factors such as temperature, food quantity and even the presence or absence of predators influence growth, reproduction and morphology of individuals. Recently, it has also become clear that the quality of the food can affect various life history traits of Daphnia. More specifically, the effect of the elemental composition of algae, expressed as the C:P ratio, has been studied intensively. Daphnia species differ in their response to differences in the C:P ratio of their food. Until now, it has been unclear whether these species differences are driven by phylogenetic constraints or by adaptation to particular environmental conditions. Here we present laboratory experiments with 12 Daphnia species from three different subgenera originating from a broad range of habitats. We compared somatic growth rates and sensitivity to variation in the nutrient stoichiometry of the food with habitat parameters, taking into account the phylogenetic history of the species. No associations between fitness and habitat parameters were detected. However, we found a trade-off between sensitivity to P-deficient diets and the maximum growth rate on a P-sufficient diet. In several cases, this trade-off helps to explain the association between species distribution and habitat parameters. We observed no correlation of the sensitivity to P limitation with the phylogenetic history of the genus Daphnia. Thus, we conclude that the differential responses among Daphnia species to variation in P content in food were driven mainly by adaptations to their local habitats, and are not constrained by deep evolutionary patterns. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",2010,"cladocera; food quality; life history; phylogeny","Article","SCOPUS"
"Spatial patterns of genetic differentiation in Brachionus calyciflorus species complex collected from East China in summer","10.1007/s10750-009-0010-8","Xiang X.-L., Xi Y.-L., Wen X.-L., Zhang J.-Y., Ma Q.","In this study, the mtDNA COI genes of 124 individuals in Brachionus calyciflorus complex were sequenced and analyzed. Overall, 84 mtDNA haplotypes were defined, and were split into three clades by the phylogenetic trees. The divergences of COI gene sequence among the three clades ranged from 11.4 to 22.5%, indicating the occurrence of three cryptic species (cryptic species 1, cryptic species 2, and cryptic species 3). Within cryptic species 3, a remarkable degree of differentiation (Fst = 0.0947) might be attributable to habitat fragmentation, restricted gene flow, and founder effect, most probably together with local adaptation. The more shared haplotypes were observed, and a non-significant correlation existed between geographic and genetic distance, suggesting that some ancestral haplotypes might be involved in a past range expansion, and as founders give a similar distribution pattern among geographic populations. The networks were also in agreement with the pattern of genetic differentiation in B. calyciflorus species complex revealed by molecular phylogeny. The nested clade analysis suggested a slight geographic structure in the network I, network II, and the highest nesting clade levels within the network III. Under the possible effect of the Younger Dryas Event, the three cryptic species might have survived in multiple relict refugia throughout the south of China. The co-occurrence of cryptic species 2 and 3 might be found in Guangzhou and Hainan due to the possible interference of the barrier and contiguous range expansion. After the Younger Dryas Event, cryptic species 3 with high colonization ability might have arrived and colonized whole habitats at first, and reduce effective gene flow among cryptic species, thus effectively increasing persistence of founder events. Cryptic species 2 might, respectively, have expanded their ranges into Wuhu and Nanjing regions only because of the probable barrier of the Yangtze River, its weak colonization abilities and the 'priority effects' of cryptic species 3. Cryptic species 1 distributed exclusively in Danzhou probably failed to expand its ranges into mainland China because of small population size, weaker dispersal capacity, and the barrier of the Qiongzhou Strait. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.",2010,"brachionus calyciflorus; genetic differentiation; nested clade analysis; phylogeography; spatial pattern; species complex","Article","SCOPUS"
"Parallel adaptive evolution of Atlantic cod on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean in response to temperature","10.1098/rspb.2010.0985","Bradbury, Ian R.","Despite the enormous economic and ecological importance of marine organisms, the spatial scales of adaptation and biocomplexity remain largely unknown. Yet, the preservation of local stocks that possess adaptive diversity is critical to the long-term maintenance of productive stable fisheries and ecosystems. Here, we document genomic evidence of range-wide adaptive differentiation in a broadcast spawning marine fish, Atlantic cod ( Gadus morhua ), using a genome survey of single nucleotide polymorphisms. Of 1641 gene-associated polymorphisms examined, 70 (4.2%) tested positive for signatures of selection using a Bayesian approach. We identify a subset of these loci ( n = 40) for which allele frequencies show parallel temperature-associated clines ( p < 0.001, r 2 = 0.89) in the eastern and western north Atlantic. Temperature associations were robust to the statistical removal of geographic distance or latitude effects, and contrasted ‘neutral’ loci, which displayed no temperature association. Allele frequencies at temperature-associated loci were significantly correlated, spanned three linkage groups and several were successfully annotated supporting the involvement of multiple independent genes. Our results are consistent with the evolution and/or selective sweep of multiple genes in response to ocean temperature, and support the possibility of a new conservation paradigm for non-model marine organisms based on genomic approaches to resolving functional and adaptive diversity.",2010,"atlantic ocean; atlantic cod; local adaptation; natural selection; single nucleotide polymorphysm; temperature","Article","Other"
"RAD sequencing reveals genomewide divergence between independent invasions of the European green crab ( Carcinus maenas ) in the Northwest Atlantic","10.1002/ece3.2872","Jeffery, Nicholas W.","Genomic studies of invasive species can reveal both invasive pathways and functional differences underpinning patterns of colonization success. The European green crab (Carcinus maenas) was initially introduced to eastern North America nearly 200 years ago where it expanded northwards to eastern Nova Scotia. A subsequent invasion to Nova Scotia from a northern European source allowed further range expansion, providing a unique opportunity to study the invasion genomics of a species with multiple invasions. Here, we use restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing-derived SNPs to explore fine-scale genomewide differentiation between these two invasions. We identified 9137 loci from green crab sampled from 11 locations along eastern North America and compared spatial variation to mitochondrial COI sequence variation used previously to characterize these invasions. Overall spatial divergence among invasions was high (pairwise FST ~0.001 to 0.15) and spread across many loci, with a mean FST ~0.052 and 52% of loci examined characterized by FST values >0.05. The majority of the most divergent loci (i.e., outliers, ~1.2%) displayed latitudinal clines in allele frequency highlighting extensive genomic divergence among the invasions. Discriminant analysis of principal components (both neutral and outlier loci) clearly resolved the two invasions spatially and was highly correlated with mitochondrial divergence. Our results reveal extensive cryptic intraspecific genomic diversity associated with differing patterns of colonization success and demonstrates clear utility for genomic approaches to delineating the distribution and colonization success of aquatic invasive species.",2017,"coi; carcinus maenas; european green crab; population structure; restriction-site-associated dna sequencing","Article","Other"

This information gap creates uncertainty in the sustainable management, recovery, and associated resilience of marine communities and our capacity to extrapolate beyond the few species for which such information exists. We document a previously unidentified multispecies biogeographic break aligned with a steep climatic gradient and driven by seasonal temperature minima in the northwest Atlantic. The coherence of this genetic break across our five study species with contrasting life histories suggests a pervasive macroecological phenomenon. The integration of this genetic structure with habitat suitability models and climate forecasts predicts significant variation in northward distributional shifts among populations and availability of suitable habitat in future oceans. The results of our integrated approach provide new perspective on how cryptic intraspecific diversity associated with climatic variation influences species and community response to climate change beyond simple poleward shifts.",2018,"climate change; atlantic ocean; temperatura; climatic gradient; spatial genetic structure; genetic structure","Article","Other"

Several of these loci, such as thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor ( TSHR ), have a well-established role in reproductive biology, whereas others have never been implicated in controlling reproduction.
