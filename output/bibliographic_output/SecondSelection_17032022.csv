"Multi-model seascape genomics identifies distinct environmental drivers of selection among sympatric marine species","10.1186/s12862-020-01679-4","Nielsen, ES; Henriques, R; Beger, M; Toonen, RJ; von der Heyden, S","Background As global change and anthropogenic pressures continue to increase, conservation and management increasingly needs to consider species' potential to adapt to novel environmental conditions. Therefore, it is imperative to characterise the main selective forces acting on ecosystems, and how these may influence the evolutionary potential of populations and species. Using a multi-model seascape genomics approach, we compare putative environmental drivers of selection in three sympatric southern African marine invertebrates with contrasting ecology and life histories: Cape urchin (Parechinus angulosus), Common shore crab (Cyclograpsus punctatus), and Granular limpet (Scutellastra granularis). Results Using pooled (Pool-seq), restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq), and seven outlier detection methods, we characterise genomic variation between populations along a strong biogeographical gradient. Of the three species, onlyS. granularisshowed significant isolation-by-distance, and isolation-by-environment driven by sea surface temperatures (SST). In contrast, sea surface salinity (SSS) and range in air temperature correlated more strongly with genomic variation inC. punctatusandP. angulosus. Differences were also found in genomic structuring between the three species, with outlier loci contributing to two clusters in the East and West Coasts forS. granularisandP. angulosus, but not forC. punctatus. Conclusion The findings illustrate distinct evolutionary potential across species, suggesting that species-specific habitat requirements and responses to environmental stresses may be better predictors of evolutionary patterns than the strong environmental gradients within the region. We also found large discrepancies between outlier detection methodologies, and thus offer a novel multi-model approach to identifying the principal environmental selection forces acting on species. Overall, this work highlights how adding a comparative approach to seascape genomics (both with multiple models and species) can elucidate the intricate evolutionary responses of ecosystems to global change.",2020,"pool-seq; rad-seq; seascape genomics; environmental association; comparative phylogeography; marine invertebrates","Article","ISI","no","NA","NA"
"Seascape genomics of eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) along the Atlantic coast of Canada","10.1111/eva.12741","Bernatchez, S; Xuereb, A; Laporte, M; Benestan, L; Steeves, R; Laflamme, M; Bernatchez, L; Mallet, MA","Interactions between environmental factors and complex life-history characteristics of marine organisms produce the genetic diversity and structure observed within species. Our main goal was to test for genetic differentiation among eastern oyster populations from the coastal region of Canadian Maritimes against expected genetic homogeneity caused by historical events, taking into account spatial and environmental (temperature, salinity, turbidity) variation. This was achieved by genotyping 486 individuals originating from 13 locations using RADSeq. A total of 11,321 filtered SNPs were used in a combination of population genomics and environmental association analyses. We revealed significant neutral genetic differentiation (mean F-ST = 0.009) between sampling locations, and the occurrence of six major genetic clusters within the studied system. Redundancy analyses (RDAs) revealed that spatial and environmental variables explained 3.1% and 4.9% of the neutral genetic variation and 38.6% and 12.2% of the putatively adaptive genetic variation, respectively. These results indicate that these environmental factors play a role in the distribution of both neutral and putatively adaptive genetic diversity in the system. Moreover, polygenic selection was suggested by genotype-environment association analysis and significant correlations between additive polygenic scores and temperature and salinity. We discuss our results in the context of their conservation and management implications for the eastern oyster.",2019,"aquaculture; genomics; genotype by sequencing; oyster; population genetics; radseq","Article","ISI","no","NA","NA"
"Seascape genomics reveals adaptive divergence in a connected and commercially important mollusc, the greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata), along a longitudinal environmental gradient","10.1111/mec.14526","Sandoval-Castillo, J; Robinson, NA; Hart, AM; Strain, LWS; Beheregaray, LB","Populations of broadcast spawning marine organisms often have large sizes and are exposed to reduced genetic drift. Under such scenarios, strong selection associated with spatial environmental heterogeneity is expected to drive localized adaptive divergence, even in the face of connectivity. We tested this hypothesis using a seascape genomics approach in the commercially important greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata). We assessed how its population structure has been influenced by environmental heterogeneity along a zonal coastal boundary in southern Australia linked by strong oceanographic connectivity. Our data sets include 9,109 filtered SNPs for 371 abalones from 13 localities and environmental mapping across similar to 800 km. Genotype-environment association analyses and outlier tests defined 8,786 putatively neutral and 323 candidate adaptive loci. From a neutral perspective, the species is better represented by a metapopulation with very low differentiation (global F-ST = 0.0081) and weak isolation by distance following a stepping-stone model. For the candidate adaptive loci, however, model-based and model-free approaches indicated five divergent population clusters. After controlling for spatial distance, the distribution of putatively adaptive variation was strongly correlated to selection linked to minimum sea surface temperature and oxygen concentration. Around 80 candidates were annotated to genes with functions related to high temperature and/or low oxygen tolerance, including genes that influence the resilience of abalone species found in other biogeographic regions. Our study includes a documented example about the uptake of genomic information in fisheries management and supports the hypothesis of adaptive divergence due to coastal environmental heterogeneity in a connected metapopulation of a broadcast spawner.",2018,"climate change; ddrad-seq; ecological genomics; landscape genomics; marine protected areas (mpas); population connectivity; southern australia","Article","ISI","no","NA","NA"

Driven by the recent climatic changes, rapid northward shifts of species' distribution ranges can potentially modify the phylogeographic signature of Last Glacial Maximum. We explored this question in detail in the cold-tolerant kelp species Saccharina latissima, using microsatellites and double digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing ( ddRAD-seq) derived single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to analyze the genetic diversity and structure in 11 sites spanning the entire European Atlantic latitudinal range of this species. In addition, we checked for statistical correlation between genetic marker allele frequencies and three environmental proxies (sea surface temperature, salinity, and water turbidity). Our findings revealed that genetic diversity was significantly higher for the northernmost locality (Spitsbergen) compared to the southern ones (Northern Iberia), which we discuss in light of the current state of knowledge on phylogeography of S. latissima and the potential influence of the recent climatic changes on the population structure of this species. Seven SNPs and 12 microsatellite alleles were found to be significantly associated with at least one of the three environmental variables. We speculate on the putative adaptive functions of the genes associated with the outlier markers and the importance of these markers for successful conservation and aquaculture strategies for S. latissima in this age of rapid global change.",2020,"local adaptation; genetic diversity; outlier loci; environmental variables; phylogeography; snps and microsatellites","Article","ISI","no","NA","NA"
"Seascape genomics reveals candidate molecular targets of heat stress adaptation in three coral species","10.1111/mec.15857","Selmoni, O; Lecellier, G; Magalon, H; Vigliola, L; Oury, N; Benzoni, F; Peignon, C; Joost, S; Berteaux-Lecellier, V","Anomalous heat waves are causing a major decline of hard corals around the world and threatening the persistence of coral reefs. There are, however, reefs that have been exposed to recurrent thermal stress over the years and whose corals appear to have been tolerant against heat. One of the mechanisms that could explain this phenomenon is local adaptation, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly known. In this work, we applied a seascape genomics approach to study heat stress adaptation in three coral species of New Caledonia (southwestern Pacific) and to uncover the molecular actors potentially involved. We used remote sensing data to characterize the environmental trends across the reef system, and sampled corals living at the most contrasted sites. These samples underwent next generation sequencing to reveal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), frequencies of which were associated with heat stress gradients. As these SNPs might underpin an adaptive role, we characterized the functional roles of the genes located in their genomic region. In each of the studied species, we found heat stress-associated SNPs located in proximity of genes involved in pathways well known to contribute to the cellular responses against heat, such as protein folding, oxidative stress homeostasis, inflammatory and apoptotic pathways, and DNA damage-repair. In some cases, the same candidate molecular targets of heat stress adaptation recurred among species. Together, these results underline the relevance and the power of the seascape genomics approach for the discovery of adaptive traits that could allow corals to persist across wider thermal ranges.",2021,"coral bleaching; coral reef; heat stress; local adaptation; seascape genomics","Article","ISI","no","NA","NA"
"Seascape genomics reveals population isolation in the reef-building honeycomb worm,Sabellaria alveolata(L.)","10.1186/s12862-020-01658-9","Muir, AP; Dubois, SF; Ross, RE; Firth, LB; Knights, AM; Lima, FP; Seabra, R; Corre, E; Le Corguille, G; Nunes, FLD","Background Under the threat of climate change populations can disperse, acclimatise or evolve in order to avoid fitness loss. In light of this, it is important to understand neutral gene flow patterns as a measure of dispersal potential, but also adaptive genetic variation as a measure of evolutionary potential. In order to assess genetic variation and how this relates to environment in the honeycomb worm (Sabellaria alveolata(L.)), a reef-building polychaete that supports high biodiversity, we carried out RAD sequencing using individuals from along its complete latitudinal range. Patterns of neutral population genetic structure were compared to larval dispersal as predicted by ocean circulation modelling, and outlier analyses and genotype-environment association tests were used to attempt to identify loci under selection in relation to local temperature data. Results We genotyped 482 filtered SNPs, from 68 individuals across nine sites, 27 of which were identified as outliers using BAYESCAN and ARLEQUIN. All outlier loci were potentially under balancing selection, despite previous evidence of local adaptation in the system. Limited gene flow was observed among reef-sites (F-ST = 0.28 +/- 0.10), in line with the low dispersal potential identified by the larval dispersal models. The North Atlantic reef emerged as a distinct population and this was linked to high local larval retention and the effect of the North Atlantic Current on dispersal. Conclusions As an isolated population, with limited potential for natural genetic or demographic augmentation from other reefs, the North Atlantic site warrants conservation attention in order to preserve not only this species, but above all the crucial functional ecological roles that are associated with their bioconstructions.

"Seascape Genomics Reveals Metapopulation Connectivity Network of Paramuricea biscaya in the Northern Gulf of Mexico","10.3389/fmars.2021.790929","Galaska, MP; Liu, GP; West, D; Erickson, K; Quattrini, AM; Bracco, A; Herrera, S","The degree of connectivity among populations influences their ability to respond to natural and anthropogenic stressors. In marine systems, determining the scale, rate, and directionality of larval dispersal is therefore, central to understanding how coral metapopulations are interconnected and the degree of resiliency in the event of a localized disturbance. Understanding these source-sink dynamics is essential to guide restoration efforts and for the study of ecology and evolution in the ocean. The patterns and mechanisms of connectivity in the deep-sea (>200 m deep) are largely understudied. In this study, we investigated the spatial diversity patterns and metapopulation connectivity of the octocoral Paramuricea biscaya throughout the northern Gulf of Mexico (GoM). Paramuricea biscaya is one of the most abundant corals on the lower continental slope (between 1,200 and 2,500 m) in the GoM. The 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill (DWH) directly impacted populations of this species and thus are considered primary targets for restoration. We used a combination of seascape genomic analyses, high-resolution ocean circulation modeling, and larval dispersal simulations to quantify the degree of population structuring and connectivity among P. biscaya populations. Evidence supports the hypotheses that the genetic diversity of P. biscaya is structured by depth, and that larval dispersal among connected populations is asymmetric due to dominant ocean circulation patterns. Our results suggest that there are intermediate unsampled populations in the central GoM that serve as stepping stones for dispersal. The data suggest that the DeSoto Canyon area, and possibly the West Florida Escarpment, critically act as sources of larvae for areas impacted by the DWH oil spill in the Mississippi Canyon. This work illustrates that the management of deep-sea marine protected areas should incorporate knowledge of connectivity networks and depth-dependent processes throughout the water column.",2021,"population genomics; connectivity; gulf of mexico; coral; seascape genomics; radseq; dispersal; deep-sea","Article","ISI","no","NA","NA"

The viability of remnant populations remains uncertain and could be impacted by continued fishing and by-catch pressure, and the projected impacts of climate change. We genotyped 503 samples of D. batis, obtained opportunistically from the widest available geographic range, across 6 350 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using a reduced-representation sequencing approach. Genotypes were used to assess the species' contemporary population structure, estimate effective population sizes and identify putative signals of selection in relation to environmental variables using a seascape genomics approach. We identified genetic discontinuities between inshore (British Isles) and offshore (Rockall and Faroe Island) populations, with differentiation most pronounced across the deep waters of the Rockall Trough. Effective population sizes were largest in the Celtic Sea and Rockall, but low enough to be of potential conservation concern among Scottish and Faroese sites. Among the 21 candidate SNPs under positive selection was one significantly correlated with environmental variables predicted to be affected by climate change, including bottom temperature, salinity and pH. The paucity of well-annotated elasmobranch genomes precluded us from identifying a putative function for this SNP. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that climate change could inflict a strong selective force upon remnant populations of D. batis, further constraining its already-restricted habitat. Furthermore, the results provide fundamental insights on the distribution, behaviour and evolutionary biology of D. batis in the North-East Atlantic that will be useful for the establishment of conservation actions for this and other critically endangered elasmobranchs.",2022,"blue skate; climate change; conservation; dipturus batis; population genomics; seascape genomics","Article","ISI","no","NA","NA"

In this study, we assessed the relative importance of spatial distribution, ocean currents and sea surface temperature (SST) on patterns of putatively neutral and adaptive genetic variation among American lobster from 19 locations using population differentiation (PD) approaches combined with environmental association (EA) analyses. First, PD approaches (using BAYESCAN, ARLEQUIN and OUTFLANK) found 28 outlier SNPs putatively under divergent selection and 9770 neutral SNPs in common. Redundancy analysis revealed that spatial distribution, ocean current-mediated larval connectivity and SST explained 31.7% of the neutral genetic differentiation, with ocean currents driving the majority of this relationship (21.0%). After removing the influence of spatial distribution, no SST were significant for putatively neutral genetic variation whereas minimum annual SST still had a significant impact and explained 8.1% of the putatively adaptive genetic variation. Second, EA analyses (using Pearson correlation tests, BAYESCENV and LFMM) jointly identified seven SNPs as candidates for thermal adaptation. Covariation at these SNPs was assessed with a spatial multivariate analysis that highlighted a significant temperature association, after accounting for the influence of spatial distribution. Among the 505 candidate SNPs detected by at least one of the three approaches, we discovered three polymorphisms located in genes previously shown to play a role in thermal adaptation. Our results have implications for the management of the American lobster and provide a foundation on which to predict how this species will cope with climate change.",2016,"candidate gene; larval dispersal; marine invertebrate; radseq; seascape genetics; thermal adaptation","Article","ISI","no","NA","NA"

This is mediated by life-history traits such as the timing and frequency of spawning, larval behaviour and duration, and settlement success. Here, we use 1725 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to study the fine-scale spatial genetic structure in the commercially important cockle species Cerastoderma edule and compare it to environmental variables and current-mediated larval dispersal within a modelling framework. Hydrodynamic modelling employing the NEMO Atlantic Margin Model (AMM15) was used to simulate larval transport and estimate connectivity between populations during spawning months (April-September), factoring in larval duration and interannual variability of ocean currents. Results at neutral loci reveal the existence of three separate genetic clusters (mean F-ST = 0.021) within a relatively fine spatial scale in the north-west Atlantic. Environmental association analysis indicates that oceanographic currents and geographic proximity explain over 20% of the variance observed at neutral loci, while genetic variance (71%) at outlier loci was explained by sea surface temperature extremes.

The extensive coast of Northwestern Australia provides an emerging frontier for implementing new genomic tools to comparatively identify patterns of dispersal across diverse and extreme environmental conditions. Here, we focused on the stripey snapper (Lutjanus carponotatus), which is important to recreational, charter-based and customary fishers throughout the Indo-West Pacific. We collected 1,016 L.carponotatus samples at 51 locations in the coastal waters of Northwestern Australia ranging from the Northern Territory to Shark Bay and adopted a genotype-by-sequencing approach to test whether realized connectivity (via larval dispersal) was related to extreme gradients in coastal hydrodynamics. Hydrodynamic simulations using CONNIE and a more detailed treatment in the Kimberley Bioregion provided null models for comparison. Based on 4,402 polymorphic single nucleotide polymorphism loci shared across all individuals, we demonstrated significant genetic subdivision between the Shark Bay Bioregion in the south and all locations within the remaining, more northern bioregions. More importantly, we identified a zone of admixture spanning a distance of 180km at the border of the Kimberley and Canning bioregions, including the Buccaneer Archipelago and adjacent waters, which collectively experiences the largest tropical tidal range and some of the fastest tidal currents in the world. Further testing of the generality of this admixture zone in other shallow water species across broader geographic ranges will be critical for our understanding of the population dynamics and genetic structure of marine taxa in our tropical oceans.",2017,"biodiversity; coral reef; dartseq; environmental gradients; kimberley; marine","Article","ISI","no","NA","NA"

Coralligenous reefs are highly diverse habitats endemic to the Mediterranean Sea built by calcareous benthic organisms among which Crustose Coralline Algae are the main engineering species. We analyzed the diversity of Lithophyllum stictiforme or L. cabiochiae in coralligenous habitats combining a multiple barcode and a population genomics approach with seascape features. Population genomics allowed disentangling pure spatial effects from environmental effects. We found that these taxa form a complex of eight highly divergent cryptic species that are easily identifiable using classic barcode markers (psbA, LSU, COI). Three factors have a significant effect on the relative abundances of these cryptic species: the location along the French Mediterranean coast, depth and Photosynthetic Active Radiation (PAR). The analysis of around 5000 SNPs for the most abundant species revealed genetic differentiation among localities in the Bay of Marseille but no differentiation between depths within locality. Thus, the effect of depth and PAR on cryptic species communities is not a consequence of restricted connectivity but rather due to differential settlement or survival among cryptic species. This differential is more likely driven by irradiance levels rather than by pressure or temperature. Both the genetic and species diversity patterns are congruent with the main patterns of currents in the Bay. Ecological differentiation among these engineering cryptic species, sensitive to ocean warming and acidification, could have important consequences on the diversity and structure of the coralligenous communities.",2019,"engineering species; cryptic species; ecological niche; coralligenous habitats; ecological differentiation; crustose coralline algae","Article","ISI","no","NA","NA"
"A Few Stickleback Suffice for the Transport of Alleles to New Lakes","10.1534/g3.119.400564","Galloway, J; Cresko, WA; Ralph, P","Threespine stickleback populations provide a striking example of local adaptation to divergent habitats in populations that are connected by recurrent gene flow. These small fish occur in marine and freshwater habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere, and in numerous cases the smaller freshwater populations have been established de novo from marine colonists. Independently evolved freshwater populations exhibit similar phenotypes that have been shown to derive largely from the same standing genetic variants. Geographic isolation prevents direct migration between the freshwater populations, strongly suggesting that these shared locally adaptive alleles are transported through the marine population. However it is still largely unknown how gene flow, recombination, and selection jointly impact the standing variation that might fuel this adaptation. Here we use individual-based, spatially explicit simulations to determine the levels of gene flow that best match observed patterns of allele sharing among habitats in stickleback. We aim to better understand how gene flow and local adaptation in large metapopulations determine the speed of adaptation and re-use of standing genetic variation. In our simulations we find that repeated adaptation uses a shared set of alleles that are maintained at low frequency by migration-selection balance in oceanic populations. This process occurs over a realistic range of intermediate levels of gene flow that match previous empirical population genomic studies in stickleback. Examining these simulations more deeply reveals how lower levels of gene flow leads to slow, independent adaptation to different habitats, whereas higher levels of gene flow leads to significant mutation load - but an increased probability of successful population genomic scans for locally adapted alleles. Surprisingly, we find that the genealogical origins of most freshwater adapted alleles can be traced back to the original generation of marine individuals that colonized the lakes, as opposed to subsequent migrants. These simulations provide deeper context for existing studies of stickleback evolutionary genomics, and guidance for future empirical studies in this model. More broadly, our results support existing theory of local adaptation but extend it by more completely documenting the genealogical history of adaptive alleles in a metapopulation.",2020,"local adaptation; threespine stickleback; genomic simulation","Article","ISI","no","NA","NA"

Molecular ecological studies have been instrumental in advancing such understanding, and while initially focused primarily on broad-scale patterns, they have gradually uncovered the prevalence of local genetic structuring. Genomewide sequencing approaches have provided new opportunities to understand both neutral and adaptive contributions to this largely unexplained diversity, but fine-scale assessments have been hampered by challenges associated with aquatic environments, in terms of (geo)referencing, seafloor characterization, and in situ phenotyping. Here, we discuss the potential of reefscape genomics, leveraging recent advances in underwater imaging to enable spatially explicit genomic studies on coral reefs. More specifically, we consider how (close-range) photogrammetry approaches enable (1) fine scale spatial mapping of benthic target organisms, (2) repeatable characterization of the abiotic and biotic reefscape, and (3) simultaneous in situ mass-phenotyping. The spatially explicit consideration of genomic data -combined with detailed environmental and phenotypic characterization- opens up the opportunity for fine-scale landscape genomic approaches on coral reefs (and other marine ecosystems). Such approaches enable assessment of the spatio-temporal drivers and adaptive potential of the extensive genetic structuring and cryptic diversity encountered in benthic invertebrates, such as reef-building corals. Considering the threats that coral reefs are facing worldwide, we believe that reefscape genomics represents a promising advancement of our molecular ecological toolkit to help inform how we can most effectively conserve and restore coral reef ecosystems into the future.",2021,"reefscape genomics; seascape genomics; coral reefs; photogrammetry; structure from motion; landscape genomics","Article","ISI","no","NA","NA"

Population genomics and ecological niche modelling offer complementary new tools for uncovering functional units of phylogenetic diversity. We hypothesize that phylogenetically delineated lineages of gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) distributed across Antarctica and sub-Antarctic Islands are subject to spatially explicit ecological conditions that have limited gene flow, facilitating genetic differentiation, and thereby speciation processes. Location Antarctica and sub-Antarctic area. Methods We identify divergent lineages for gentoo penguins using ddRAD-seq and mtDNA, and generated species distribution models (SDMs) based on terrestrial and marine parameters. Results Analyses of our genomic data supports the existence of four major lineages of gentoo penguin: (i) spanning the sub-Antarctic archipelagos north of the Antarctic Polar Front (APF); (ii) Kerguelen Island; (iii) South America; and (iv) across maritime Antarctic and the Scotia Arc archipelagos. The APF, a major current system around Antarctica, acts as the most important barrier separating regional sister lineages. Our ecological analyses spanning both the terrestrial (breeding sites) and marine (feeding sites) realms recover limited niche overlap among the major lineages of gentoo penguin. We observe this pattern to correspond more closely with regional differentiation of marine conditions than to terrestrial macroenvironmental features. Main conclusions Recognition of regional genetic lineages as discrete evolutionary entities that occupy distinct ecological niches and also differ morphologically should be considered a priority for conservation.

Its browsing activity can deeply modify the littoral landscape, and changes in its abundance are of major conservation concern. This species is facing nowadays contrasting anthropogenic pressures linked to predator release, exploitation and sea warming. Management of this key species requires knowledge of its genetic structure, connectivity and local adaptation. Our goal was to assess the current global status of the species under a genomic perspective. Location Atlanto-Mediterranean shores from Morocco and France to Turkey. Methods We used genotyping by sequencing (GBS) of 241 individuals belonging to 11 populations spanning the known range of distribution of the species. We obtained 3,348 loci for population genomics and outlier analyses. Results We identified significant genetic structure and a gradient matching the longitudinal position of the localities. A hierarchical analysis revealed two main clusters (Atlantic and Mediterranean) and subtler patterns of differentiation within them. Candidate markers for selection identified between and within these two main clusters were mostly different, likely indicating different selective pressures. Adaptation to maximum salinity and maximum temperature appeared as an important driver of the transition between Atlantic and Mediterranean basins. Other stressors, such as minimum temperature or range of temperature, seem to define the structuring within the Mediterranean. Main conclusions Our study shows the potential of hierarchical analyses on population genomics to detect fine-scale genetic structure and adaptation signatures in marine species with long dispersal capabilities. Although genetic interchange occurs widely in Paracentrotus lividus, the species is sensitive to dispersal barriers, displays isolation by distance and faces local selective pressures associated to environmental conditions, all of which can render it more vulnerable than previously thought.",2020,"benthic communities; engineer species; genotyping by sequencing; oceanographic discontinuities; outlier analysis; population genomics; sea urchin","Article","ISI","no","NA","NA"

Arctic Char (Salvelinus alpinus) is an anadromous salmonid and the most harvested fish species by Inuit people, including in Nunavik (Quebec, Canada), one of the most recently deglaciated regions in the world. Unlike many other anadromous salmonids, Arctic Char occupy coastal habitats near their natal rivers during their short marine phase restricted to the summer ice-free period. Our main objective was to document putatively neutral and adaptive genomic variation in anadromous Arctic Char populations from Nunavik and bordering regions to inform local fisheries management. We used genotyping by sequencing (GBS) to genotype 18,112 filtered single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in 650 individuals from 23 sampling locations along >2000 km of coastline. Our results reveal a hierarchical genetic structure, whereby neighboring hydrographic systems harbor distinct populations grouped by major oceanographic basins: Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Ungava Bay, and Labrador Sea. We found genetic diversity and differentiation to be consistent both with the expected postglacial recolonization history and with patterns of isolation-by-distance reflecting contemporary gene flow.

Two shape-based morphotypes have been identified for the green turtle (Chelonia mydas) in the Pacific Ocean: the south-central/western or yellow turtle and north-central/eastern or black turtle. The genetic differentiation between these morphotypes and the adaptation of the black turtle to environmentally contrasting conditions of the eastern Pacific region has remained a mystery for decades. Here we addressed both questions using a reduced-representation genome approach (Dartseq; 9473 neutral SNPs) and identifying candidate outlier loci (67 outlier SNPs) of biological relevance between shape-based morphotypes from eight Pacific foraging grounds (n = 158). Our results support genetic divergence between morphotypes, probably arising from strong natal homing behaviour. Genes and enriched biological functions linked to thermoregulation, hypoxia, melanism, morphogenesis, osmoregulation, diet and reproduction were found to be outliers for differentiation, providing evidence for adaptation of C. mydas to the eastern Pacific region and suggesting independent evolutionary trajectories of the shape-based morphotypes. Our findings support the evolutionary distinctness of the enigmatic black turtle and contribute to the adaptive research and conservation genomics of a long-lived and highly mobile vertebrate.",2021,"chelonia mydas; genetic structure; candidate genes; melanism; eastern pacific; conservation genomics","Article","ISI","no","NA","NA"
"Whole genome genotyping reveals discrete genetic diversity in north-east Atlantic maerl beds","10.1111/eva.13219","Jenkins, TL; Guillemin, ML; Simon-Nutbrown, C; Burdett, HL; Stevens, JR; Pena, V","Maerl beds are vital habitats for a diverse array of marine species across trophic levels, but they are increasingly threatened by human activities and climate change. Furthermore, little is known about the genetic diversity of maerl-forming species and the population structure of maerl beds, both of which are important for understanding the ability of these species to adapt to changing environments and for informing marine reserve planning. In this study, we used a whole genome genotyping approach to explore the population genomics of Phymatolithon calcareum, a maerl-forming red algal species, whose geographical distribution spans the north-east Atlantic, from Norway to Portugal. Our results, using 14,150 genome-wide SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms), showed that P. calcareum maerl beds across the north-east Atlantic are generally structured geographically, a pattern likely explained by low dispersal potential and limited connectivity between regions. Additionally, we found that P. calcareum from the Fal Estuary, south-west England, is genetically distinct from all other P. calcareum sampled, even from The Manacles, a site located only 13 km away. Further analysis revealed that this finding is not the result of introgression from two closely related species, Phymatolithon purpureum or Lithothamnion corallioides. Instead, this unique diversity may have been shaped over time by geographical isolation of the Fal Estuary maerl bed and a lack of gene flow with other P. calcareum populations. The genomic data presented in this study suggest that P. calcareum genetic diversity has accumulated over large temporal and spatial scales, the preservation of which will be important for maximizing the resilience of this species to changes in climate and the environment. Moreover, our findings underline the importance of managing the conservation of maerl beds across western Europe as distinct units, at a site-by-site level.",2021,"conservation management; coralline algae; maerl; mitogenome; plastome; population genetic structure; rhodolith; single nucleotide polymorphism","Article","ISI","no","NA","NA"
"Genome-wide analysis of natural and restored eastern oyster populations reveals local adaptation and positive impacts of planting frequency and broodstock number","10.1111/eva.13322","Hornick, KM; Plough, LV","The release of captive-bred plants and animals has increased worldwide to augment declining species. However, insufficient attention has been given to understanding how neutral and adaptive genetic variation are partitioned within and among proximal natural populations, and the patterns and drivers of gene flow over small spatial scales, which can be important for restoration success. A seascape genomics approach was used to investigate population structure, local adaptation, and the extent to which environmental gradients influence genetic variation among natural and restored populations of Chesapeake Bay eastern oysters Crassostrea virginica. We also investigated the impact of hatchery practices on neutral genetic diversity of restored reefs and quantified the broader genetic impacts of large-scale hatchery-based bivalve restoration. Restored reefs showed similar levels of diversity as natural reefs, and striking relationships were found between planting frequency and broodstock numbers and genetic diversity metrics (effective population size and relatedness), suggesting that hatchery practices can have a major impact on diversity. Despite long-term restoration activities, haphazard historical translocations, and high dispersal potential of larvae that could homogenize allele frequencies among populations, moderate neutral population genetic structure was uncovered. Moreover, environmental factors, namely salinity, pH, and temperature, play a major role in the distribution of neutral and adaptive genetic variation. For marine invertebrates in heterogeneous seascapes, collecting broodstock from large populations experiencing similar environments to candidate sites may provide the most appropriate sources for restoration and ensure population resilience in the face of rapid environmental change. This is one of a few studies to demonstrate empirically that hatchery practices have a major impact on the retention of genetic diversity. Overall, these results contribute to the growing body of evidence for fine-scale genetic structure and local adaptation in broadcast-spawning marine species and provide novel information for the management of an important fisheries resource.",2022,"aquaculture; genomics; hatchery; local adaptation; oyster; radseq; restoration","Article","ISI","no","NA","NA"

Next-generation sequencing allows for thousands of genomic markers to be analyzed, which provides the resolution needed to address these questions in marine species with weakly differentiated populations. Greenland Halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) is one of the most important exploited demersal species throughout the North Atlantic, in particular in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada. There, two nurseries are known, the St. Lawrence Estuary and the northern Anticosti Island, but their contribution to the renewal of stocks remains unknown. The goals of this study were (a) to document the genetic structure and (b) to estimate the contribution of the different identified breeding stocks to nurseries. We sampled 100 juveniles per nursery and 50 adults from seven sites ranging from Saguenay Fjord to offshore Newfoundland, with some sites sampled over two consecutive years in order to evaluate the temporal stability of the contribution. Our results show that after removing sex-linked markers, the Estuary/Gulf of St. Lawrence represents a single stock which is genetically distinct from the Atlantic around Newfoundland (F-ST = 0.00146, p-value = .001). Population assignment showed that recruitment in both nurseries is predominantly associated with the St. Lawrence stock. However, we found that the relative contribution of both stocks to the nurseries is temporally variable with 1% contribution of the Newfoundland stock one year but up to 33% for the second year, which may be caused by year-to-year variation in larval transport into the Gulf of St. Lawrence. This study serves as a model for the identification of stocks for fisheries resources in a context where few barriers to dispersal occur, in addition to demonstrating the importance of considering sex-linked markers and temporal replicates in studies of population genomics.",2020,"greenland halibut; management; marine genomics; population assignment; stock identification; temporal stability","Article","ISI","no","NA","NA"
"Genomic signatures of environmental selection despite near-panmixia in summer flounder","10.1111/eva.12676","Hoey, JA; Pinsky, ML","Rapid environmental change is altering the selective pressures experienced by marine species. While adaptation to local environmental conditions depends on a balance between dispersal and natural selection across the seascape, the spatial scale of adaptation and the relative importance of mechanisms maintaining adaptation in the ocean are not well understood. Here, using population assignment tests, Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), and genome scans with double-digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing data, we evaluated population structure and locus-environment associations in a commercially important species, summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus), along the U.S. east coast. Based on 1,137 single nucleotide polymorphisms across 232 individuals spanning nearly 1,900 km, we found no indication of population structure across Cape Hatteras, North Carolina (F-ST=0.0014) or of isolation by distance along the coast using individual relatedness. ABC estimated the probability of dispersal across the biogeographic break at Cape Hatteras to be high (95% credible interval: 7%-50% migration). However, we found 15 loci whose allele frequencies were associated with at least one of four environmental variables. Of those, 11 were correlated with bottom temperature. For summer flounder, our results suggest continued fisheries management as a single population and identify likely response mechanisms to climate change. Broadly speaking, our findings suggest that spatial balancing selection can manifest in adaptive divergence on regional scales in marine fish despite high dispersal, and that these conditions likely result in the widespread distribution of adaptive alleles and a high potential for future genetic adaptation in response to changing environmental conditions. In the context of a rapidly changing world, a landscape genomics perspective offers a useful approach for understanding the causes and consequences of genetic differentiation.",2018,"adaptation; ddradseq; genome scan; population structure; spatial balancing selection; summer flounder","Article","ISI","no","NA","NA"
"Combining six genome scan methods to detect candidate genes to salinity in the Mediterranean striped red mullet (Mullus surmuletus)","10.1186/s12864-018-4579-z","Dalongeville, A; Benestan, L; Mouillot, D; Lobreaux, S; Manel, S","Background: Adaptive genomics may help predicting how a species will respond to future environmental changes. Genomic signatures of local adaptation in marine organisms are often driven by environmental selective agents impacting the physiology of organisms. With one of the highest salinity level, the Mediterranean Sea provides an excellent model to investigate adaptive genomic divergence underlying salinity adaptation. In the present study, we combined six genome scan methods to detect potential genomic signal of selection in the striped red mullet (Mullus surmuletus) populations distributed across a wide salinity gradient. We then blasted these outlier sequences on published fish genomic resources in order to identify relevant potential candidate genes for salinity adaptation in this species. Results: Altogether, the six genome scan methods found 173 outliers out of 1153 SNPs. Using a blast approach, we discovered four candidate SNPs belonging to three genes potentially implicated in adaptation of M. surmuletus to salinity. The allele frequency at one of these SNPs significantly increases with salinity independently from the effect of longitude. The gene associated to this SNP, SOCS2, encodes for an inhibitor of cytokine and has previously been shown to be expressed under osmotic pressure in other marine organisms. Additionally, our results showed that genome scan methods not correcting for spatial structure can still be an efficient strategy to detect potential footprints of selection, when the spatial and environmental variation are confounded, and then, correcting for spatial structure in a second step represents a conservative method. Conclusion: The present outcomes bring evidences of potential genomic footprint of selection, which suggest an adaptive response of M. surmuletus to salinity conditions in the Mediterranean Sea. Additional genomic data such as sequencing of a full-genome and transcriptome analyses of gene expression would provide new insights regarding the possibility that some striped red mullet populations are locally adapted to their saline environment.",2018,"adaptive genomics; genome scan; candidate genes; mediterranean sea; mullus surmuletus; salinity","Article","ISI","no","NA","NA"

The edible cockle (Cerastoderma edule) is a marine bivalve distributed along the Northeast Atlantic coast of Europe and is an important resource from both commercial and ecological perspectives. We performed a population genomics screening using 2b-RAD genotyping on 9309 SNPs localized in the cockle's genome on a sample of 536 specimens pertaining to 14 beds in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean to analyse the genetic structure with regard to environmental variables. Larval dispersal modelling considering species behaviour and interannual/interseasonal variation in ocean conditions was carried out as an essential background to which compare genetic information. Cockle populations in the Northeast Atlantic displayed low but significant geographical differentiation between populations (F-ST = 0.0240; p < 0.001), albeit not across generations. We identified 742 and 36 outlier SNPs related to divergent and balancing selection in all the geographical scenarios inspected, and sea temperature and salinity were the main environmental correlates suggested. Highly significant linkage disequilibrium was detected at specific genomic regions against the very low values observed across the whole genome. Two main genetic groups were identified, northwards and southwards of French Brittany. Larval dispersal modelling suggested a barrier for larval dispersal linked to the Ushant front that could explain these two genetic clusters. Further genetic subdivision was observed using outlier loci and considering larval advection. The northern group was divided into the Irish/Celtic Seas and the English Channel/North Sea, while the southern group was divided into three subgroups.

The main goal of this study was to assess how a population genomics framework could help delineate the genetic structure of the American lobster (Homarus americanus) throughout much of the species' range and increase the assignment success of individuals to their location of origin. We genotyped 10156 filtered SNPs using RAD sequencing to delineate genetic structure and perform population assignment for 586 American lobsters collected in 17 locations distributed across a large portion of the species' natural distribution range. Our results revealed the existence of a hierarchical genetic structure, first separating lobsters from the northern and southern part of the range (F-CT=0.0011; P-value=0.0002) and then revealing a total of 11 genetically distinguishable populations (mean F-ST=0.00185; CI: 0.0007-0.0021, P-value<0.0002), providing strong evidence for weak, albeit fine-scale population structuring within each region. A resampling procedure showed that assignment success was highest with a subset of 3000 SNPs having the highest F-ST. Applying Anderson's (Molecular Ecology Resources, 2010, 10, 701) method to avoid high-grading bias', 94.2% and 80.8% of individuals were correctly assigned to their region and location of origin, respectively. Lastly, we showed that assignment success was positively associated with sample size. These results demonstrate that using a large number of SNPs improves fine-scale population structure delineation and population assignment success in a context of weak genetic structure.

"Genetic differentiation and signatures of local adaptation revealed by RADseq for a highly dispersive mud crab Scylla olivacea (Herbst, 1796) in the Sulu Sea","10.1002/ece3.7625","Mendiola, MJR; Ravago-Gotanco, R","Connectivity of marine populations is shaped by complex interactions between biological and physical processes across the seascape. The influence of environmental features on the genetic structure of populations has key implications for the dynamics and persistence of populations, and an understanding of spatial scales and patterns of connectivity is crucial for management and conservation. This study employed a seascape genomics approach combining larval dispersal modeling and population genomic analysis using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) obtained from RADseq to examine environmental factors influencing patterns of genetic structure and connectivity for a highly dispersive mud crab Scylla olivacea (Herbst, 1796) in the Sulu Sea. Dispersal simulations reveal widespread but asymmetric larval dispersal influenced by persistent southward and westward surface circulation features in the Sulu Sea. Despite potential for widespread dispersal across the Sulu Sea, significant genetic differentiation was detected among eight populations based on 1,655 SNPs (F-ST = 0.0057, p < .001) and a subset of 1,643 putatively neutral SNP markers (F-ST = 0.0042, p < .001). Oceanography influences genetic structure, with redundancy analysis (RDA) indicating significant contribution of asymmetric ocean currents to neutral genetic variation (Radj2 = 0.133, p = .035). Genetic structure may also reflect demographic factors, with divergent populations characterized by low effective population sizes (N-e < 50). Pronounced latitudinal genetic structure was recovered for loci putatively under selection (F-ST = 0.2390, p < .001), significantly correlated with sea surface temperature variabilities during peak spawning months for S. olivacea (Radj2 = 0.692-0.763; p < .050), suggesting putative signatures of selection and local adaptation to thermal clines. While oceanography and dispersal ability likely shape patterns of gene flow and genetic structure of S. olivacea across the Sulu Sea, the impacts of genetic drift and natural selection influenced by sea surface temperature also appear as likely drivers of population genetic structure.

In this context, it is crucial to gather biological and ecological information of the main species in marine communities to predict and mitigate potential effects of shifts in their distribution, abundance, and interactions. Using genotyping by sequencing (GBS), we assessed the genetic structure of a keystone species in the Mediterranean shallow littoral ecosystems, the black sea urchin Arbacia lixula. This bioengineer species can shape their communities due to its grazing activity and it is experiencing an ongoing expansion with increasing temperatures. The population genomic analyses on 5,241 loci sequenced in 240 individuals from 11 Mediterranean sampled populations revealed that all populations were diverse and showed significant departure from equilibrium. Albeit genetic differentiation was in general shallow, a significant break separated the western and eastern Mediterranean populations, a break not detected in previous studies with less resolutive markers. Notably, no clear effect of the Almeria-Oran front, an important break in the Atlanto-Mediterranean transition, could be detected among the western basin populations, where only a slight differentiation of the two northernmost populations was found. Despite the generally low levels of genetic differentiation found, we identified candidate regions for local adaptation by combining different genomic analysis with environmental data.

In this study, we explored connectivity patterns of a marine species with long-distance dispersal, the edible common sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus, focusing mainly on the Adriatic-Ionian basins (Central Mediterranean). We applied a multidisciplinary approach integrating population genomics, based on 1,122 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) obtained from 2b-RAD in 275 samples, with Lagrangian simulations performed with a biophysical model of larval dispersal. We detected genetic homogeneity among eight population samples collected in the focal Adriatic-Ionian area, whereas weak but significant differentiation was found with respect to two samples from the Western Mediterranean (France and Tunisia). This result was not affected by the few putative outlier loci identified in our dataset. Lagrangian simulations found a significant potential for larval exchange among the eight Adriatic-Ionian locations, supporting the hypothesis of connectivity of P.lividus populations in this area. A peculiar pattern emerged from the comparison of our results with those obtained from published P.lividus cytochrome b (cytb) sequences, the latter revealing genetic differentiation in the same geographic area despite a smaller sample size and a lower power to detect differences.

We investigated the global population genomics of tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier), a circumglobally distributed, apex predator displaying remarkable behavioral versatility in its diet, habitat use (near coastal, coral reef, pelagic), and individual movement patterns (spatially resident to long-distance migrations). We genotyped 242 tiger sharks from 10 globally distributed locations at more than 2000 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Although this species often conducts massive distance migrations, the data show strong genetic differentiation at both neutral (FST = 0.125-0.144) and candidate outlier loci (F-ST = 0.570-0.761) between western Atlantic and Indo-Pacific sharks, suggesting the potential for adaptation to the environments specific to these oceanic regions. Within these regions, there was mixed support for population differentiation between northern and southern hemispheres in the western Atlantic, and none for structure within the Indian Ocean. Notably, the results demonstrate a low level of population differentiation of tiger sharks from the remote Hawaiian archipelago compared with sharks from the Indian Ocean (F-ST = 0.003-0.005, P < 0.01). Given concerns about biodiversity loss and marine ecosystem impacts caused by overfishing of oceanic sharks in the midst of rapid environmental change, our results suggest it imperative that international fishery management prioritize conservation of the evolutionary potential of the highly genetically differentiated Atlantic and Indo-Pacific populations of this unique apex predator.

Among those, copy number variants (CNVs), including duplicated genomic regions and transposable elements (TEs), may contribute to local adaptation and/or reproductive isolation among divergent populations. Those mechanisms suppose that CNVs could be used to infer neutral and/or adaptive population genetic structure, whose study has been restricted to microsatellites, mitochondrial DNA and Amplified fragment length polymorphism markers in the past and more recently the use of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Taking advantage of recent developments allowing CNV analysis from RAD-seq data, we investigated how variation in fitness-related traits, local environmental conditions and demographic history are associated with CNVs, and how subsequent copy number variation drives population genetic structure in a marine fish, the capelin (Mallotus villosus). We collected 1538 DNA samples from 35 sampling sites in the north Atlantic Ocean and identified 6620 putative CNVs. We found associations between CNVs and the gonadosomatic index, suggesting that six duplicated regions could affect female fitness by modulating oocyte production. We also detected 105 CNV candidates associated with water temperature, among which 20% corresponded to genomic regions located within the sequence of protein-coding genes, suggesting local adaptation to cold water by means of gene sequence amplification. We also identified 175 CNVs associated with the divergence of three previously defined parapatric glacial lineages, of which 24% were located within protein-coding genes, making those loci potential candidates for reproductive isolation. Lastly, our analyses unveiled a hierarchical, complex CNV population structure determined by temperature and local geography, which was in stark contrast to that inferred based on SNPs in a previous study.

However, the distinctive biological characteristics and life history of this species, including large body size, long life span, late sexual maturity, and specialization to freezing polar waters, make it particularly vulnerable to overfishing and global climate change. It is therefore of fundamental importance to administer sound management and conservation actions to avoid depletion of this unique species. The crucial issue of whether this species consists of distinct biological units or stocks, which is needed to inform appropriate management and conservation, is currently unresolved. We report here the first RAD-seq analysis of Antarctic toothfish populations, a powerful approach of genome-wide discovery of SNP loci, to assess genetic differentiation between the geographically distant individuals from CCAMLAR Subarea 48.1 locations (South Shetland Islands and West Antarctic Peninsula coasts) and Subarea 88.1 (Ross Sea and McMurdo Sound). We recovered 19,611 SNPs belonging to 13,251 widely shared loci. Comprehensive population structure analyses unambiguously indicated absence of any significant level of population differentiation, thus the null hypothesis of panmixia cannot be rejected. Together with currently known life history traits of D. mawsoni, we suggest this striking lack of genomic differentiation likely reflects high degrees of contemporary and/or historical gene flow rather than shared spawning grounds.

Here, 4,122 SNP-containing loci were used to assess structure in southern flounder (Paralichthys lethostigma) sampled across its range in the US Atlantic Ocean (Atlantic) and Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) and relationships among components of genomic variation and spatial and environmental variables were assessed across estuarine population samples in the Gulf. While hierarchical Amova revealed significant heterogeneity within and between the Atlantic and Gulf, pairwise comparisons between samples within ocean basins demonstrated that all significant heterogeneity occurred within the Gulf. The distribution of Tajima's D estimated at a genome-wide scale differed significantly from equilibrium in all estuaries, with more negative values occurring in the Gulf. Components of genomic variation were significantly associated with environmental variables describing individual estuaries, and environment explained a larger component of variation than spatial proximity. Overall, results suggest that there is genetic spatial autocorrelation caused by shared larval sources for proximal nurseries (migration/drift), but that it is modified by environmentally driven differentiation (selection).

"Identification of putative key genes for thermal adaptation in the Japanese mantis shrimp (Oratosquilla oratoria) through population genomic analysis","10.1016/j.cbd.2021.100828","Lou F., Gao T., Han Z.","Little is known about the mechanisms underlying the relationship between genetic variation and the adaptation of Oratosquilla oratoria populations to different habitat temperature. Here, the genome-wide genetic information of three O. oratoria populations were obtained by IIB restriction site-associated DNA (2b-RAD) sequencing and 2403 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified. Based on the 2403 SNPs, we found a remarkable genetic differentiation between the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea groups of O. oratoria. Furthermore, 63 SNPs are thought to be associated with different sea temperatures. Based on the 63 SNPs, it is hypothesised that the long-term temperature differences may contribute to the variation of genes associated with multiple biological functions, such as material metabolism, cytoskeleton, cellular processes, inflammatory response and hormonal regulation.

While theory predicts how and when populations at range margins are likely to undergo local adaptation, empirical evidence testing these models remains sparse. Here, we address this knowledge gap by investigating the relationship between selection, gene flow and genetic drift in the yellowtail clownfish, Amphiprion clarkii, from the core to the northern periphery of the species range. Analyses reveal low genetic diversity at the range edge, gene flow from the core to the edge and genomic signatures of local adaptation at 56 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 25 candidate genes, most of which are significantly correlated with minimum annual sea surface temperature. Several of these candidate genes play a role in functions that are upregulated during cold stress, including protein turnover, metabolism and translation. Our results illustrate how spatially divergent selection spanning the range core to the periphery can occur despite the potential for strong genetic drift at the range edge and moderate gene flow from the core populations. © 2021 The Author(s).",2021,"clownfish; local adaptation; range margin; spatially divergent selection","Article","SCOPUS","no","NA","NA"
"Local environment-driven adaptive evolution in a marine invasive ascidian (Molgula manhattensis)","10.1002/ece3.7322","Chen Y., Gao Y., Huang X., Li S., Zhan A.","Elucidating molecular mechanisms of environment-driven adaptive evolution in marine invaders is crucial for understanding invasion success and further predicting their future invasions. Although increasing evidence suggests that adaptive evolution could contribute to organisms’ adaptation to varied environments, there remain knowledge gaps regarding how environments influence genomic variation in invaded habitats and genetic bases underlying local adaptation for most marine invaders. Here, we performed restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) to assess population genetic diversity and further investigate genomic signatures of local adaptation in the marine invasive ascidian, Molgula manhattensis. We revealed that most invasive populations exhibited significant genetic differentiation, low recent gene flow, and no signal of significant population bottleneck. Based on three genome scan approaches, we identified 109 candidate loci potentially under environmental selection. Redundancy analysis and variance partitioning analysis suggest that local environmental factors, particularly the salinity-related variables, represent crucial evolutionary forces in driving adaptive divergence. Using the newly developed transcriptome as a reference, 14 functional genes were finally obtained with potential roles in salinity adaptation, including SLC5A1 and SLC9C1 genes from the solute carrier gene (SLC) superfamily. Our findings confirm that differed local environments could rapidly drive adaptive divergence among invasive populations and leave detectable genomic signatures in marine invaders. © 2021 The Authors.

"Adaptive markers distinguish North and South Pacific Albacore amid low population differentiation","10.1111/eva.13202","Vaux F., Bohn S., Hyde J.R., O'Malley K.G.","Albacore (Thunnus alalunga) support an economically valuable global fishery, but surprisingly little is known about the population structure of this highly migratory species. Physical tagging data suggest that Albacore from the North and South Pacific Ocean are separate stocks, but results from previous genetic studies did not support this two stock hypothesis. In addition, observed biological differences among juveniles suggest that there may be population substructure in the North Pacific. We used double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing to assess population structure among 308 Albacore caught in 12 sample areas across the Pacific Ocean (10 North, 2 South). Since Albacore are highly migratory and spawning areas are unknown, sample groups were not assumed to be equivalent to populations and the genetic data were analyzed iteratively. We tested for putatively adaptive differences among groups and for genetic variation associated with sex. Results indicated that Albacore in the North and South Pacific can be distinguished using 84 putatively adaptive loci, but not using the remaining 12,788 presumed neutral sites. However, two individuals likely represent F1 hybrids between the North and South Pacific populations, and 43 Albacore potentially exhibit lower degrees of mixed ancestry. In addition, four or five cross-hemisphere migrants were potentially identified. No genetic evidence was found for population substructure within the North Pacific, and no loci appeared to distinguish males from females. Potential functions for the putatively adaptive loci were identified, but an annotated Albacore genome is required for further exploration. Future research should try to locate spawning areas so that life history, demography, and genetic population structure can be linked and spatiotemporal patterns can be investigated. © 2021 The Authors.

"Concordant geographic and genetic structure revealed by genotyping-by-sequencing in a New Zealand marine isopod","10.1002/ece3.6802","Pearman W.S., Wells S.J., Silander O.K., Freed N.E., Dale J.","Population genetic structure in the marine environment can be influenced by life-history traits such as developmental mode (biphasic, with distinct adult and larval morphology, and direct development, in which larvae resemble adults) or habitat specificity, as well as geography and selection. Developmental mode is thought to significantly influence dispersal, with direct developers expected to have much lower dispersal potential. However, this prediction can be complicated by the presence of geophysical barriers to dispersal. In this study, we use a panel of 8,020 SNPs to investigate population structure and biogeography over multiple spatial scales for a direct-developing species, the New Zealand endemic marine isopod Isocladus armatus. Because our sampling range is intersected by two well-known biogeographic barriers (the East Cape and the Cook Strait), our study provides an opportunity to understand how such barriers influence dispersal in direct developers. On a small spatial scale (20 km), gene flow between locations is extremely high, suggestive of an island model of migration. However, over larger spatial scales (600 km), populations exhibit a clear pattern of isolation-by-distance. Our results indicate that I. armatus exhibits significant migration across the hypothesized barriers and suggest that large-scale ocean currents associated with these locations do not present a barrier to dispersal. Interestingly, we find evidence of a north-south population genetic break occurring between Mahia and Wellington. While no known geophysical barrier is apparent in this area, it coincides with the location of a proposed border between bioregions. Analysis of loci under selection revealed that both isolation-by-distance and adaption may be contributing to the degree of population structure we have observed here. We conclude that developmental life history largely predicts dispersal in the intertidal isopod I. armatus. However, localized biogeographic processes can disrupt this expectation, and this may explain the potential meta-population detected in the Auckland region. © 2020 The Authors.

The black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon), is widely distributed throughout the Indian and Pacific Oceans including along the western, northern and eastern coastline of Australia, where it is an important aquaculture and fishery species. Understanding the genetic structure and the influence of environmental factors leading to adaptive differences among populations of this species is important for farm genetic improvement programs and sustainable fisheries management. Results: Based on 278 individuals obtained from seven geographically disparate Australian locations, 10,624 high-quality SNP loci were used to characterize genetic diversity, population structure, genetic connectivity, and adaptive divergence. Significant population structure and differentiation were revealed among wild populations (average F ST = 0.001-0.107; p < 0.05). Eighty-nine putatively outlier SNPs were identified to be potentially associated with environmental variables by using both population differentiation (BayeScan and PCAdapt) and environmental association (redundancy analysis and latent factor mixed model) analysis methods. Clear population structure with similar spatial patterns were observed in both neutral and outlier markers with three genetically distinct groups identified (north Queensland, Northern Territory, and Western Australia). Redundancy, partial redundancy, and multiple regression on distance matrices analyses revealed that both geographical distance and environmental factors interact to generate the structure observed across Australian P. monodon populations. Conclusion: This study provides new insights on genetic population structure of Australian P. monodon in the face of environmental changes, which can be used to advance sustainable fisheries management and aquaculture breeding programs. © 2020 The Author(s).",2020,"aquaculture; functional annotation; genotype-environment interaction; population genetics; prawn","Article","SCOPUS","no","NA","NA"

Furthermore, structural variation as chromosomal rearrangements may facilitate adaptation despite high gene flow. However, our understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms impending or favouring local adaptation in the presence of gene flow is still limited to a restricted number of study systems. In this study, we examined how demographic history, shared ancestral polymorphism, and gene flow among glacial lineages contribute to local adaptation to sea conditions in a marine fish, the capelin (Mallotus villosus). We first assembled a 490-Mbp draft genome of M. villosus to map our RAD sequence reads. Then, we used a large data set of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (25,904 filtered SNPs) genotyped in 1,310 individuals collected from 31 spawning sites in the northwest Atlantic. We reconstructed the history of divergence among three glacial lineages and showed that they probably diverged from 3.8 to 1.8 million years ago and experienced secondary contacts. Within each lineage, our analyses provided evidence for large Ne and high gene flow among spawning sites. Within the Northwest Atlantic lineage, we detected a polymorphic chromosomal rearrangement leading to the occurrence of three haplogroups. Genotype–environment associations revealed molecular signatures of local adaptation to environmental conditions prevailing at spawning sites. Our study also suggests that both shared polymorphisms among lineages, resulting from standing genetic variation or introgression, and chromosomal rearrangements may contribute to local adaptation in the presence of high gene flow. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",2020,"fish; inversion; joint site frequency spectrum; mallotus villosus; population genomics; rad; speciation; dadi","Article","SCOPUS","no","chromosome invertion","NA"

In north-western Australia, trochus are taken from inshore reefs by Indigenous Australians and oceanic reefs by artisanal Indonesian fishers. The management of these environmentally distinct regions relies on understanding their spatial interdependencies, yet connectivity between them has not been evaluated empirically. Here, we used genotype-by-sequencing analysis of 514 trochus samples collected from 17 locations (15 in the inshore Kimberley, 2 offshore oceanic sites). Analysis of 5428 polymorphic single nucleotide polymorphism loci revealed significant genetic subdivision between the oceanic and coastal sites, and a subset of loci exhibited significantly higher subdivision, suggesting they are subject to directional selection. Population differentiation was also evident between the two oceanic sites, but not between coastal sites. Trochus populations from the coastal Kimberley and oceanic reefs represent two genetically and demographically independent units, with preliminary evidence for local adaptation to these distinctive environments. Management strategies for R. nilotica reflect these divisions, but the limited connectivity among oceanic populations indicates that they are vulnerable to overexploitation. Furthermore, their potential adaptive distinctiveness indicates that coastal stocks may be unsuitable for replenishing oceanic stocks. © 2020 CSIRO.",2020,"fisheries management; genomic; population connectivity; tectus; trochus","Article","SCOPUS","no","NA","NA"

It has been widely accepted that populations of marine fishes are highly connected owing to fewer barriers to gene flow and increased connectivity resulting from greater dispersal abilities. Since population genomic approaches have increased the accessibility and resolution of population genetic data, it further facilitates to study and detect previously unidentified structures as well as signatures for natural selection in wild populations. In the present study, restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing was applied to the samples of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of Engraulis japonicus, a small pelagic fish of ecological and economic importance in the northwestern Pacific. To assess population genetic structure as well as detection for local adaptation of E. japonicus, a total of 389 individuals from six regional populations of the northwestern Pacific were collected and a set of 12,627 SNPs was developed. Marginal significant genetic structure (average FST value was approximately equal to 0.002) was detected between regional populations of “the Bohai Sea population (BHS)” and the “the Japan Sea population (JPS)” as well as between “the North Yellow Sea population (NYS),” and the “the Japan Sea population (JPS)”. Moreover, no sign of local adaptation was detected, which might be the product of high gene flow among regional populations.

"Divergent northern and southern populations and demographic history of the pearl oyster in the western Pacific revealed with genomic SNPs","10.1111/eva.12905","Takeuchi T., Masaoka T., Aoki H., Koyanagi R., Fujie M., Satoh N.","In the open ocean without terrain boundaries, marine invertebrates with pelagic larvae can migrate long distances using ocean currents, suggesting reduced genetic diversification. Contrary to this assumption, however, genetic differentiation is often observed in marine invertebrates. In the present study, we sought to explain how population structure is established in the western Pacific Ocean, where the strong Kuroshio Current maintains high levels of gene flow from south to north, presumably promoting genetic homogeneity. We determined the population structure of the pearl oyster, Pinctada fucata, in the Indo-Pacific Ocean using genome-wide genotyping data from multiple sampling localities. Cluster analysis showed that the western Pacific population is distinct from that of the Indian Ocean, and that it is divided into northern (Japanese mainland) and southern (Nansei Islands, China, and Cambodia) populations. Genetic differentiation of P. fucata can be explained by geographic barriers in the Indian Ocean and a local lagoon, and by environmental gradients of sea surface temperature (SST) and oxygen concentration in the western Pacific. A genome scan showed evidence of adaptive evolution in genomic loci, possibly associated with changes in environmental factors, including SST and oxygen concentration. Furthermore, Bayesian simulation demonstrated that the past population expansion and division are congruent with ocean warming after the last glacial period. It is highly likely that the environmental gradient forms a genetic barrier that diversifies P. fucata populations in the western Pacific.

Genetic diversity is an important determinant of population fitness and resilience, and can require careful management to ensure sufficient variation is present. In addition, population genetics data reveal patterns of connectivity and gene flow between locations, enabling mangers to predict recovery and resilience, identify areas of local adaptation, and generate restoration plans. Here, we demonstrate a conservation genetics approach to inform restoration and management of the loggerhead sponge (Spheciospongia vesparium) in the Florida Keys, USA. This species is a dominant, habitat-forming component of marine ecosystems in the Caribbean region, but in Florida has suffered numerous mass mortality events. We developed microsatellite markers and used them to genotype sponges from 14 locations in Florida and a site each in The Bahamas, Belize and Barbuda. We found that genetic diversity levels were similar across all sites, but inbreeding and bottleneck signatures were present in Florida. Populations are highly structured at the regional scale, whilst within Florida connectivity is present in a weak isolation by distance pattern, coupled with chaotic genetic patchiness. Evidence of a weak barrier to gene flow was found in Florida among sites situated on opposite sides of the islands in the Middle Keys. Loggerhead sponge populations in Florida are vulnerable in the face of mass mortalities due to low connectivity with other areas in the region, as well as distance-limited and unpredictable local connectivity patterns. However, our discovery of Florida’s high genetic diversity increases hope for resilience to future perturbations.

FST, clustering, and outlier analyses support a genetically cohesive population spanning the Celtic Sea-English Channel-North Sea-Kattegat (NE Atlantic) region. The lack of structure among the NE Atlantic samples indicates connectivity across current management boundaries. However, the assumption of demographic panmixia is cautioned against unless verified by a multidisciplinary approach. The data confirm high genetic divergence of a Baltic population (average FST vs. NE Atlantic samples ¼ 0.051) with signatures compatible with local adaptation in the form of outlier loci, some of which are shown to occur within exonic regions. The outliers permit diagnostic assignment of individuals between the NE Atlantic and Baltic populations and thus represent a “reduced panel” of markers for monitoring a potential mixed stock fishery within the western Baltic.

"Evolution of population structure in an estuarine-dependent marine fish","10.1002/ece3.4936","Hollenbeck C.M., Portnoy D.S., Gold J.R.","Restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing was used to characterize neutral and adaptive genetic variation among geographic samples of red drum, Sciaenops ocellatus, an estuarine-dependent fish found in coastal waters along the southeastern coast of the United States (Atlantic) and the northern Gulf of Mexico (Gulf). Analyses of neutral and outlier loci revealed three genetically distinct regional clusters: one in the Atlantic and two in the northern Gulf. Divergence in neutral loci indicated gradual genetic change and followed a linear pattern of isolation by distance. Divergence in outlier loci was at least an order of magnitude greater than divergence in neutral loci, and divergence between the regions in the Gulf was twice that of divergence between other regions. Discordance in patterns of genetic divergence between outlier and neutral loci is consistent with the hypothesis that the former reflects adaptive responses to environmental factors that vary on regional scales, while the latter largely reflects drift processes. Differences in basic habitat, initiated by glacial retreat and perpetuated by contemporary oceanic and atmospheric forces interacting with the geomorphology of the northern Gulf, followed by selection, appear to have led to reduced gene flow among red drum across the northern Gulf, reinforcing differences accrued during isolation and resulting in continued divergence across the genome.

To address this knowledge gap, genomic analysis (11 101 SNPs) was performed on samples from Atlantic and Indian Ocean spawning sites, including SAF sites spanning the current stock boundary. Outlier loci conferred high discriminatory power to assignment tests and revealed that all SAF fish were assigned to the Indian Ocean population and that no Atlantic Ocean fish appeared in the SAF samples. Additionally, several Indian Ocean migrants were detected at the Atlantic spawning site demonstrating asymmetric dispersal and the occurrence of a mixed-stock fishery in Atlantic waters. This study highlights both the spatial inaccuracy of current stock designations and a misunderstanding of interactions between the underlying biological units, which must be addressed in light of local and global declines of the species.

Our findings show that at-sea range and oceanography underlie patterns of dispersal in these penguins. The pelagic niche of emperor (Aptenodytes forsteri), king (A. patagonicus), Adélie (Pygoscelis adeliae) and chinstrap (P. antarctica) penguins facilitates gene flow over thousands of kilometres. In contrast, the coastal niche of gentoo penguins (P. papua) limits dispersal, resulting in population divergences. Oceanographic fronts also act as dispersal barriers to some extent.

Annual catches in commercial fisheries are in serious decline, which has resulted in calls for the development of an integrated stock management approach. In Oman, the scalloped spiny lobster is currently treated as a single management unit (MU) or stock and there is an absence of information on the genetic population structure of the species that can inform management decisions, particularly at a fine-scale level. This work is the first to identify genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for P. homarus using Diversity Arrays Technology sequencing (DArT-seq) and to elucidate any stock structure in the species. Results: After stringent filtering, 7988 high utility SNPs were discovered and used to assess the genetic diversity, connectivity and structure of P. homarus populations from Al Ashkharah, Masirah Island, Duqm, Ras Madrakah, Haitam, Ashuwaymiyah, Mirbat and Dhalkut landing sites. Pairwise F ST estimates revealed low differentiation among populations (pairwise F ST range = - 0.0008 - 0.0021). Analysis of genetic variation using putatively directional F ST outliers (504 SNPs) revealed higher and significant pairwise differentiation (p &lt; 0.01) for all locations, with Ashuwaymiyah being the most diverged population (Ashuwaymiyah pairwise F ST range = 0.0288-0.0736). Analysis of population structure using Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC) revealed a broad admixture among P. homarus, however, Ashuwaymiyah stock appeared to be potentially under local adaptive pressures. Fine scale analysis using Netview R provided further support for the general admixture of P. homarus. Conclusions: Findings here suggested that stocks of P. homarus along the Omani coastline are admixed. Yet, fishery managers need to treat the lobster stock from Ashuwaymiyah with caution as it might be subject to local adaptive pressures. We emphasize further study with larger number of samples to confirm the genetic status of the Ashuwaymiyah stock.

Such ""contemporary ancestors"" can be used to demonstrate the effects of selection by comparing phenotypic and genetic divergence between the derived population and their extant ancestors. However, evolution and demography in these ""contemporary ancestors"" can complicate inferences about the source (standing genetic variation, de novo mutation) and pace of adaptive divergence. Marine threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) have colonized freshwater environments along the Pacific coast of North America, but have also persisted in the marine environment. To what extent are marine stickleback good proxies of the ancestral condition? Results: We sequenced &gt; 5800 variant loci in over 250 marine stickleback from eight locations extending from Alaska to California, and phenotyped them for platedness and body shape. Pairwise FST varied from 0.02 to 0.18. Stickleback were divided into five genetic clusters, with a single cluster comprising stickleback from Washington to Alaska. Plate number, Eda, body shape, and candidate loci showed evidence of being under selection in the marine environment. Comparisons to a freshwater population demonstrated that candidate loci for freshwater adaptation varied depending on the choice of marine populations. Conclusions: Marine stickleback are structured into phenotypically and genetically distinct populations that have been evolving as freshwater stickleback evolved. This variation complicates their usefulness as proxies of the ancestors of freshwater populations.

Several of these candidate regions had previously been identified in other studies, demonstrating that the same loci could be adaptively important in Atlantic salmon at subdrainage, regional and continental scales. Notably, we identified signals consistent with local selection around genes associated with variation in sexual maturation, energy homeostasis and immune defence. These included the large-effect ageat- maturity gene vgll3, the known obesity gene mc4r, and major histocompatibility complex II. Most strikingly, we confirmed a genomic region on Ssa09 that was extremely differentiated among subpopulations and that is also a candidate for local selection over the global range of Atlantic salmon. This region colocalized with a haplotype strongly associated with spawning ecotype in sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), with circumstantial evidence that the same gene (six6) may be the selective target in both cases. The phenotypic effect of this region in Atlantic salmon remains cryptic, although allelic variation is related to upstream catchment area and covaries with timing of the return spawning migration. Our results further inform management of Atlantic salmon and open multiple avenues for future research. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2018,"atlantic salmon; ecotype; local selection; microgeographic adaptation; sockeye salmon","Article","SCOPUS","no","NA","NA"
"Complex signatures of genomic variation of two non-model marine species in a homogeneous environment","10.1186/s12864-018-4721-y","Nielsen E.S., Henriques R., Toonen R.J., Knapp I.S.S., Guo B., von der Heyden S.","Background: Genomic tools are increasingly being used on non-model organisms to provide insights into population structure and variability, including signals of selection. However, most studies are carried out in regions with distinct environmental gradients or across large geographical areas, in which local adaptation is expected to occur. Therefore, the focus of this study is to characterize genomic variation and selective signals over short geographic areas within a largely homogeneous region. To assess adaptive signals between microhabitats within the rocky shore, we compared genomic variation between the Cape urchin (Parechinus angulosus), which is a low to mid-shore species, and the Granular limpet (Scutellastra granularis), a high shore specialist. Results: Using pooled restriction site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing, we described patterns of genomic variation and identified outlier loci in both species. We found relatively low numbers of outlier SNPs within each species, and identified outlier genes associated with different selective pressures than those previously identified in studies conducted over larger environmental gradients. The number of population-specific outlier loci differed between species, likely owing to differential selective pressures within the intertidal environment. Interestingly, the outlier loci were highly differentiated within the two northernmost populations for both species, suggesting that unique evolutionary forces are acting on marine invertebrates within this region. Conclusions: Our study provides a background for comparative genomic studies focused on non-model species, as well as a baseline for the adaptive potential of marine invertebrates along the South African west coast. We also discuss the caveats associated with Pool-seq and potential biases of sequencing coverage on downstream genomic metrics. The findings provide evidence of species-specific selective pressures within a homogeneous environment, and suggest that selective forces acting on small scales are just as crucial to acknowledge as those acting on larger scales. As a whole, our findings imply that future population genomic studies should expand from focusing on model organisms and/or studying heterogeneous regions to better understand the evolutionary processes shaping current and future biodiversity patterns, particularly when used in a comparative phylogeographic context. © 2018 The Author(s).",2018,"comparative phylogeography; genomics; local adaptation; population differentiation; rad-seq; snp","Article","SCOPUS","no","NA","NA"

We used 7163 SNPs derived from restriction site-associated DNA sequencing genotyped in 245 individuals of the economically important sea scallop, Placopecten magellanicus, to evaluate the correlations between oceanographic variation and a previously identified latitudinal genomic cline. Sea scallops span a broad latitudinal area (&gt;10 degrees), and we hypothesized that climatic variation significantly drives clinal trends in allele frequency. Using a large environmental dataset, including temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a, and nutrient concentrations, we identified a suite of SNPs (285–621, depending on analysis and environmental dataset) potentially under selection through correlations with environmental variation. Principal components analysis of different outlier SNPs and environmental datasets revealed similar northern and southern clusters, with significant associations between the first axes of each (R2 adj =.66–.79). Multivariate redundancy analysis of outlier SNPs and the environmental principal components indicated that environmental factors explained more than 32% of the variance. Similarly, multiple linear regressions and random-forest analysis identified winter average and minimum ocean temperatures as significant parameters in the link between genetic and environmental variation. This work indicates that oceanographic variation is associated with the observed genomic cline in this species and that seasonal periods of extreme cold may restrict gene flow along a latitudinal gradient in this marine benthic bivalve.

Genotyping with mapped transcriptome-derived markers and advanced seascape statistical analyses are proven tools to uncover the genomic basis of biologically relevant traits under environmental selection. Using a panel of 426 gene-linked single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we scanned 17 samples (n = 539) of sole (Solea solea L.) from the Northeast Atlantic Ocean and applied a node-based seascape analysis. Neutral loci confirmed a clear distinction between the North Sea-Baltic Sea transition zone and the other Eastern Atlantic samples. At a more subtle level, the latter unit split in an English Channel and North Sea group, and a Bay of Biscay and Atlantic Iberian coast group. A fourth group, the Irish and Celtic Sea, was identified with 19 outlier loci. A pattern of isolation by distance (IBD) characterized the latitudinal distribution. Seascape analyses identified winter seawater temperature, food availability and coastal currents to explain a significant component of geographically distributed genetic variation, suggesting that these factors act as drivers of local adaptation. The evidence for local adaptation is in line with the current understanding on the impact of two key ecological factors, the life-history trait winter mortality and the behaviour of inshore/offshore spawning. We conclude that the subtle differentiation between two metapopulations (North Sea and Bay of Biscay) mirrors local adaptation.

On the other hand, many physical barriers distribute along the continental marginal seas and may prevent dispersals and increase population divergence. These complexities along the continental margin generate serious challenges to population genetic studies of marine species. Chinese sea bass Lateolabrax maculatus distributes broad latitudinal gradient spanning from the tropical to the mid-temperate zones in the continental margin seas of the Northwest Pacific Ocean. Using the double digest restriction-site-associated DNA tag sequencing (ddRAD) approach, we genotyped 10,297 SNPs for 219 Chinese seabass individuals of 12 populations along the Chinese coast in the Northwest Pacific region. Genetic divergence among these populations was evaluated, and population structure was established. The results suggested that geographically distant populations in the Bohai Gulf and the Beibu Gulf retain significant genetic divergence, which are connected by a series of intermediate populations in between. The results also suggested that Leizhou Peninsula, Hainan Island, and Shandong Peninsula are major physical barriers and substantially block gene flow and genetic admixture of L. maculatus. We also investigated the potential genetic basis of local adaptation correlating with population differentiation of L. maculatus. The sea surface temperature is a significantly differentiated environmental factor for the distribution of L. maculatus. The correlation of water temperature and genetic variations in extensively distributed populations was investigated with Bayesian-based approaches. The candidate genes underlying the local selection in geographically divergent populations were identified and annotated, providing clues to understand the potential mechanisms of adaptive evolution.

"Founder effects drive the genetic structure of passively dispersed aquatic invertebrates","10.7717/peerj.6094","Montero-Pau J., Gómez A., Serra M.","Populations of passively dispersed organisms in continental aquatic habitats typically show high levels of neutral genetic differentiation despite their high dispersal capabilities. Several evolutionary factors, including founder events, local adaptation, and life cycle features such as high population growth rates and the presence of propagule banks, have been proposed to be responsible for this paradox. Here, we have modeled the colonization process to assess the impact of migration rate, population growth rate, population size, local adaptation and life-cycle features on the population genetic structure in these organisms. Our simulations show that the strongest effect on population structure are persistent founder effects, resulting from the interaction of a few population founders, high population growth rates, large population sizes and the presence of diapausing egg banks. In contrast, the role of local adaptation, genetic hitchhiking and migration is limited to small populations in these organisms.

"Genomic analysis of a cardinalfish with larval homing potential reveals genetic admixture in the Okinawa Islands","10.1111/mec.14169","Gould A.L., Dunlap P.V.","Discrepancies between potential and observed dispersal distances of reef fish indicate the need for a better understanding of the influence of larval behaviour on recruitment and dispersal. Population genetic studies can provide insight on the degree to which populations are connected, and the development of restriction site-associated sequencing (RAD-Seq) methods has made such studies of nonmodel organisms more accessible. We applied double-digest RAD-Seq methods to test for population differentiation in the coral reef-dwelling cardinalfish, Siphamia tubifer, which based on behavioural studies, have the potential to use navigational cues to return to natal reefs. Analysis of 11,836 SNPs from fish collected at coral reefs in Okinawa, Japan, from eleven locations over 3 years reveals little genetic differentiation between groups of S. tubifer at spatial scales from 2 to 140 km and between years at one location: pairwise FST values were between 0.0116 and 0.0214. These results suggest that the Kuroshio Current largely influences larval dispersal in the region, and in contrast to expectations based on studies of other cardinalfishes, there is no evidence of population structure for S. tubifer at the spatial scales examined. However, analyses of outlier loci putatively under selection reveal patterns of temporal differentiation that indicate high population turnover and variable larval supply from divergent source populations between years. These findings highlight the need for more studies of fishes across various geographic regions that also examine temporal patterns of genetic differentiation to better understand the potential connections between early life-history traits and connectivity of reef fish populations. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",2017,"bioluminescent; population genetics; rad-seq; siphamia tubifer; snps","Article","SCOPUS","no","NA","NA"
"Highly localized divergence within supergenes in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) within the Gulf of Maine","10.1186/s12864-017-3660-3","Barney B.T., Munkholm C., Walt D.R., Palumbi S.R.","Background: Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), is known to vary genetically across the North Atlantic, Greenland, and Newfoundland. This genetic variation occurs both spatially and temporally through decades of heavy fishing, and is concentrated in three linkage disequilibrium blocks, previously defined by pedigreed linkage mapping analysis. Variation within these genomic regions is correlated with both seawater temperature and behavioral ecotype. The full extent and nature of these linkage groups is important information for interpreting cod genetic structure as a tool for future fisheries management. Results: We conducted whole genome sequencing for 31 individual cod from three sub-populations in the Gulf of Maine. Across the genome, we found 3,390,654 intermediate to high frequency Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). We show that pairwise linkage analysis among these SNPs is a powerful tool to detect linkage disequilibrium clusters by recovering the three previously detected linkage groups and identifying the 1031 genes contained therein. Across these genes, we found significant population differentiation among spawning groups in the Gulf of Maine and between Georges Bank and Gulf of Maine. Coordinated divergence among these genes and their differentiation at both short and long spatial scales suggests that they are acting as linked supergenes in local adaptation of cod populations. Conclusions: Differentiation between SNPs in linkage disequilibrium blocks is the major signal of genetic differentiation between all groups tested within the Gulf of Maine. Our data provide a map of genes contained in these blocks, allowing an enhanced search for neutral genetic structure for demographic inference and fisheries modeling. Patterns of selection and the history of populations may be possible to identify in cod using this description of linkage disequilibrium blocks and future data sets to robustly separate neutral and selected genetic markers. © 2017 The Author(s).",2017,"atlantic cod; gadus morhua; genomic divergence; gulf of maine; linkage disequilibrium; linkage map; supergene","Article","SCOPUS","no","NA","NA"

Under the Core-Periphery Hypothesis (CPH), genetic diversity is expected to be highest at the centre of a species' distribution, progressively decreasing with increased differentiation towards outer range limits, as populations become increasingly isolated, fragmented and locally adapted. The unique life history characteristics of many marine invertebrates such as high dispersal rates, stochastic survival and variable recruitment are also likely to influence how populations are organised. To examine the microevolutionary forces influencing population structure, connectivity and adaptive variation in a highly-dispersive bivalve, populations of the black-lip pearl oyster Pinctada margaritifera were examined across its ~18,000 km Indo-Pacific distribution. Results: Analyses utilising 9,624 genome-wide SNPs and 580 oysters, discovered differing patterns of significant and substantial broad-scale genetic structure between the Indian and Pacific Ocean basins. Indian Ocean populations were markedly divergent (F st = 0.2534-0.4177, p &lt; 0.001), compared to Pacific Ocean oysters, where basin-wide gene flow was much higher (F st = 0.0007-0.1090, p &lt; 0.001). Partitioning of genetic diversity (hierarchical AMOVA) attributed 18.1% of variance between ocean basins, whereas greater proportions were resolved within samples and populations (45.8% and 35.7% respectively). Visualisation of population structure at selectively neutral loci resolved three and five discrete genetic clusters for the Indian and Pacific Oceans respectively. Evaluation of genetic structure at adaptive loci for Pacific populations (89 SNPs under directional selection; F st = 0.1012-0.4371, FDR = 0.05), revealed five clusters identical to those detected at neutral SNPs, suggesting environmental heterogeneity within the Pacific. Patterns of structure and connectivity were supported by Mantel tests of isolation by distance (IBD) and independent hydrodynamic particle dispersal simulations. Conclusions: It is evident that genetic structure and connectivity across the natural range of P. margaritifera is highly complex, and produced by the interaction of ocean currents, IBD and seascape features at a broad scale, together with habitat geomorphology and local adaptation at regional levels. Overall population organisation is far more elaborate than generalised CPH predictions, however valuable insights for regional fishery management, and a greater understanding of range-wide genetic structure in a highly-dispersive marine invertebrate have been gained. © 2017 The Author(s).",2017,"aquaculture; core-periphery hypothesis; hydrodynamic dispersal; population genomics; snp; species distribution","Article","SCOPUS","no","NA","NA"

Species distributed across such biogeographic discontinuities are thus more prone to develop genetic clines and adaptations to environmental variation. The northwest coast of France encompasses a biogeographic boundary between cold- and warmerate marine ecosystems. Distinct hydrographic features characterize northern and southern shores, promoting physical oceanographic breaks that can affect dispersal and connectivity between populations. Furthermore, mosaics of contrasting conditions may affect local patterns of species assemblages and potential adaptive pressures. Along this stretch of coast, the intertidal habitat is largely dominated by brown algae of the genus Fucus, key structuring species common along North Atlantic shorelines. Fucus spiralis, F. guiryi and F. vesiculosus are sister species with different mating systems. They have extensive sympatric geographical distributions and distinct but overlapping vertical distributions in the intertidal zone. We examined genetic structure and diversity across this major environmental transition zone using neutral microsatellite markers to investigate patterns of differentiation between populations of each species inhabiting the two different biogeographic regions. We found contrasting results between the dioecious species (F. vesiculosus) and the two selfing hermaphroditic lineages (F. spiralis and F. guiryi). Genetic differentiation of northern and southern populations of F. vesiculosus followed the expectation from a hypothetical oceanographic discontinuity across this biogeographical transition zone, but this was not the case for the two hermaphroditic species. The former had higher genetic diversity and structure along the distribution range investigated whereas selfing hermaphrodites had less variability and were not geographically structured. Our results suggest that genetic patterns are correlated with this biogeographical transition zone but this effect is dependent on mating system, a determining factor affecting population structure. Additionally, other factors such as intertidal elevation may also play a role in observed difference in genetic structuring. © EDP Sciences 2017.",2017,"biogeographic transition zones; fucus; genetic diversity; mating system; microsatellites","Article","SCOPUS","no","NA","NA"
"Population genomic evidence for adaptive differentiation in the Baltic Sea herring","10.1111/mec.13657","Guo B., Li Z., Merilä J.","Detecting and estimating the degree of genetic differentiation among populations of highly mobile marine fish having pelagic larval stages is challenging because their effective population sizes can be large, and thus, little genetic drift and differentiation is expected in neutral genomic sites. However, genomic sites subject to directional selection stemming from variation in local environmental conditions can still show substantial genetic differentiation, yet these signatures can be hard to detect with low-throughput approaches. Using a pooled RAD-seq approach, we investigated genomewide patterns of genetic variability and differentiation within and among 20 populations of Atlantic herring in the Baltic Sea (and adjacent Atlantic sites), where previous low-throughput studies and/or studies based on few populations have found limited evidence for genetic differentiation. Stringent quality control was applied in the filtering of 1 791 254 SNPs, resulting in a final data set of 68 182 polymorphic loci. Clear differentiation was identified between Atlantic and Baltic populations in many genomic sites, while differentiation within the Baltic Sea area was weaker and geographically less structured. However, outlier analyses - whether including all populations or only those within the Baltic Sea - uncovered hundreds of directionally selected loci in which variability was associated with either salinity, temperature or both. Hence, our results support the view that although the degree of genetic differentiation among Baltic Sea herring populations is low, there are many genomic regions showing elevated divergence, apparently as a response to temperature- and salinity-related natural selection. As such, the results add to the increasing evidence of local adaptation in highly mobile marine organisms, and those in the young Baltic Sea in particular. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2016,"clupea harengus; local adaptation; rad-seq; salinity; snp; temperature","Article","SCOPUS","no","NA","NA"

Here, we identified 27 556 single nucleotide polymorphisms for the small yellow croaker (Larimichthys polyactis) using restriction-site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing of 24 individuals from two populations. Significant sources of genetic variation were identified, with an average nucleotide diversity (p) of 0.00105 ± 0.000425 across individuals, and long-term effective population size was thus estimated to range between 26 172 and 261 716.

Studies of highly mobile marine fish populations provide an opportunity to investigate this kind of heterogeneous genomic differentiation, but most studies to this effect have focused on a relatively low number of genetic markers and/or few populations. Hence, the patterns and extent of genomic divergence in high-gene-flow marine fish populations remain poorly understood. Results: We here investigated genome-wide patterns of genetic variability and differentiation in ten marine populations of three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) distributed across a steep salinity and temperature gradient in the Baltic Sea, by utilizing >30,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms obtained with a pooled RAD-seq approach. We found that genetic diversity and differentiation varied widely across the genome, and identified numerous fairly narrow genomic regions exhibiting signatures of both divergent and balancing selection. Evidence was uncovered for substantial genetic differentiation associated with both salinity and temperature gradients, and many candidate genes associated with local adaptation in the Baltic Sea were identified. Conclusions: The patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation, as well as candidate genes associated with adaptation, in Baltic Sea sticklebacks were similar to those observed in earlier comparisons between marine and freshwater populations, suggesting that similar processes may be driving adaptation to brackish and freshwater environments.

Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) are a broadly distributed Pacific salmon species, occupying a diversity of habitats throughout the northeastern Pacific with pronounced variation in environmental and climate features but little is understood regarding local adaptation in this species. We used a multivariate method, redundancy analysis (RDA), to identify polygenic correlations between 19 703 SNP loci and a suite of environmental variables in 46 collections of Chinook salmon (1956 total individuals) distributed throughout much of its North American range. Models in RDA were conducted on both rangewide and regional scales by hierarchical partitioning of the populations into three distinct genetic lineages. Our results indicate that between 5.8 and 21.8% of genomic variation can be accounted for by environmental features, and 566 putatively adaptive loci were identified as targets of environmental adaptation. The most influential drivers of adaptive divergence included precipitation in the driest quarter of the year (Rangewide and North Coastal Lineage, anova P = 0.002 and 0.01, respectively), precipitation in the wettest quarter of the year (Interior Columbia River Stream-Type Lineage, anova P = 0.03), variation in mean diurnal range in temperature (South Coastal Lineage, anova P = 0.005), and migration distance (Rangewide, anova P = 0.001).

We investigated the genomic signatures of local adaptation in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.) along a natural salinity gradient, ranging from 35% in the North Sea to 7% within the Baltic Sea. By utilizing a 12K SNP chip, we simultaneously assessed neutral and adaptive genetic divergence across the Atlantic cod genome. Combining outlier analyses with a landscape genomic approach, we identified a set of directionally selected loci that are strongly correlated with habitat differences in salinity, oxygen, and temperature. Our results show that discrete regions within the Atlantic cod genome are subject to directional selection and associated with adaptation to the local environmental conditions in the Baltic- and the North Sea, indicating divergence hitchhiking and the presence of genomic islands of divergence. We report a suite of outlier single nucleotide polymorphisms within or closely located to genes associated with osmoregulation, as well as genes known to play important roles in the hydration and development of oocytes. These genes are likely to have key functions within a general osmoregulatory framework and are important for the survival of eggs and larvae, contributing to the buildup of reproductive isolation between the low-salinity adapted Baltic cod and the adjacent cod populations. Hence, our data suggest that adaptive responses to the environmental conditions in the Baltic Sea may contribute to a strong and effective reproductive barrier, and that Baltic cod can be viewed as an example of ongoing speciation. © The Author(s) 2015.",2015,"atlantic cod; baltic sea; ecological divergence; genomic adaptation; population genomics; snps; speciation","Article","SCOPUS","no","NA","NA"
"Establishing the evolutionary compatibility of potential sources of colonizers for overfished stocks: A population genomics approach","10.1111/mec.13046","Gonçalves Da Silva A., Appleyard S.A., Upston J.","Identifying fish stock structure is fundamental to pinpoint stocks that might contribute colonizers to overfished stocks. However, a stock's potential to contribute to rebuilding hinges on demographic connectivity, a challenging parameter to measure. With genomics as a new tool, fisheries managers can detect signatures of natural selection and thus identify fishing areas likely to contribute evolutionarily compatible colonizers to an overfished area (i.e. colonizers that are not at a fitness disadvantage in the overfished area and able to reproduce at optimal rates). Identifying evolutionarily compatible stocks would help narrow the focus on establishing demographic connectivity where it matters. Here, we genotype 4723 SNPs in 616 orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) across five fishing areas off the Tasmanian coast in Australia. We ask whether these areas form a single genetic unit, and test for signatures of local adaptation. Results from amova, structure, discriminant analysis of principal components, bayesass and isolation by distance suggest that sampled locations are subjected to geneflow amounts that are above what is needed to establish 'drift connectivity'. However, it remains unclear whether there is a single panmictic population or several highly connected populations. Most importantly, we did not find any evidence of local adaptation, suggesting that the examined orange roughy stocks are evolutionarily compatible.

"Conservation genomics of anadromous Atlantic salmon across its North American range: Outlier loci identify the same patterns of population structure as neutral loci","10.1111/mec.12972","Moore J.-S., Bourret V., Dionne M., Bradbury I., O'Reilly P., Kent M., Chaput G., Bernatchez L.","Anadromous Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is a species of major conservation and management concern in North America, where population abundance has been declining over the past 30 years. Effective conservation actions require the delineation of conservation units to appropriately reflect the spatial scale of intraspecific variation and local adaptation. Towards this goal, we used the most comprehensive genetic and genomic database for Atlantic salmon to date, covering the entire North American range of the species. The database included microsatellite data from 9142 individuals from 149 sampling locations and data from a medium-density SNP array providing genotypes for >3000 SNPs for 50 sampling locations. We used neutral and putatively selected loci to integrate adaptive information in the definition of conservation units. Bayesian clustering with the microsatellite data set and with neutral SNPs identified regional groupings largely consistent with previously published regional assessments. The use of outlier SNPs did not result in major differences in the regional groupings, suggesting that neutral markers can reflect the geographic scale of local adaptation despite not being under selection. We also performed assignment tests to compare power obtained from microsatellites, neutral SNPs and outlier SNPs. Using SNP data substantially improved power compared to microsatellites, and an assignment success of 97% to the population of origin and of 100% to the region of origin was achieved when all SNP loci were used. Using outlier SNPs only resulted in minor improvements to assignment success to the population of origin but improved regional assignment. We discuss the implications of these new genetic resources for the conservation and management of Atlantic salmon in North America. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2014,"assignment tests; fishery; hierarchical population structure; local adaptation; microsatellites; single nucleotide polymorphisms; snp array","Article","SCOPUS","no","NA","NA"

Baltic cod exhibits various adaptations to brackish water conditions, yet the inflow of salty North Sea water near the bottom remains an influence on the spawning success of the Baltic cod. The eastern Baltic population has been very weakly studied in comparison with the western population.The aim of this study is to demonstrate for the first time genetic differentiation by the use of a large number of SNPs between eastern and western Baltic populations existing in differentiated salinity conditions. Two cod samples were collected from the Bay of Gdansk, Poland and one from the Kiel Bight, Germany. Samples were genotyped using a cod derived SNP-array (Illumina) with 10 913 SNPs. A selection of diagnostic SNPs was performed. A set of 7944 validated SNPs were analysed to assess the differentiation of three samples of cod. Results indicated a clear distinctness of the Kiel Bight from the populations of the eastern Baltic. FST comparison between both eastern samples was non-significant. Clustering analysis, principal coordinates analysis and assignment test clearly indicated that the eastern samples should be considered as one subpopulation, well differentiated from the western subpopulation.

Using a large SNP data set from 259 RAD-sequenced European eel individuals (glass eels) from eight locations between 34 and 64oN, we examined the patterns of genome-wide genetic diversity across locations. We tested for local selection by searching for increased population differentiation using FST-based outlier tests and by testing for significant associations between allele frequencies and environmental variables. The overall low genetic differentiation found (FST = 0.0007) indicates that most of the genome is homogenized by gene flow, providing further evidence for genomic panmixia in the European eel. The lack of genetic substructuring was consistent at both nuclear and mitochondrial SNPs. Using an extensive number of diagnostic SNPs, results showed a low occurrence of hybrids between European and American eel, mainly limited to Iceland (5.9%), although individuals with signatures of introgression several generations back in time were found in mainland Europe. Despite panmixia, a small set of SNPs showed high genetic differentiation consistent with single-generation signatures of spatially varying selection acting on glass eels. After screening 50 354 SNPs, a total of 754 potentially locally selected SNPs were identified. Candidate genes for local selection constituted a wide array of functions, including calcium signalling, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and circadian rhythm. Remarkably, one of the candidate genes identified is PERIOD, possibly related to differences in local photoperiod associated with the &gt;30 difference in latitude between locations. Genes under selection were spread across the genome, and there were no large regions of increased differentiation as expected when selection occurs within just a single generation due to panmixia. This supports the conclusion that most of the genome is homogenized by gene flow that removes any effects of diversifying selection from each new generation. © 2014 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.",2014,"anguilla; local adaptation; panmixia; spatially varying selection","Article","SCOPUS","no","NA","NA"

Targeted gene analyses and more recently genome-wide studies have challenged such view, suggesting that adaptive divergence might occur even when neutral markers provide genetic homogeneity across populations. Here, 381 SNPs located in transcribed regions were used to assess large- and fine-scale population structure in the European hake (Merluccius merluccius), a widely distributed demersal species of high priority for the European fishery. Analysis of 850 individuals from 19 locations across the entire distribution range showed evidence for several outlier loci, with significantly higher resolving power. While 299 putatively neutral SNPs confirmed the genetic break between basins (FCT = 0.016) and weak differentiation within basins, outlier loci revealed a dramatic divergence between Atlantic and Mediterranean populations (FCT range 0.275-0.705) and fine-scale significant population structure. Outlier loci separated North Sea and Northern Portugal populations from all other Atlantic samples and revealed a strong differentiation among Western, Central and Eastern Mediterranean geographical samples. Significant correlation of allele frequencies at outlier loci with seawater surface temperature and salinity supported the hypothesis that populations might be adapted to local conditions. Such evidence highlights the importance of integrating information from neutral and adaptive evolutionary patterns towards a better assessment of genetic diversity.

To uncover the basis of a complex trait like osmoregulation, genome-level analyses are sensible. We combine population genomic scans with genome expression profiling to discover candidate genes and pathways associated with divergence between osmotic environments. We compared transcriptome sequence divergence between multiple freshwater and saltwater populations of the rainwater killifish, Lucania parva. We also compared sequence divergence between L. parva and its sister species, Lucania goodei, a freshwater specialist. We found highly differentiated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between freshwater and saltwater L. parva populations in cell junction and ion transport genes, including V-type H+ ATPase. Between species, we found divergence in reproduction and osmotic stress genes. Genes that were differentially expressed between species during osmotic acclimation included genes involved in ion transport and cell volume regulation. Gene sets that were divergent in coding sequence and divergent in expression did not overlap, although they did converge in function. Like many studies using genomic scans, our approach may miss some loci that contribute to adaptation but have complicated patterns of allelic variation.

"High degree of cryptic population differentiation in the Baltic Sea herring Clupea harengus","10.1111/mec.12174","Corander J., Majander K.K., Cheng L., Merilä J.","Marine fish species are characterized by a low degree of population differentiation at putatively neutral marker genes. This has been traditionally attributed to ecological homogeneity and a lack of obvious dispersal barriers in marine habitats, as well as to the large (effective) population sizes of most marine fish species. The herring (Clupea harengus) is a case in point - the levels of population differentiation at neutral markers, even across vast geographic areas, are typically very low (FST ˜ 0.005). We used a RAD-sequencing approach to identify 5985 novel single-nucleotide polymorphism markers (SNPs) in herring and estimated genome-wide levels of divergence using pooled DNA samples between two Baltic Sea populations separated by 387 km. We found a total of 4756 divergent SNPs (79% of all SNPs) between the populations, of which 117 showed evidence of substantial divergence, corresponding to F ST = 0.128 (0.125, 0.131) after accounting for possible biases due to minor alleles and uneven DNA amplification over the pooled samples. This estimate - based on screening many genomic polymorphisms - suggests the existence of hitherto unrecognized levels of genetic differentiation in this commercially important species, challenging the view of genetic homogeneity in marine fish species, and in that of the Baltic Sea herring in particular. © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.",2013,"fst; fish; population genomics; rad-seq; single-nucleotide polymorphism marker","Article","SCOPUS","no","NA","NA"

Yet unexplained findings of within-region population genetic heterogeneity coupled with the morphological and behavioural diversity described for the species suggest that adaptive genetic variation underlying fitness traits may be responsible. We employed restriction site-associated DNA sequencing to genotype 4439 quality filtered single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci for 518 individuals collected across a broad geographical area including British Columbia, Washington, Oregon and California. A subset of putatively neutral markers (N = 4068) identified a significant amount of variation among three broad populations: northern British Columbia, Columbia River/southern coast and 'dwarf' adults (FCT = 0.02, P « 0.001). Additionally, 162 SNPs were identified as adaptive through outlier tests, and inclusion of these markers revealed a signal of adaptive variation related to geography and life history. The majority of the 162 adaptive SNPs were not independent and formed four groups of linked loci. Analyses with matsam software found that 42 of these outlier SNPs were significantly associated with geography, run timing and dwarf life history, and 27 of these 42 SNPs aligned with known genes or highly conserved genomic regions using the genome browser available for sea lamprey.

Documenting patterns of genetic adaptation to these variables in locations that currently experience geographic variation in them is an important tool in understanding the potential for natural selection to allow populations to adapt as climate change proceeds. We sequenced the mantle transcriptome of 39 red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) individuals from three regions (Monterey Bay, Sonoma, north of Cape Mendocino) distinct in temperature, aragonite saturation, exposure to hypoxia and disease pressure along the California coast. Among 1.17 × 106 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in this study (1.37% of the transcriptome), 21 579 could be genotyped for all individuals. A principal components analysis concluded that the vast majority of SNPs show no population structure from Monterey, California to the Oregon border, in corroboration with several previous studies. In contrast, an F ST outlier analysis indicated 691 SNPs as exhibiting significantly higher than expected differentiation (experiment-wide P &lt; 0.05). From these, it was possible to identify 163 genes through BLAST annotation, 34 of which contained more than one outlier SNP. A large number of these genes are involved in biomineralization, energy metabolism, heat-, disease- or hypoxia-tolerance.

In marine populations, generally characterised by large population sizes and high gene flow, the simultaneous use of multiple descriptors (i.e. genetic, morphological, life-history, etc.) can be particularly helpful in unravelling the often subtle and complex spatial patterns observed. The gastropod Buccinum undatum (common whelk) lacks a planktonic larval stage, which could promote isolation of local populations and lead to phenotypic divergence through genetic drift or local adaptation. Despite the commercial significance of this species, the relative importance of these 2 forces remains unknown. Here, we used microsatellites, geometric morphometrics and shell thickness measurements to investigate the evolutionary dynamics generating spatial variation in 10 whelk populations in coastal waters around Ireland. Genetic diversity was generally high and genetic structure moderate but significant (overall F ST = 0.019), in accordance with an isolation-by-distance pattern. Phenotypic divergence, as measured by PST, was uncorrelated with, and much more pronounced than, neutral divergence (F ST), indicating that environmental variation rather than population isolation drives phenotypic differentiation. For some traits, at least, diversifying selection is likely to be involved unless additive genetic components of phenotypic variation among populations are very low. Our results document a lack of correspondence between neutral and adaptive divergence, and highlight the need to couple connectivity estimates with the assessment of ecologically relevant traits in fisheries management and conservation. © 2012 Inter-Research.",2012,"adaptation; buccinum undatum; gastropoda; genetic drift; geometric morphometrics; microsatellites; pst","Article","SCOPUS","no","NA","NA"

However, very few studies have combined spatial and temporal sampling to investigate adaptive genetic structuring at local and microgeographical scales, i.e. scales at which neutral genetic markers have typically revealed very limited levels of population structure. In the present study we analyzed 92 gene-associated single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in Atlantic cod Gadus morhua from several sampling sites within the North Sea and adjacent areas. To test for temporal stability, we included long- and short-term (i.e. from 24 to 38 and from 8 to 11 yr, respectively) temporally replicated samples from a subset of populations. As expected, we found very low levels of neutral genetic population structure (FST = 0.003). Three specific loci, however, showed highly elevated levels of genetic differentiation. Interestingly, these loci were identical to loci previously found to display signals of adaptive evolution on larger spatial scales. Analysis of historical samples revealed long-term temporally stable patterns of both neutral and adaptive divergence between some populations, indicating long-term temporal adaptive stability driven by strong local selection. In an environmentally dynamic area, on the other hand, patterns of genetic structuring were more variable. Overall, our results not only suggest separation of populations under both evolutionary and ecological paradigms, but also illustrate the usefulness of the spatio-temporal approach for making inferences about the dynamics and geographical distribution of adaptive genetic variation in natural populations. © 2011 Inter-Research.",2011,"adaptive genetic variation; atlantic cod; local selection; single nucleotide polymorphism; snps","Article","SCOPUS","no","NA","NA"

This designation is decades old and warrants re-evaluation in light of concerns that fisheries management units may not reflect biologically meaningful population units. In this study, we used 10 microsatellite loci, the PanI locus, and 5 single nucleotide polymorphism markers to characterize the population genetic structure of cod in US waters. We found significant differentiation among temporally and spatially divergent populations of cod (global FST = 0.0044), primarily stemming from 2 potentially non-neutral loci, and evidence for a population structure that strongly contradicts the current 2-stock management model. This genetic structure was stable over a 5 yr period. Our results indicate that cod in US waters are broadly structured into 3 groups: (1) a northern spring-spawning coastal complex in the Gulf of Maine (GOM), (2) a southern complex consisting of winter-spawning inshore GOM, offshore GOM and sites south of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and (3) a Georges Bank population. The strongest differentiation occurs between populations in the northern and southern complex (mean FST = 0.0085), some of which spawn in the same bays in different seasons. By means of mixture analysis, young-of-the-year fish sampled on juvenile nurseries were assigned to the spawning complex of their origin. Our findings contribute to a growing body of knowledge that Atlantic cod and other marine fish populations are structured on a finer scale than previously thought and that this structure supports biocomplexity and locally adapted populations. As such, it may be warranted to re-evaluate current management units and tailor management plans toward this finer scale.

Overall, 84 mtDNA haplotypes were defined, and were split into three clades by the phylogenetic trees. The divergences of COI gene sequence among the three clades ranged from 11.4 to 22.5%, indicating the occurrence of three cryptic species (cryptic species 1, cryptic species 2, and cryptic species 3). Within cryptic species 3, a remarkable degree of differentiation (Fst = 0.0947) might be attributable to habitat fragmentation, restricted gene flow, and founder effect, most probably together with local adaptation. The more shared haplotypes were observed, and a non-significant correlation existed between geographic and genetic distance, suggesting that some ancestral haplotypes might be involved in a past range expansion, and as founders give a similar distribution pattern among geographic populations. The networks were also in agreement with the pattern of genetic differentiation in B. calyciflorus species complex revealed by molecular phylogeny. The nested clade analysis suggested a slight geographic structure in the network I, network II, and the highest nesting clade levels within the network III. Under the possible effect of the Younger Dryas Event, the three cryptic species might have survived in multiple relict refugia throughout the south of China. The co-occurrence of cryptic species 2 and 3 might be found in Guangzhou and Hainan due to the possible interference of the barrier and contiguous range expansion. After the Younger Dryas Event, cryptic species 3 with high colonization ability might have arrived and colonized whole habitats at first, and reduce effective gene flow among cryptic species, thus effectively increasing persistence of founder events. Cryptic species 2 might, respectively, have expanded their ranges into Wuhu and Nanjing regions only because of the probable barrier of the Yangtze River, its weak colonization abilities and the 'priority effects' of cryptic species 3.

Allele frequencies at temperature-associated loci were significantly correlated, spanned three linkage groups and several were successfully annotated supporting the involvement of multiple independent genes.

A subsequent invasion to Nova Scotia from a northern European source allowed further range expansion, providing a unique opportunity to study the invasion genomics of a species with multiple invasions. Here, we use restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing-derived SNPs to explore fine-scale genomewide differentiation between these two invasions. We identified 9137 loci from green crab sampled from 11 locations along eastern North America and compared spatial variation to mitochondrial COI sequence variation used previously to characterize these invasions. Overall spatial divergence among invasions was high (pairwise FST ~0.001 to 0.15) and spread across many loci, with a mean FST ~0.052 and 52% of loci examined characterized by FST values >0.05. The majority of the most divergent loci (i.e., outliers, ~1.2%) displayed latitudinal clines in allele frequency highlighting extensive genomic divergence among the invasions. Discriminant analysis of principal components (both neutral and outlier loci) clearly resolved the two invasions spatially and was highly correlated with mitochondrial divergence.

Thus, the aim of this study was to characterize the spatial patterns of neutral genomic variation of green abalone along the BCP to test whether the genomic structure patterns support the current green abalone management areas. To test this hypothesis, a set of 2,170 putative neutral single nucleotide polymorphisms discovered by a double digest restriction-site associated DNA approach was used on 10 locations along the BCP. The results revealed a population structure with three putative groups: Guadalupe Island and northern and southern BCP locations. The contemporary gene flow might be explained by local oceanographic features, where it is bidirectional within the southern region but with a predominant southward flow from the northern region.

Unfortunately, this knowledge is unknown mainly for abalone species in the Northeast Pacific, where stocks have failed to recover. The pink abalone (Haliotis corrugata) is a fishing resource on the western coast of the Baja California Peninsula (BCP) and is currently catalogued as diminished with a recovery trending pattern. This research determined if the biological units matched the administrative and stock assessment units along the west coast of the BCP and the implications for fishery management. To test this hypothesis, a double digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing approach was used to generate 1 733 neutral and 6 putative outlier loci for population genomic analysis. Neutral markers detected a smooth partition in two regional groups, the southern (San Juanico, La Bocana, Bahía Asunción, Puerto Escondido, Punta Eugenia, and Natividad Island) and northern regions (Cedros Island, Faro San José, San Jerónimo Island, and Guadalupe Island). Putative outlier loci indicated evident differentiation of those groups. The population subdivision at 28° latitude with both marker types was related to a biogeographic boundary. Results did not support the current administrative zones of pink abalone fisheries and contrasted with genetic homogeneity reports in the region.",2021,"ddrad; haliotis corrugata; pink abalone; population genomics","Article","Other","no","NA","NA"
"Genetic connectivity of two marine gastropods in the Mediterranean Sea: seascape genetics reveals species-specific oceanographic drivers of gene flow","10.1111/mec.16080","Lopez-Marquez, V; Cushman, SA; Templado, J; Wan, HY; Bothwell, HM; Machordom, A","Oceanographic features such as currents, waves, temperature and salinity, together with life history traits, control patterns and rates of gene flow and contribute to shaping the population genetic structure of marine organisms. Seascape genetics is an emerging discipline that adopts a spatially explicit approach to examine biotic and abiotic factors that drive gene flow in marine environments. In this study, we examined factors that contribute to genetic differentiation in two coastal Mediterranean gastropods whose geographical ranges overlap but which inhabit different environments. The two species differ in several life history traits and in their dispersal capabilities. Genetic differentiation was relatively low for the trochid species Gibbula divaricata (F-ST =0.059), and high for the vermetid species Dendropoma lebeche (F-ST =0.410). Salinity emerged as the most important variable explaining the genetic structure of both species; sea surface temperature was also important for G. divaricata. For the more sessile D. lebeche, the coastline was predicted to provide important pathways for stepping-stone connectivity and gene flow. Our results provide a greater understanding of the factors influencing marine population connectivity, which may be useful to guide marine conservation and management in the Mediterranean.",2021,"dendropoma lebeche; genetic connectivity; gibbula divaricata; landscape genomics; marine conservation; multivariate optimization; population genetics; seascape genetics; unicor","Article","ISI","no",NA,NA

In marine systems this is challenging due to a paucity of information on habitat heterogeneity at local and regional scales and a dependency on sampling regimes that are typically limited to broad longitudinal and latitudinal environmental gradients. As a result, the spatial scales at which selection processes operate and the environmental factors that contribute to genetic adaptation in marine systems are likely to be unclear. In this study we explore patterns of adaptive genetic structuring in a commercially- harvested abalone species (Haliotis rubra) from southeastern Australia, using a panel of genome-wide SNP markers (5,239 SNPs), and a sampling regime informed by marine LiDAR bathymetric imagery and 20-year hindcasted oceanographic models. Despite a lack of overall genetic structure across the sampling distribution, significant genotype associations with heterogeneous habitat features were observed at local and regional spatial scales, including associations with wave energy, ocean current, sea surface temperature, and geology. These findings provide insights into the potential resilience of the species to changing marine climates and the role of migration and selection on recruitment processes, with implications for conservation and fisheries management. This study points to the spatial scales at which selection processes operate in marine systems and highlights the benefits of geospatially-informed sampling regimes for overcoming limitations associated with marine population genomic research.",2019,"abalone; environmental heterogeneity; fisheries management; genetic adaptation; hindcasted oceanographic models; lidar; marine conservation; population genomics","Article","ISI","no",NA,NA

Genotyping-by-sequencing approaches have enabled investigation of genomewide variation that may better distinguish populations that have evolved in different environments. We investigated neutral and adaptive genetic variation in Mytilus from six locations in southern Chile with 1240 SNPs obtained with RAD-seq. Differentiation among locations with 891 neutral SNPs was low (F-ST = 0.005). Higher differentiation was obtained with a panel of 58 putative outlier SNPs (F-ST = 0.114) indicating the potential for local adaptation. This panel identified clusters of genetically related individuals and demonstrated that much of the differentiation (similar to 92%) could be attributed to the three major regions and environments: extreme conditions in Patagonia, inner bay influenced by aquaculture (Reloncavi), and outer bay (Chiloe Island). Patagonia samples were most distinct, but additional analysis carried out excluding this collection also revealed adaptive divergence between inner and outer bay samples. The four locations within Reloncavi area were most similar with all panels of markers, likely due to similar environments, high gene flow by aquaculture practices, and low geographical distance.

These genomic islands of adaptive divergence can inform conservation efforts in exploited species, by refining the delineation of management units, and providing genomic tools for more precise and effective population monitoring and the successful assignment of individuals and products. We explored heterogeneity in genomic divergence and its impact on the resolution of spatial population structure in exploited populations of Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua, using genome wide expressed sequence derived single nucleotide polymorphisms in 466 individuals sampled across the range. Outlier tests identified elevated divergence at 5.2% of SNPs, consistent with directional selection in one-third of linkage groups. Genomic regions of elevated divergence ranged in size from a single position to several cM. Structuring at neutral loci was associated with geographic features, whereas outlier SNPs revealed genetic discontinuities in both the eastern and western Atlantic. This fine-scale geographic differentiation enhanced assignment to region of origin, and through the identification of adaptive diversity, fundamentally changes how these populations should be conserved. This work demonstrates the utility of genome scans for adaptive divergence in the delineation of stock structure, the traceability of individuals and products, and ultimately a role for population genomics in fisheries conservation.",2013,"atlantic cod; divergent selection; genome scan; outlier loci; population genomics; single nucleotide polymorphism","Article","ISI","no",NA,NA

We first show that populations are adapted to local salinity in a key reproductive trait, the proportion of motile sperm. Thereafter, we show that genome variation at 22,190 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) shows strong differentiation among populations along the gradient.

"Genome wide analysis reveals genetic divergence between Goldsinny wrasse populations","10.1186/s12863-020-00921-8","Jansson, E; Besnier, F; Malde, K; Andre, C; Dahle, G; Glover, KA","Background: Marine fish populations are often characterized by high levels of gene flow and correspondingly low genetic divergence. This presents a challenge to define management units. Goldsinny wrasse (Ctenolabrus rupestris) is a heavily exploited species due to its importance as a cleaner-fish in commercial salmonid aquaculture. However, at the present, the population genetic structure of this species is still largely unresolved. Here, full-genome sequencing was used to produce the first genomic reference for this species, to study population-genomic divergence among four geographically distinct populations, and, to identify informative SNP markers for future studies. Results: After construction of a de novo assembly, the genome was estimated to be highly polymorphic and of similar to 600Mbp in size. 33,235 SNPs were thereafter selected to assess genomic diversity and differentiation among four populations collected from Scandinavia, Scotland, and Spain. GlobalF(ST)among these populations was 0.015-0.092. Approximately 4% of the investigated loci were identified as putative global outliers, and similar to 1% within Scandinavia. SNPs showing large divergence (F-ST > 0.15) were picked as candidate diagnostic markers for population assignment. One hundred seventy-three of the most diagnostic SNPs between the two Scandinavian populations were validated by genotyping 47 individuals from each end of the species' Scandinavian distribution range. Sixty-nine of these SNPs were significantly (p < 0.05) differentiated (meanF(ST_173_loci) = 0.065, F-ST_69_loci = 0.140). Using these validated SNPs, individuals were assigned with high probability (>= 94%) to their populations of origin. Conclusions: Goldsinny wrasse displays a highly polymorphic genome, and substantial population genomic structure. Diversifying selection likely affects population structuring globally and within Scandinavia. The diagnostic loci identified now provide a promising and cost-efficient tool to investigate goldsinny wrasse populations further.",2020,"assignment; ctenolabrus rupestris; marker validation; population genomics; resequencing; snp","Article","ISI","no",NA,NA

As the ecologically and commercially important small-sized shallow-sea fish, Collichthys lucidus plays a vital role in the structure and functioning of marine ecosystem processes. C. lucidus has been shown to have an obvious population structure. Therefore, it is an ideal candidate for investigating population differentiation and local adaptation under heterogeneous environmental pressure. Results A total of 184,708 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified and applied to elucidate the fine-scale genetic structure and local thermal adaptation of 8 C. lucidus populations. Population structure analysis based on all SNPs indicated that the northern group and southern group of C. lucidus have a strong differentiation. Moreover, 314 SNPs were found to be significantly associated with temperature variation, and annotations of genes containing temperature-related SNPs suggested that genes were involved in material (protein, lipid, and carbohydrate) metabolism and immune responses. Conclusion The high genetic differentiation of 8 C. lucidus populations may have been caused by long-term geographic isolation during the glacial period. Moreover, we suspected that variation in these genes associated with material (protein, lipid, and carbohydrate) metabolism and immune responses was critical for adaptation to spatially heterogeneous temperatures in natural C. lucidus populations. In conclusion, this study could help us determine how C. lucidus populations will respond to future ocean temperature rising.",2021,"collichthys lucidus; genetic diversity; population structure; local adaptive; population genomics","Article","ISI","no",NA,NA
"Population structure, genetic connectivity, and adaptation in the Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida) along the west coast of North America","10.1111/eva.12766","Silliman, K","Effective management of threatened and exploited species requires an understanding of both the genetic connectivity among populations and local adaptation. The Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida), patchily distributed from Baja California to the central coast of Canada, has a long history of population declines due to anthropogenic stressors. For such coastal marine species, population structure could follow a continuous isolation-by-distance model, contain regional blocks of genetic similarity separated by barriers to gene flow, or be consistent with a null model of no population structure. To distinguish between these hypotheses in O. lurida, 13,424 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were used to characterize rangewide population structure, genetic connectivity, and adaptive divergence. Samples were collected across the species range on the west coast of North America, from southern California to Vancouver Island. A conservative approach for detecting putative loci under selection identified 235 SNPs across 129 GBS loci, which were functionally annotated and analyzed separately from the remaining neutral loci. While strong population structure was observed on a regional scale in both neutral and outlier markers, neutral markers had greater power to detect fine-scale structure. Geographic regions of reduced gene flow aligned with known marine biogeographic barriers, such as Cape Mendocino, Monterey Bay, and the currents around Cape Flattery. The outlier loci identified as under putative selection included genes involved in developmental regulation, sensory information processing, energy metabolism, immune response, and muscle contraction. These loci are excellent candidates for future research and may provide targets for genetic monitoring programs. Beyond specific applications for restoration and management of the Olympia oyster, this study lends to the growing body of evidence for both population structure and adaptive differentiation across a range of marine species exhibiting the potential for panmixia.

Here, we sequence restriction site-associated DNA to characterize genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a broadly distributed and highly migratory large pelagic fish, striped marlin (Kajikia audax). Assessment of over 4,000 SNPs resolved spatiotemporal patterns of genetic connectivity throughout the species range in the Pacific and, for the first time, Indian oceans. Individual-based cluster analyses identified six genetically distinct populations corresponding with the western Indian, eastern Indian, western South Pacific, and eastern central Pacific oceans, as well as two populations in the North Pacific Ocean (F-ST = 0.0137-0.0819). F-ST outlier analyses identified a subset of SNPs (n = 59) putatively under the influence of natural selection and capable of resolving populations separated by comparatively high degrees of genetic differentiation. Temporal collections available for some regions demonstrated the stability of allele frequencies over three to five generations of striped marlin. Relative migration rates reflected lower levels of genetic connectivity between Indian Ocean populations (m(R) <= 0.37) compared with most populations in the Pacific Ocean (m(R) >= 0.57) and highlight the importance of the western South Pacific in facilitating gene flow between ocean basins. Collectively, our results provide novel insights into rangewide population structure for striped marlin and highlight substantial inconsistencies between genetically distinct populations and stocks currently recognized for fisheries management. More broadly, we demonstrate that species capable of longdistance dispersal in environments lacking obvious physical barriers to movement can display substantial population subdivision that persists over multiple generations and that may be facilitated by both neutral and adaptive processes. Importantly, surveys of genome-wide markers enable inference of population-level relationships using sample sizes practical for large pelagic fishes of conservation concern.",2020,"dart; genetic connectivity; highly migratory; large pelagic fish; population genomics; snps; striped marlin; temporal stability","Article","ISI","no",NA,NA

Genotyping a large number of samples can improve the detection of subtle genetic structure, but this may substantially increase sequencing cost and downstream bioinformatics computational time. To overcome this challenge, alternative, cost-effective sequencing approaches, namely Pool-seq and Rapture, have been developed. We empirically measured the power of resolution and congruence of these two methods in documenting weak population structure in nonmodel species with high gene flow comparatively to a conventional genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) approach. For this, we used the American lobster (Homarus americanus) as a case study. First, we found that GBS, Rapture, and Pool-seq approaches gave similar allele frequency estimates (i.e., correlation coefficient over 0.90) and all three revealed the same weak pattern of population structure. Yet, Pool-seq data showed F-ST estimates three to five times higher than GBS and Rapture, while the latter two methods returned similar F-ST estimates, indicating that individual-based approaches provided more congruent results than Pool-seq. We conclude that despite higher costs, GBS and Rapture are more convenient approaches to use in the case of species exhibiting very weak differentiation. While both GBS and Rapture approaches provided similar results with regard to estimates of population genetic parameters, GBS remains more cost-effective in project involving a relatively small numbers of genotyped individuals (e.g., <1,000).

Risk management requires genetic information to establish appropriate management units and infer introduction and dispersal routes. We investigated one of the most successful marine invaders, the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi, and used genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) to explore the spatial population structure in its nonindigenous range in the North Sea. We analyzed 140 specimens collected in different environments, including coastal and estuarine areas, and ports along the coast. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were called in approximately 40 k GBS loci. Population structure based on the neutral SNP panel was significant (F-ST .02; p < .01), and a distinct genetic cluster was identified in a port along the Belgian coast (Ostend port; pairwise F-ST .02-.04; p < .01). Remarkably, no population structure was detected between geographically distant regions in the North Sea (the Southern part of the North Sea vs. the Kattegat/Skagerrak region), which indicates substantial gene flow at this geographical scale and recent population expansion of nonindigenous M. leidyi. Additionally, seven specimens collected at one location in the indigenous range (Chesapeake Bay, USA) were highly differentiated from the North Sea populations (pairwise F-ST .36-.39; p < .01).

Here, we report a population genetic study of the deep-sea mussel Bathymodiolus platifrons (Bivalvia: Mytilidae) widely distributed in chemosynthesis-based ecosystems in the Northwest Pacific. Three mitochondrial genes (i.e., atp6, cox1, and nad4) and 6,398 genomewide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained from 110 individuals from four hydrothermal vents and two methane seeps. When using the three mitochondrial genes, nearly no genetic differentiation was detected for B. platifrons in the Northwest Pacific. Nevertheless, when using SNP datasets, all individuals in the South China Sea (SCS) and three individuals in Sagami Bay (SB) together formed one genetic cluster that was distinct from the remaining individuals. Such genetic divergence indicated a genetic barrier to gene flow between the SCS and the open Northwest Pacific, resulting in the co-occurrence of two cryptic semi-isolated lineages. When using 125 outlier SNPs identified focusing on individuals in the Okinawa Trough (OT) and SB, a minor genetic subdivision was detected between individuals in the southern OT (S-OT) and those in the middle OT (M-OT) and SB. This result indicated that, although under the influence of the Kuroshio Current and the North Pacific Intermediate Water, subtle geographic barriers may exist between the S-OT and the M-OT. Introgression analyses based on these outlier SNPs revealed that Hatoma Knoll in the S-OT represents a possible contact zone for individuals in the OT-SB region.

Green crab populations in eastern North America are associated with two independent invasions, previously shown to consist of distinct northern and southern ecotypes, with a contact zone in southern Nova Scotia, Canada.

Furthermore, a spatial principal components analysis conducted on genomic and geographic data revealed a high degree of global structure (p<.0001) partitioning a northern and southern ecotype. Redundancy and partial redundancy analyses revealed that among the environmental variables tested, winter sea surface temperature had the strongest association with spatial structuring, suggesting that it is an important factor defining range and expansion limits of each ecotype.

"Strong population differentiation in lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus) is driven by a small portion of the genome","10.1111/eva.13037","Longo, GC; Lam, L; Basnett, B; Samhouri, J; Hamilton, S; Andrews, K; Williams, G; Goetz, G; McClure, M; Nichols, KM","Delimiting intraspecific genetic variation in harvested species is crucial to the assessment of population status for natural resource management and conservation purposes. Here, we evaluated genetic population structure in lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus), a commercially and recreationally important fishery species along the west coast of North America. We used 16,749 restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) markers, in 611 individuals collected from across the bulk of the species range from Southeast Alaska to Baja California, Mexico. In contrast to previous population genetic work on this species, we found strong evidence for two distinct genetic clusters. These groups separated latitudinally with a break near Point Reyes off Northern California, and there was a high frequency of admixed individuals in close proximity to the break. F-statistics corroborate this genetic break between northern and southern sampling sites, although most loci are characterized by low F(ST)values, suggesting high gene flow throughout most of the genome. Outlier analyses identified 182 loci putatively under divergent selection, most of which mapped to a single genomic region. When individuals were grouped by cluster assignment (northern, southern, and admixed), 71 loci were fixed between the northern and southern cluster, all of which were identified in the outlier scans. All individuals identified as admixed exhibited near 50:50 assignment to northern and southern clusters and were heterozygous for most fixed loci. Alignments of RADseq loci to a draft lingcod genome assembly and three other teleost genomes with chromosome-level assemblies suggest that outlier and fixed loci are concentrated on a single chromosome. Similar genomic patterns have been attributed to chromosomal inversions in diverse taxonomic groups. Regardless of the evolutionary mechanism, these results represent novel observations of genetic structure in lingcod and designate clear evolutionary units that could be used to inform fisheries management.",2020,"fisheries management; heterogeneous genomic divergence; latitudinal cline; northeast pacific ocean; population genomics; rad sequencing","Article","ISI","no",NA,NA
"Genome-wide analysis reveals the genetic stock structure of hoki (Macruronus novaezelandiae)","10.1111/eva.13317","Koot, E; Wu, C; Ruza, I; Hilario, E; Storey, R; Wells, R; Chagne, D; Wellenreuther, M","The assessment of the genetic structuring of biodiversity is crucial for management and conservation. This is particularly critical for widely distributed and highly mobile deep-water teleosts, such as hoki (Macruronus novaezelandiae). This species is significant to Maori people and supports the largest commercial fishery in New Zealand, but uncertainty about its stock structure presents a challenge for management. Here, we apply a comprehensive genomic analysis to shed light on the demographic structure of this species by (1) assembling the genome, (2) generating a catalogue of genome-wide SNPs to infer the stock structure and (3) identifying regions of the genome under selection. The final genome assembly used short and long reads and is near complete, representing 93.8% of BUSCO genes, and consisting of 566 contigs totalling 501 Mb. Whole-genome re-sequencing of 510 hoki sampled from 14 locations around New Zealand and Australia, at a read depth greater than 10x, produced 227,490 filtered SNPs. Analyses of these SNPs were able to resolve the stock structure of hoki into two genetically and geographically distinct clusters, one including the Australian and the other one all New Zealand locations, indicating genetic exchange between these regions is limited. Location differences within New Zealand samples were much more subtle (global F-ST = 0.0006), and while small and significant differences could be detected, they did not conclusively identify additional substructures. Ten putative adaptive SNPs were detected within the New Zealand samples, but these also did not geographically partition the dataset further. Contemporary and historical N-e estimation suggest the current New Zealand population of hoki is large yet declining. Overall, our study provides the first genomic resources for hoki and provides detailed insights into the fine-scale population genetic structure to inform the management of this species.",2021,"genomics; hoki; macruronus; population; single nucleotide polymorphism; stock structure","Article","ISI","no",NA,NA
"Genomic signatures of evolution in Nautilus-An endangered living fossil","10.1111/mec.14344","Combosch, DJ; Lemer, S; Ward, PD; Landman, NH; Giribet, G","Living fossils are survivors of previously more diverse lineages that originated millions of years ago and persisted with little morphological change. Therefore, living fossils are model organisms to study both long-term and ongoing adaptation and speciation processes. However, many aspects of living fossil evolution and their persistence in the modern world remain unclear. Here, we investigate three major aspects of the evolutionary history of living fossils: cryptic speciation, population genetics and effective population sizes, using members of the genera Nautilus and Allonautilus as classic examples of true living fossils. For this, we analysed genome-wide ddRAD-Seq data for all six currently recognized nautiloid species throughout their distribution range. Our analyses identified three major allopatric Nautilus clades: a South Pacific clade, subdivided into three subclades with no signs of admixture between them; a Coral Sea clade, consisting of two genetically distinct populations with significant admixture; and a widespread Indo-Pacific clade, devoid of significant genetic substructure. Within these major clades, we detected five Nautilus groups, which likely correspond to five distinct species. With the exception of Nautilus macromphalus, all previously described species are at odds with genome-wide data, testifying to the prevalence of cryptic species among living fossils. Detailed FST analyses further revealed significant genome-wide and locus-specific signatures of selection between species and differentiated populations, which is demonstrated here for the first time in a living fossil. Finally, approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) simulations suggest large effective population sizes, which may explain the low levels of population differentiation commonly observed in living fossils.",2017,"ddrad-seq; evolutionary genomics; mollusca; nautilus; phylogenetics; population genetics","Article","ISI","no",NA,NA

School sharks, Galeorhinus galeus, are targeted by commercial fisheries in Australia and New Zealand. The Australian stock has been depleted to below 20% of its virgin biomass, and the species is recorded as Conservation Dependent within Australia. Individuals are known to move between both countries, but it is disputed whether the stocks are reproductively linked. Accurate and unbiased determination of stock and population connectivity is crucial to inform effective management. In this study, we assess the genetic composition and population connectivity between Australian and New Zealand school sharks using genome-wide SNPs, while accounting for non-random kin sampling. Between 2009 and 2013, 88 neonate and juvenile individuals from Tasmanian and New Zealand nurseries were collected and genotyped. Neutral loci were analyzed to detect fine-scale signals of reproductive connectivity. Seven full-sibling groups were identified and removed for unbiased analysis. Based on 6,587 neutral SNPs, pairwise genetic differentiation from Tasmanian and New Zealand neonates was non-significant (F-ST=0.0003, CI95=[-0.0002, 0.0009], p=0.1163; D-est=0.00060.0002). This pattern was supported by clustering results.

"POPULATION GENOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE BLUE CRAB CALLINECTES SAPIDUS USING GENOTYPING-BY-SEQUENCING","10.2983/035.036.0128","Plough, LV","Previous genetic studies of the blue crab Callinectes sapidus along the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf coasts have reported weak or temporally variable spatial structure, suggesting high gene flow among distant populations possibly facilitated by long-distance larval dispersal or other features of blue crab life history. The use of relatively few genetic markers, however, may have limited power to detect subtle but significant structure that could inform fisheries management. In this study, the potential for genome-scale datasets to uncover subtle patterns of population structure in the blue crab was examined using a high-throughput genotyping approach (genotyping-by-sequencing) that generated data for more than 9,600 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in crabs from three populations: Panama City Beach, FL, Agawam River, MA, and Porto Alegre, Brazil. Principle components analyses among the three populations revealed very distinct clustering of the Brazilian samples from U.S. populations, likely reflecting restricted gene flow across the equator. Detailed analysis of population structure between the two U. S. populations revealed low but significant genetic differentiation (F-ST = 0.0103), with F-ST values ranging from -0.05 to 0.48. Previous studies have failed to detect significant genetic structure on a similar geographic scale. F-ST outlier analysis identified 242 loci (2.45% of total) with statistically extreme values at the false discovery rate alpha = 0.05 level, only 16 of which showed significant sequence homology to annotated proteins via BLASTx alignment. Top BLASTx hits were to crustacean or arthropod sequences and 8 of the 16 had high sequence similarity to transposable elements or related machinery. Finally, results of population assignment tests for the two U. S. populations showed that the full marker dataset provided good power to assign individuals back to their population of origin (similar to 83% and 92% success for Panama City Beach and Agawam River, respectively), which dropped significantly when using only 500 randomly selected SNPs (similar to 61% and 72% success). Overall, this study demonstrates the great utility of high-throughput sequencing technologies for characterizing fine-scale patterns of genetic structure in blue crabs, and this approach should substantially improve the delineation of stock structure and further advance our understanding of blue crab population connectivity and ecology.",2017,"f-st; population structure; blue crabs; connectivity; dispersal; genomics; callinectes sapidus","Article","ISI","no",NA,NA

Heterogeneous genomic divergence among populations may reflect environmental selection. Advancing our understanding of the mechanisms by which organisms adapt to different temperatures in response to climate change and predicting the adaptive potential and ecological consequences of anthropogenic global warming are critical. We sequenced the whole genomes of Japanese whiting (Sillago japonica) specimens collected from different latitudinal locations along the coastal waters of China and Japan to detect possible thermal adaptations. Using population genomics, a total of 5.48 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from five populations revealed a complete genetic break between the Chinese and Japanese groups, which was attributed to both geographic distance and local adaptation. The shared natural selection genes between two isolated populations (i.e., Zhoushan and Ise Bay/Tokyo Bay) indicated possible parallel evolution at the genetic level induced by temperature. These genes also indicated that the process of temperature selection on isolated populations is repeatable. Moreover, we observed natural candidate genes related to membrane fluidity, possibly underlying adaptation to cold environmental stress. These findings advance our understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying the rapid adaptations of fish species. Species distribution projection models suggested that the Chinese and Japanese groups may have different responses to future climate change, with the former expanding and the latter contracting. The findings of this study enhance our understanding of genetic differentiation and adaptation to changing environments.",2021,"sillago japonica; local adaptation; climate change; temperature stress; whole-genome resequencing","Article","ISI","no",NA,NA

Consequently, it has been the focus of intensive fisheries research for more than 20 years. Here, we present a genomic analysis of population structure that uses a landscape genetics approach to characterize patterns of variation in adult red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) alongside a synoptic view of decades of stock-structure research. The results support Atlantic and GOM stocks and indicate weak heterogeneity within the GOM. Furthermore, redundancy analysis using Moran Eigenvector Maps based on physical distance, larval dispersal probability, and adult dispersal probability reveal heterogeneity on various spatial scales, with adult movement explaining a larger component of variation than spatial position or larval dispersal. Results of this study support the idea that red snapper in the GOM display metapopulation structure, but also suggest a potential genetic discontinuity along the West Florida Shelf not previously described. The approach of using landscape genomics and dispersal data (larval and/or adult) to better understand metapopulation dynamics is promising for not only red snapper, but also for other marine species that occupy a diversity of habitats and are seemingly distributed continuously. © 2021 The Author(s).",2022,"adult movement; landscape genetics; larval dispersal; lutjanus campechanus; next-generation sequencing","Article","SCOPUS","no",NA,NA
"Seascape genomics identify adaptive barriers correlated to tidal amplitude in the shore crab Carcinus maenas","10.1111/mec.16371","Jahnke M., Moknes P.-O., Le Moan A., Martens G.A., Jonsson P.R.","Most marine invertebrates disperse during a planktonic larval stage that may drift for weeks with ocean currents. A challenge for larvae of coastal species is to return to coastal nursery habitats. Shore crab (Carcinus maenas L.) larvae are known to show tidal rhythmicity in vertical migration in tidal areas and circadian rhythmicity in microtidal areas, which seems to increase successful coastal settlement. We studied genome-wide differentiation based on 24,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms of 12 native populations of shore crab sampled from a large tidal amplitude gradient from macrotidal (~8 m) to microtidal (~0.2 m). Dispersal and recruitment success of larvae was assessed with a Lagrangian biophysical model, which showed a strong effect of larval behaviour on long-term connectivity, and dispersal barriers that partly coincided with different tidal environments. The genetic population structure showed a subdivision of the samples into three clusters, which represent micro-, meso- and macrotidal areas. The genetic differentiation was mostly driven by 0.5% outlier loci, which showed strong allelic clines located at the limits between the three tidal areas. Demographic modelling suggested that the two genetic barriers have different origins. Differential gene expression of two clock genes (cyc and pdp1) further highlighted phenotypic differences among genetic clusters that are potentially linked to the differences in larval behaviour. Taken together, our seascape genomic study suggests that tidal regime acts as a strong selection force on shore crab population structure, consistent with larval behaviour affecting dispersal and recruitment success. © 2022 The Authors.

"Climate differently influences the genomic patterns of two sympatric marine fish species","10.1111/1365-2656.13623","Boulanger E., Benestan L., Guerin P.-E., Dalongeville A., Mouillot D., Manel S.","Climate influences population genetic variation in marine species. Capturing these impacts remains challenging for marine fishes which disperse over large geographical scales spanning steep environmental gradients. It requires the extensive spatial sampling of individuals or populations, representative of seascape heterogeneity, combined with a set of highly informative molecular markers capable of revealing climatic-associated genetic variations. We explored how space, dispersal and environment shape the genomic patterns of two sympatric fish species in the Mediterranean Sea, which ranks among the oceanic basins most affected by climate change and human pressure. We hypothesized that the population structure and climate-associated genomic signatures of selection would be stronger in the less mobile species, as restricted gene flow tends to facilitate the fixation of locally adapted alleles. To test our hypothesis, we genotyped two species with contrasting dispersal abilities: the white seabream Diplodus sargus and the striped red mullet Mullus surmuletus. We collected 823 individuals and used genotyping by sequencing (GBS) to detect 8,206 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for the seabream and 2,794 for the mullet. For each species, we identified highly differentiated genomic regions (i.e. outliers) and disentangled the relative contribution of space, dispersal and environmental variables (climate, marine primary productivity) on the outliers' genetic structure to test the prevalence of gene flow and local adaptation. We observed contrasting patterns of gene flow and adaptive genetic variation between the two species. The seabream showed a distinct Alboran sea population and panmixia across the Mediterranean Sea. The mullet revealed additional differentiation within the Mediterranean Sea that was significantly correlated to summer and winter temperatures, as well as marine primary productivity. Functional annotation of the climate-associated outlier SNPs then identified candidate genes involved in heat tolerance that could be examined to further predict species' responses to climate change. Our results illustrate the key steps of a comparative seascape genomics study aiming to unravel the evolutionary processes at play in marine species, to better anticipate their response to climate change. Defining population adaptation capacities and environmental niches can then serve to incorporate evolutionary processes into species conservation planning. © 2021 British Ecological Society",2021,"climate change; comparative seascape genomics; gene flow; local adaptation; mediterranean sea","Article","SCOPUS","no",NA,NA

They also allow for more accurate predictions of how future environmental change might affect marine species. The Persian/Arabian Gulf is extreme in both temperature and salinity, whereas the adjacent Gulf of Oman has conditions more typical of tropical oceans. The sea urchin Echinometra sp. EZ inhabits both of these seas and plays a critical role in coral reef health as a grazer and bioeroder, but, to date, there have been no population genomic studies on this or any urchin species in this unique region. E sp. EZ's life history traits (e.g., large population sizes, large reproductive clutches, and long life spans), in theory, should homogenize populations unless nonneutral processes are occurring. Here, we generated a draft genome and a restriction site-associated DNA sequencing data set from seven populations along an environmental gradient across the Persian/ Arabian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. The estimated genome size of E. sp. EZ was 609 Mb and the heterozygosity was among the highest recorded for an echinoderm at 4.5%. We recovered 918 high-quality SNPs from 85 individuals which we then used in downstream analyses. Population structure analyses revealed a high degree of admixture between all sites, although there was population differentiation and significant pairwise FST values between the two seas. Preliminary results suggest migration is bidirectional between the seas and nine candidate loci were identified as being under putative natural selection, including one collagen gene.
